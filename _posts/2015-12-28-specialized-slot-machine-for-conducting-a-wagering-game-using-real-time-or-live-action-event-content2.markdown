This patent application relates to gaming machines slot machines computer implemented software networked systems and gaming systems according to one embodiment and more specifically to a specialized slot machine for conducting a wagering game using real time or live action event content.

The gaming industry casinos and gambling venues have used gaming machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like for many years. Slot machines have proven to be very popular with players and profitable for the venue. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the possibility of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Players are usually attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines which are constructed with features and enhancements to attract frequent play and increase profitability for the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for slot machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improve gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player. However current gaming systems are based on the use of pre defined sets of cards or displays e.g. types of fruit symbols etc. that form the content used in the wagering games implemented by the gaming systems. Casinos have been unable use these gaming systems to implement wagering games that are based on the use of variable content real time content or live action content. Additionally casinos have been unable to exploit an opportunity to enter the exploding fantasy sports market via traditional slot machines or other gaming systems that are designed to create games of intense skill based strategy.

As popular as fantasy sports has been over the last decade there has been a huge void that nobody has been able to fill. Fantasy sports tournaments have never been able to create a process where an unlimited number of people can play without creating a lottery type of effect. A lottery effect is the very undesirable result of having so many fantasy players entered in a tournament that there is no longer enough room to have them play each other in head to head matchups. Unfortunately the solution for tournaments with these types of spacing issues has always been to force the entire field to compete against each other simultaneously. This is never a good thing and is very discouraging for the competitors.

There are only two general formats available on the market for participating in fantasy tournaments. Within each tournament structure there are often different variables but when they are stripped down to their bare essence it comes down to two options. One of them creates the aforementioned lottery effect while the other does everything possible to avoid it. The one that avoids the lottery effect creates its own set of problems unique to itself. As far as tournament play is concerned neither is a viable way for an unlimited number of players to enter without having to play the entire field at the same time. Some of the features of these two tournament paradigms along with some of their limitations are described below.

Fantasy players are matched up against a single opponent to compete against for a given round. The fantasy player whose athletes score more combined fantasy points are declared the winner and their opponent is declared the loser. The won lost records of these fantasy players are recorded. The better records receive special recognition. Duplication of athletes is not permitted in these tournaments. Often leagues are actually built within the tournament structure. Fantasy players are allowed to remain in the tournament for quite some time even if they happen to be performing poorly. There is a selection process in place where fantasy players either bid on or draft athletes. Lineups are submitted from a very limited and well defined pool of athletes. They consist of athletes that a fantasy player has on their roster that they either drafted or bid on.

There are limits to the number of fantasy players that can play in these types of tournaments because of spacing issues. In other words there are a finite number of slots available to allow people to consistently play head to head with each other over a relatively short season. When limits are placed on the number of people that can play it triggers a very bad combination of events if the intent is to offer a monetary prize. The head to head format limits the amount of prize money that can be given out. This is because there aren t enough people paying an entry fee to support a large prize money pool. Compounding the problem is the high pricing strategy for entry fees which is often used to compensate for the limited number of fantasy players that are able to compete. This is done to create a larger pool for the prize money but this strategy prices most fantasy sports enthusiasts out of participating.

Some tournament formats operate as a lottery style tournament because the format mirrors what a lottery does. For example millions of people can select the number 3 in a lottery and share that number. But the number is meaningless unless that number is selected as one of the winning numbers and the other five or six numbers that the lottery player has are also selected as winning numbers. The same thing happens with fantasy sports lottery tournaments. Three million people might have the highest scoring athlete for a given day week or month but how many of them have that in combination with the next five or six highest scoring athletes This is a very unlikely combination to have and is why this style of play mimics a lottery. The lottery effect format requires hundreds thousands or even an unlimited number of entries to play each other simultaneously. Duplication of athletes is permitted because there aren t enough athletes to go around. This is the only way millions can play each other simultaneously. Tournaments are usually structured so that running point totals of fantasy players are compared on an ongoing basis. The goal is to have the highest running point total possible in the event that hundreds to millions of fantasy players are all competing against each other. Tournament structure always forces fantasy players to compete against the entire field. Sometimes it is for one day and sometimes it is for the whole season and sometimes it is something in between. Cumulative running point total separates the fantasy players rather than a won lost record like with the head to head format. The top cumulative point scorers receive special recognition. Lineups are submitted from the entire pool of available athletes with little to no restrictions.

Fantasy players compete against the entire field simultaneously. Tournament format not conducive to charging an entry fee although some do because fantasy players are not optimistic they can beat out hundreds to millions of players at the same time for the high score. Generally considered an inferior format to the match play method because it is nothing more than an accumulated points system over a day week month or entire season and forces fantasy players to compete against the entire field at the same time.

Not all fantasy tournaments have every feature described in the two formats above. However all of them though have enough of them in combination with one another to create insurmountable roadblocks for the type of tournament the applicant believes is needed to fill the hole in the industry. The only way around them is to seek non traditional solutions. Ultimately the goal is to create a vehicle so that an unlimited number of fantasy players can participate without having to play the entire field simultaneously. Again there isn t a single format currently in existence on the market that allows this to happen. The reason for this is that there are several non obvious features that are required to make this happen.

The primary tournaments that have either been or are currently on the market are described below. In 2004 Payday Sports offered a million dollar prize to the winner of their fantasy football tournament. The entry fee was 3 600. Analysis The tournament failed because even though the prize money was appropriate and the competitors weren t forced to play the entire field simultaneously the entry fee was not conducive to attracting the masses.

In 2004 the Million Dollar Fantasy League held a fantasy football tournament that offered a one million dollar grand prize. The entry fee was 2 600. Analysis This tournament failed for the same reason the Payday sports one did. The prize money was good they also got it right by not forcing competitors to compete against the entire field but once again the entry fee was way too high.

In 2008 Fanball held a million dollar fantasy football tournament where the entry fee was 125. It failed in the second year because they were unable to pay the prize money. This tournament was a much better attempt at creating an entry fee that was conducive to attract the masses but it still wasn t low enough. Consequently it fared no better than the others because the price was still way too high for the average player and the tournament format was so structurally flawed they couldn t go any lower. Their primary issue was that they didn t have an understanding of how to create enough space for more fantasy players to enter. This became quite apparent by their use of a league format. Instead of eliminating poor performers to make room for more entries they allowed them to remain in the tournament. The ramifications for doing it this way along with some other strategic mistakes resulted in the fact that they could not go any lower on the entry fee without making all the competitors compete against the entire field simultaneously. The bottom line is that even though Fanball tried entry fees that were significantly lower than previous attempts their faulty methodology still forced them to keep them too high to attract the masses. More importantly even if they had been able to attract the masses with their better pricing they still didn t have a system in place to accommodate that many entries without offering a Lottery Effect format. The Fanball fiasco is one example of why the solutions to create an effective tournament format are not obvious.

FanDuel has been hosting a tournament for two years that they hope will eventually pay the winner one million dollars in 2012 the winner received 150 000 . Their entry fee is either 10 or 109. Analysis FanDuel is a good illustration of how big money fantasy sports tournaments struggle with trying to avoid the Lottery Effect while at the same time trying to offer a big money grand prize. What they have created is a paradigm that offers two types of qualifying tournaments for a chance to compete in a 24 person tournament that crowns the winner with 150 000. For the 109 qualifier they limit it to 250 people each week that it is run. For the 10 qualifier they cap it at just over 2 000 entries. The intent is to minimize the Lottery Effect by capping the number of people who can participate but it is still creates a Lottery Effect when you have to be the best score in a large field to qualify. Moreover the prize money to the winner is compromised and can never be in the multi millions of dollars because they are creating caps for the number of people that can enter. The FanDuel format is a good example to illustrate the problem that currently exists. Nobody has been able to determine how to offer the multi million dollar grand prize without forcing contestants to simultaneously play millions of people. FanDuel clearly is trying to address the issue but because of their flawed strategies in creating their format they offer BOTH the Lottery Effect and a less than desirable grand prize in their offering.

The National Fantasy Football Championship Primetime NFFCP is offering a 150 000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL season. Their entry fee is 1 500. Analysis The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries because they haven t developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.

The National Fantasy Football Championship Classic NFFCC is offering a 75 000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL season. Their entry fee is 1 500. Analysis The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries because they haven t developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.

The Fantasy Football Players Championship FFPC is offering a 200 000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL season. Their entry fee is 1 600. Analysis The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries because they haven t developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.

The World Championship of Fantasy Football WCFF is offering a 200 000 grand prize for the 2012 NFL season. Their entry fee is 1 575. Analysis The prize money is not in the millions and the entry fee is way too high to attract the masses. The format limits the number of entries because they haven t developed a tournament format that allows a large number of fantasy players to compete.

It will be evident however to one of ordinary skill in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.

An Example Embodiment Implemented as a Specialized Slot Machine a Specialized Lottery Machine or Other Specialized Gaming System for Conducting Wagering Games Using Real Time or Live Action Event Content

Referring now to a slot machine can be used in gaming venues such as casinos. With regard to the example embodiments described herein the slot machine may be any type of slot machine and may have varying structures and methods of operation. For example the slot machine may be an electromechanical gaming machine configured to play mechanical slots or it may be an electronic gaming machine configured to play a video casino game such as slots keno poker blackjack roulette etc. The slot machine may also be an electromechanical lottery machine in an alternative embodiment.

The slot machine comprises a housing and includes input devices including a value input device and a player input device . For output the slot machine includes a primary display for displaying information about the basic wagering game. The primary display can also display information about a bonus wagering game and a progressive wagering game. The slot machine may also include a secondary display for displaying game events game outcomes and or signage information. While these typical components found in the slot machine are described below it should be understood that numerous other elements may exist and may be used in any number of combinations to create various forms of a slot machine .

The value input device may be provided in many forms individually or in combination and is preferably located on the front of the housing . The value input device receives currency and or credits that are inserted by a player. The value input device may include a coin acceptor for receiving coin currency see . Alternatively or in addition the value input device may include a bill acceptor for receiving paper currency. Furthermore the value input device may include a ticket reader a barcode scanner or a QR code scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket a card or other tangible portable credit storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account which can transfer money to the slot machine .

The player input device comprises a plurality of push buttons on a button panel for operating the slot machine . In addition or alternatively the player input device may comprise a touch screen mounted by adhesive tape or the like over the primary display and or secondary display . The touch screen contains soft touch keys denoted by graphics on the underlying primary display and used to operate the slot machine . The touch screen provides players with an alternative method of input. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen at an appropriate touch key or by pressing an appropriate push button on the button panel. The touch keys may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game while the touch keys may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game. In another implementation a lever or handle on the side of the slot machine can be used by a user to provide input to the slot machine .

The various components of the slot machine may be connected directly to or contained within the housing as seen in or may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the housing via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods. Thus the slot machine comprises these components whether housed in the housing or outboard of the housing and connected remotely.

The operation of the basic wagering game is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display may take the form of a cathode ray tube CRT display a high resolution liquid crystal display LCD a plasma display an LED light emitting diode display or any other type of display suitable for use in the slot machine . As shown the primary display includes the touch screen overlaying the entire display or a portion thereof to allow players to make game related selections. Alternatively the primary display of the slot machine may include a number of mechanical electromechanical or electronic reels to display the outcome in visual association with at least one payline . In the illustrated embodiment the slot machine is an upright version in which the primary display is oriented vertically relative to the player. Alternatively the slot machine may be a slant top version in which the primary display is slanted at about a thirty degree angle toward the player of the slot machine .

A player begins play of the basic wagering game by making a wager via the value input device of the slot machine . A player can select a type of play by using the player input device via the buttons or the touch screen keys . The basic game consists of a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes can be randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. As described in more detail below for various example embodiments the outcomes can also be based on player input and real time or live action content retrieved by the slot machine from a network information source. At least one of the plurality of outcomes determined by the slot machine may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the slot machine may also include a player information reader that allows for identification ID of a player by reading a card with information indicating his or her true identity. The player information reader is shown in as a card reader but may take on many forms including a ticket reader barcode scanner QR code scanner RFID radio frequency identification transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. Currently identification is generally used by casinos for rewarding certain players with complimentary services or special offers. For example a player may be enrolled in the gaming establishment s loyalty club and may be awarded certain complimentary services as that player collects points in his or her player tracking account. The player inserts his or her card into the player information reader which allows the casino s computers to register that player s wagering at the slot machine . The slot machine may use the secondary display or other dedicated player tracking display for providing the player with information about his or her account or other player specific information. Also in some embodiments the information reader may be used to restore game assets that the player achieved and saved during a previous game session.

Referring now to a handheld or mobile slot machine is illustrated. Like the free standing slot machine the handheld slot machine is preferably an electronic gaming machine configured to play a video casino game such as but not limited to blackjack slots keno poker blackjack and roulette. The handheld slot machine comprises a housing or casing and includes input devices including a value input device and a player input device . For output the handheld slot machine includes but is not limited to a primary display a secondary display one or more speakers one or more player accessible ports e.g. an audio output jack for headphones a video headset jack etc. and other conventional input output I O devices and ports which may or may not be player accessible. In the embodiment depicted in the handheld slot machine comprises a secondary display that is rotatable relative to the primary display . The optional secondary display may be fixed movable and or detachable attachable relative to the primary display . Either the primary display and or secondary display may be configured to display any aspect of a non wagering game wagering game secondary games bonus games progressive wagering games group games shared experience games or events game events game outcomes scrolling information text messaging emails alerts or announcements broadcast information subscription information and handheld slot machine status.

The player accessible value input device may comprise for example a slot located on the front side or top of the casing configured to receive credit from a stored value card e.g. casino card smart card debit card credit card etc. inserted by a player. In another aspect the player accessible value input device may comprise a sensor e.g. an RF radio frequency sensor configured to sense a signal e.g. an RF signal output by a transmitter e.g. an RF transmitter carried by a player. The player accessible value input device may also or alternatively include a ticket reader barcode scanner or QR code scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket a card or other tangible portable credit or funds storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account which can transfer money to the handheld slot machine .

Still other player accessible value input devices may require the use of touch keys on the touch screen display e.g. primary display and or secondary display or player input devices . Upon entry of player identification information and preferably secondary authorization information e.g. a password personal identification number PIN stored value card number predefined key sequences etc. the player may be permitted to access a player s account. As one potential optional security feature the handheld slot machine may be configured to permit a player to only access an account the player has specifically set up for the handheld slot machine . Other conventional security features may also be utilized to for example prevent unauthorized access to a player s account to minimize an impact of any unauthorized access to a player s account or to prevent unauthorized access to any personal information or funds temporarily stored on the handheld slot machine .

The player accessible value input device may itself comprise or utilize a biometric player information reader which permits the player to access available funds on a player s account either alone or in combination with another of the aforementioned player accessible value input devices . In an embodiment wherein the player accessible value input device comprises a biometric player information reader transactions such as an input of value to the handheld device a transfer of value from one player account or source to an account associated with the handheld slot machine or the execution of another transaction for example could all be authorized by a biometric reading which could comprise a plurality of biometric readings from the biometric device.

Alternatively to enhance security a transaction may be optionally enabled only by a two step process in which a secondary source confirms the identity indicated by a primary source. For example a player accessible value input device comprising a biometric player information reader may require a confirmatory entry from another biometric player information reader or from another source such as a credit card debit card player ID identification card fob key PIN personal identification number password hotel room key etc. Thus a transaction may be enabled by for example a combination of the personal identification input e.g. biometric input with a secret PIN or a combination of a biometric input with a fob input or a combination of a fob input with a PIN or a combination of a credit card input with a biometric input. Essentially any two independent sources of identity one of which is secure or personal to the player e.g. biometric readings PIN password etc. could be utilized to provide enhanced security prior to the electronic transfer of any funds. In another aspect the value input device may be provided remotely from the handheld slot machine .

The player input device comprises a plurality of push buttons on a button panel for operating the handheld slot machine . In addition or alternatively the player input device may comprise a touch screen mounted to a primary display and or secondary display . In one aspect the touch screen is matched to a display screen having one or more selectable touch keys selectable by a user s touching of the associated area of the screen using a finger or a tool such as a stylus pointer. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen at an appropriate touch key or by pressing an appropriate push button on the button panel. The touch keys may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game while the touch keys may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game. The various components of the handheld slot machine may be connected directly to or contained within the casing as seen in or may be located outboard of the casing and connected to the casing via a variety of hardwired tethered or wireless connection methods. Thus the handheld slot machine may comprise a single unit or a plurality of interconnected parts e.g. wireless connections which may be arranged to suit a player s preferences.

The operation of the basic wagering game on the handheld slot machine is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display preferably takes the form of a high resolution LCD a plasma display an LED or any other type of display suitable for use in the handheld slot machine . The size of the primary display may vary from for example about a 2 3 display to a 15 or 17 display. In at least some aspects the primary display is a 7 10 display. As the weight of and or power requirements of such displays decreases with improvements in technology it is envisaged that the size of the primary display may be increased. Optionally coatings or removable films or sheets may be applied to the display to provide desired characteristics e.g. anti scratch anti glare bacterially resistant and anti microbial films etc. . In at least some embodiments the primary display and or secondary display may have a 16 9 aspect ratio or other aspect ratio e.g. 4 3 . The primary display and or secondary display may also each have different resolutions different color schemes and different aspect ratios.

As with the free standing slot machine a player begins play of the basic wagering game on the handheld slot machine by making a wager e.g. via the value input device or an assignment of credits stored on the handheld slot machine via the touch screen keys player input device or buttons on the handheld slot machine . In at least some aspects the basic game may comprise a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes can be randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. As described in more detail below for various example embodiments the outcomes can also be based on player input and real time or live action content retrieved by the slot machine from a network information source. At least one of the plurality of outcomes determined by the slot machine may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the player accessible value input device of the handheld slot machine may double as a player information reader that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating the player s identity e.g. reading a player s credit card player ID card smart card etc. . The player information reader may alternatively or also comprise a bar code scanner RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. In one presently preferred aspect the player information reader shown by way of example in comprises a biometric sensing device.

Turning now to the various components of the slot machine are controlled by a central processing unit CPU also referred to herein as a controller or processor such as a microcontroller or microprocessor . To provide gaming functions the controller executes one or more game programs stored in a computer readable storage medium in the form of memory . The controller can perform the random selection using a random number generator RNG of an outcome from the plurality of possible outcomes of the wagering game. Alternatively the random event may be determined at a remote controller. The remote controller may use either an RNG or pooling scheme for its central determination of a game outcome. It should be appreciated that the controller may include one or more microprocessors including but not limited to a master processor a slave processor and a secondary or parallel processor.

The controller is also coupled to the system memory and a money credit detector . The system memory may comprise a volatile memory e.g. a random access memory RAM and a non volatile memory e.g. an EEPROM . The system memory may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money credit detector signals the processor that money and or credits have been input via the value input device . Preferably these components are located within the housing of the slot machine . However as explained above these components may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the remainder of the components of the slot machine via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods.

As seen in the controller is also connected to and controls the primary display the player input device and a payoff mechanism . The payoff mechanism is operable in response to instructions from the controller to award a payoff to the player in response to certain winning outcomes that might occur in the basic game or the bonus game s . The payoff may be provided in the form of points bills tickets coupons cards etc. For example in the payoff mechanism includes both a ticket printer and a coin outlet . However any of a variety of payoff mechanisms well known in the art may be implemented including cards coins tickets smartcards cash etc. The payoff amounts distributed by the payoff mechanism can be determined by one or more pay tables stored in the system memory .

Communications between the controller and both the peripheral components of the slot machine and external systems occur through input output I O circuits . More specifically the controller controls and receives inputs from the peripheral components of the slot machine through the input output circuits . Further the controller communicates with the external systems via the I O circuits and a communication path e.g. serial parallel IR RC 10bT etc. . The external systems may include a gaming network other gaming machines a gaming server a central server a central server database Internet nodes sites communications hardware or a variety of other interfaced systems or components. Although the I O circuits may be shown as a single block it should be appreciated that each of the I O circuits may include a number of different types of I O circuits.

Controller as used herein comprises any combination of hardware software and or firmware that may be disposed or resident inside and or outside of the slot machine that may communicate with and or control the transfer of data between the slot machine and a bus another computer processor or device and or a service and or a network. The controller may comprise one or more controllers or processors. In the controller in the slot machine is depicted as comprising a CPU but the controller may alternatively comprise a CPU in combination with other components such as the I O circuits and the system memory . The controller may reside partially or entirely inside or outside of the machine . The control system for a handheld slot machine may be similar to the control system for the free standing slot machine except that the functionality of the respective on board controllers may vary.

The slot machines may communicate with external systems in a wired or wireless manner such that each machine operates as a thin client having relatively less functionality a thick client having relatively more functionality or through any range of functionality therebetween e.g. a rich client . As a generally thin client the slot machine may operate primarily as a display device to display the results of gaming outcomes processed externally for example on a server as part of the external systems . In this thin client configuration the server executes game code and determines game outcomes e.g. with a random number generator while the controller on board the slot machine processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machine. In an alternative rich client configuration the server determines game outcomes while the controller on board the slot machine executes game code and processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machines. In yet another alternative thick client configuration the controller on board the slot machine executes game code determines game outcomes and processes display information to be displayed on the display s of the machine. Numerous alternative configurations are possible such that the aforementioned and other functions may be performed onboard or external to the slot machine as may be necessary for particular applications. It should be understood that the slot machines may take on a wide variety of forms such as a free standing machine a portable or handheld device primarily used for gaming a mobile telecommunications device such as a mobile telephone or personal digital assistant PDA a counter top or bar top gaming machine or other personal electronic device such as a portable television MP3 player entertainment device etc.

 The Processes Formats and User Interfaces Used in a Fantasy Sports Tournament on the Specialized Slot Machine of an Example Embodiment

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized tournament structure in an example embodiment 

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first bloc of athletes that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the athletes that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 . However this strategy would be counter productive and would virtually guarantee that the contestant would come in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. The bid not only secures athletes by having the lowest bid but the bid also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example a 1 bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the athletes that they desire but this bid also represents the percentage of each athlete s fantasy points that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example if someone bids 1 to win a fantasy football group they desire such as Peyton Manning Calvin Johnson and Marshawn Lynch they will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1 of the fantasy points that each of these three athletes scored in their respective games. As a result a value of the contestant s bid as represented by the percentage bid is used to discount or reduce the contestant s score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.

In the example embodiment the setup may not seem fair in one critical way. For example a bloc of three athletes could potentially have three duds like all kickers for a football contest while another bloc of three athletes has all high value athletes like quarterbacks for the same competition. Isn t this absurd since quarterbacks are much more valuable than kickers In the example embodiment the described format actually turns the selection process into a riveting high wire exercise where skill becomes a major factor. Think of these groups of athletes as stocks. The more valuable the stock the more aggressive the bidding will be. The correct price will be set by the bids. Three kickers at 95 of their fantasy points might be more valuable than three quarterbacks at 12 of their fantasy points. This bidding process creates a tremendous amount of strategy for participants to consider.

In the example embodiment two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below 

Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above one might think that the game is unfair if some blocs might have as low as a 6 multiplier while others might be as high as a 10 multiplier. However this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. Now contestants will have to factor into the calculus the fact that a bloc of strong athletes might be diminished in value because they have a smaller multiplier and a more mediocre group might be increased in value because they are more valued by a higher multiplier. Even if a strong group of athletes has a 10 multiplier this won t be a problem. The appropriate percentage bid for this bloc will be significantly lower than the norm. Conversely a mediocre bloc of athletes with a small multiplier should be able to be secured with a bid considerable higher than the norm.

In the example embodiment as described somebody is going to eventually get a bloc because there is exactly one bloc every contestant everybody is going to eventually need a lineup. All blocs not bid on are called mulligans and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 8 if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When the blocs not bid on are reintroduced and all six blocs have been shown and either bid on or passed on the maximum bid for the reintroduced blocs go down 8 each time a new one is reintroduced and bid on. If there is a tie for a final position amongst tied players the person who secured their bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.

Once the bids are received from the contestants in a group for a particular round the six contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all athletes in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their blocs. The specialized slot machine can tabulate the scores for all of the athletes and then add the three scores together for each bloc of athletes. Each contestant will then be ranked 1 6 one through six on the specialized slot machine user interface screen e.g. see through . For example to tabulate the score of a single athlete three components of information are required. First the athlete s average fantasy game score has to be a part of the database linked to the managing entity website for easy retrieval. The second component of information needed is the bid with which the athlete was secured. Finally the multiplier on the athlete has to be included in the computation. Using football as an example let s assume Tom Brady has a running fantasy game point total of 10. Then assume he is secured at 68 of his fantasy points and the multiplier on him is 3 . Since 68 of 10 is 6.8 and when 6.8 is multiplied by 3 the result is 20.4. This means that Brady s score would be added to the other two athletes in his bloc for a final score to be posted for that contestant. Finally tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc in the later round the higher spot.

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure in an alternative example embodiment. In an alternative embodiment of the specialized fantasy sports slot machine as described above the alternative slot machine embodiment includes everything described above but adds one more variable. This alternative embodiment calls for contestants to create the groups upon which the contestants bid. The process for this alternative embodiment is described below.

The fantasy sports slot machine embodiments as described herein provide a unique idea that has never been seen in the market. In order to make the fantasy sports slot machine embodiments possible there are four key elements that are new to the fantasy sports genre that these embodiments introduce and that support the implementation. These four key elements include the following 

A Fantasy Music Legends Tournament is a tournament format for any genre of music. A given tournament can be designed for a specific genre like Rock Roll Pop Rhythm Blues Country Rap etc. There can also be an Open tournament that allows all genres to be incorporated into one tournament. This concept can be a marketing tool for a company or it can be a standalone tournament that charges an entry fee and offers cash prizes for the top finishers of the Tournament of Champions TOC . If it is used as a marketing tool the tournament can offer interesting music perks for the top finishers. For a Rap tournament the overall winner might win an all expenses paid trip somewhere to see Jay Z perform and also hang out with him before and after the show. A top overall winner might have a different kind of top prize such as winning a rare guitar for their efforts. The key components as a marketing tool are to allow contestants special perks. These perks will allow them to compete in a smaller group size than is normally required or skip a round s entirely. Contestants can take advantage of these perks by purchasing something off a particular website. When they do so they are allowed to skip a round or two or play in a smaller group for the next round. For example someone might be able to play the next round against only 9 people instead of the standard 12 if they purchase a song. They might be able to skip 2 rounds if they buy concert tickets. Legendary musicians eligible to be picked for a Fantasy Music Legends Tournament are any people who have played in a group with two or more people who had at least 1 hit in the top 40 in the United States in their genre of expertise. For example Adam Ridgeley would be eligible because he was a member of Wham and has had at least one hit song that made the Billboard Hot 100 chart for his genre in the U.S. In the example embodiment the tournament does not disqualify someone if their band is missing a piece like a drummer that is usually associated as a key component of a typical band. For example the Carpenters are considered a band by the definitions of this game. Some legendary musicians have played in more than one band. For example Paul McCartney played with The Beatles and with Paul McCartney and Wings. For this reason Legendary Musicians score fantasy points for all bands in which they participated.

The following description provides a general overview of the Fantasy Music Legends Tournament structure in an example embodiment.

Fantasy players that tie for a top three position will use the following tiebreaker process in an example embodiment 

Below is a grid that shows what percentage of Legendary Musician s points a given contestant receives depending on how many other competitors selected that Legendary Musician.

The table below shows the starting Legendary Musicians in the Pop Rock category that a 12 person group selected. The percentage under each musician s name represents the percentage that the fantasy player will get to keep of the actual fantasy points that their given Legendary Musician scored. This percentage is based on the number of times a Legendary Musician was duplicated and is taken directly from the above table Table 1 . It is important to note that if a Legendary Musician performed in more than one band and also had a solo career e.g. Eric Clapton The Yardbirds and Cream and a distinguished solo career all of their works and honors will be computed in their fantasy score.

Profile rankings are achieved by how many consecutive times a contestant advances out of group play by finishing in the top 3 of their group. Some basic profile ranking rules for the example embodiment are provided below.

A plurality of levels can be defined for the Fantasy Band Legends. An example of these various levels for the example embodiment are provided below.

The managing entity presents the Tournament of Champions TOC format for Fantasy Band Legends designed for contestants who advance 10 consecutive rounds during a qualifying competition. The TOC is six rounds with the final round culminating with the top 8 contestants remaining vying for final positions. The same Fantasy Band Legends scoring system described above can be used for the TOC.

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first bloc of Legends that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the Legends that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 . However it would be suicidal and would virtually guarantee them coming in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. It not only secures Legends by having the lowest bid but it also severely penalizes contestants for making absurdly low bids. A 1 bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the Legends that they desire but it also represents the percentage of each Legend s fantasy points that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example if someone bids 1 to win a group they desire such as Paul McCartney Michael Jackson and Keith Richards they will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1 of the fantasy points that EACH of these three musicians scored.

In the example embodiment the setup may not seem fair in one critical way. For example a bloc of three could potentially have three second tier artists and another have three icons. It is possible and yet it is not as absurd as one might think. In the example embodiment the described format actually turns the selection process into a riveting high wire exercise where skill becomes a major factor. Think of these groups of Legends as stocks. The more valuable the stock the more aggressive the bidding will be. The correct price will be set by the bids. Three second tier artists at 95 of their fantasy points might be more valuable than three icons at 12 of their fantasy points.

In the example embodiment three additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below 

In the example embodiment as described somebody is going to eventually get a bloc because there are exactly three cards for every contestant everybody is going to eventually need a lineup. What may happen though is that all blocs not bid on are called mulligans and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 5 if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When they are reintroduced though at the end they go down 5 each time a new one is reintroduced. If there is a tie during fantasy eliminator for last place from the tied players two or more the one who secured their bloc in the latest round automatically is declared the advancing contestant.

In various example embodiments described below real time live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine. These example embodiments bring slot machines into the 21st century and use real life events to transform the specialized slot machine from a static entity that is currently based solely on canned information into a real time live event gaming apparatus.

It is important to distinguish what is meant by a real time live event for the purposes of this example embodiment. An example of what is not meant by a real time live event format is having a bunch of poker players playing in an online slot tournament. This might be a real time live event but that designation only refers to the participants who are playing not the gaming material itself they are using for the tournament. The example embodiments describe real time live action events that constitute the gaming material itself. No longer are slot machines simply based on pre defined sets of cards that show up lining up three consecutive cherries or even spinning a wheel in hopes of creating a fortune. This specialized slot machine and the particular tournament formats of the various example embodiments described herein are based on real time live event data. In other words the decisions the players are making with the game itself are based on events that are happening at the time the game is being played.

This real time live event slot idea can be used for all types of real life events. For the purposes of this example embodiment the described example embodiment uses the specialized slot machine with real time live sporting events to create a new type of slot machine. Even more specifically the described example embodiment is used for fantasy sports by modifying some of the current ways fantasy sports games are played to enhance the real time live event slot machine embodiment as described herein.

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure for real time live sporting events in an example embodiment 

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first bloc of athletes that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the athletes that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 .

If there is a tie for a final position amongst tied players the person who secured their bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.

Once the bids are received from the contestants in a group for a particular round the six contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all athletes in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their blocs. The specialized slot machine can tabulate the scores for all of the athletes and then add the three scores together for each bloc of athletes. Each contestant will then be ranked 1 6 one through six on the specialized slot machine user interface screen e.g. see and . For example to tabulate the score of a single athlete three components of information are required. First the athlete s average fantasy game score has to be a part of the database linked to the managing entity website for easy retrieval. The second component of information needed is the bid with which the athlete was secured. Finally the multiplier on the athlete has to be included in the computation. Using football as an example let s assume Tom Brady has a running fantasy game point total of 10. Then assume he is secured at 68 of his fantasy points and the multiplier on him is 3 . Since 68 of 10 is 6.8 and when 6.8 is multiplied by 3 the result is 20.4. This means that Brady s score would be added to the other two athletes in his bloc for a final score to be posted for that contestant. Finally tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc in the later round the higher spot.

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure in an alternative example embodiment. In an alternative embodiment of the specialized fantasy sports slot machine as described above the alternative slot machine embodiment includes everything described above but adds one more variable. This alternative embodiment calls for contestants to create the groups upon which the contestants bid. The process for this alternative embodiment is described below.

The fantasy sports slot machine embodiments based on real time live action events as described herein provide a unique idea that has never been seen in the market. In these example embodiments the contestants themselves do not constitute the real time live action event s rather it is the game itself that uses real time live action events as the competition unfolds. These example embodiments fundamentally change the way slot machines are currently used. Slot machine players are suddenly playing with the outcomes that are based on events that are unfolding as they are playing. This adds a dimension to slot machines that has never been provided before.

In order to make these fantasy sports slot machine embodiments possible there are three key elements that are new to the fantasy sports genre that these embodiments introduce and that support the implementation. These three key elements include the following 

In various example embodiments described below real time live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine. These example embodiments use real life events to transform the specialized slot machine from a static entity that is currently based solely on canned information into a real time live event gaming apparatus.

As described above the real time live action events of the example embodiments constitute the gaming material itself. This specialized slot machine and the particular tournament formats of the various example embodiments described herein are based on real time live event data. In other words the decisions the players are making with the game itself are based on events that are happening at the time the game is being played.

This real time live event slot idea can be used for all types of real life events. For the purposes of this example embodiment the described example embodiment uses the specialized slot machine with real time live current events e.g. non sporting events to create a new type of specialized slot machine.

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure for current events in an example embodiment 

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first bloc of current events news categories that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the current events news categories that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 . However this strategy would be counter productive and would virtually guarantee that the contestant would come in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. The bid not only secures the bloc of current events news categories by having the lowest bid but the bid also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example a 1 bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the current events news categories that they desire but this bid also represents the percentage of raw points from each current events category that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example if a contestant bids 1 to win the current event categories that they desire which consists of Sports Medicine and Congressional Politics the contestant will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1 of the raw points that each of these categories tallied. As a result a value of the contestant s bid as represented by the percentage bid is used to discount or reduce the contestant s score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.

In the example embodiment two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below 

Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above one might think that the game is unfair if some current events categories might have as low as a 6 multiplier while others might be as high as a 10 multiplier However this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. Now contestants will have to factor into the calculus the fact that a current events category might be diminished in value because it has a smaller multiplier and a less desirable current events category is now more valued because of a higher multiplier. Even if a highly sought after current events category has a 10 multiplier this won t be a problem because it will drive the percentage bid lower to even things out. Conversely a less desirable current events category with a small multiplier should be able to be secured with a bid considerably higher than the norm.

In the example embodiment as described somebody is going to eventually get a bloc because there are no backup current events blocs available and everybody is going to eventually need a bloc. All blocs not bid on are called mulligans and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 8 if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When the blocs not bid on are reintroduced and all six blocs have been shown and either bid on or passed on the maximum bid for the reintroduced blocs go down 8 each time a new one is reintroduced and bid on. If there is a tie for a final position amongst tied players the person who secured their bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.

Once the bids are received from the contestants for a particular round the contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all current events categories in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their blocs. The specialized slot machine will tabulate the scores for all of the current events categories. Once the specialized slot machine tabulates final scores for individual current events categories the specialized slot machine can add the scores together for blocs of current events categories belonging to the same contestant. The contestants will then be ranked 1 6 one through six on the specialized slot machine display screen. For example to tabulate the score of a single current events news category three components of information are required. First the news category s raw score is calculated. The second component of information needed is the bid with which that the news category was secured. Finally the multiplier on the news category is factored in. Let s assume a Religion news category has a 4.7 of the airtime raw score when the bidding process ends. This gives the category a raw score of 4.7 points. Then assume this category is secured with a 68 bid and the multiplier on it is 3 . Because 68 of 4.7 is 3.2 and when 3.2 is multiplied by 3 the result is 9.6. This means that Religion s overall score is 9.6 points and would be added to the scores of their other two current event news categories from their bloc. Finally tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc during the later round the higher finishing spot in the final standings.

In various example embodiments described below real time live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine. These example embodiments use real life events to transform the specialized slot machine from a static entity that is currently based solely on canned information into a real time live event gaming apparatus.

As described above the real time live action events of the example embodiments constitute the gaming material itself. This specialized slot machine and the particular tournament formats of the various example embodiments described herein are based on real time live event data. In other words the decisions the players are making with the game itself are based on events that are happening at the time the game is being played.

This real time live event slot idea can be used for all types of real life events. For the purposes of this example embodiment the described example embodiment uses the specialized slot machine with real time live current political debate events to create a new type of specialized slot machine.

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure for current debate events in an example embodiment 

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first debater or bloc of debaters that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the debater or bloc of debaters that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 . However this strategy would be counter productive and would virtually guarantee that the contestant would come in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. The bid not only secures the debater s by having the lowest bid but the bid also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example a 1 bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the debater s that they desire but this bid also represents the percentage of each debater s points that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example if a contestant bids 1 to win a debater s they desire such as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush the contestant will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1 of the points that each of these debaters scored. As a result a value of the contestant s bid as represented by the percentage bid is used to discount or reduce the contestant s score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.

In the example embodiment two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below 

Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above one might think that the game is unfair if some debaters or blocs of debaters might have as low as a 6 multiplier while others might be as high as a 10 multiplier However this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. Now contestants will have to factor into the calculus the fact that a debater bloc might be diminished in value because they have a smaller multiplier and a less desirable debater bloc is now more valued because of a higher multiplier. Even if a highly sought after debater bloc has a 10 multiplier this won t be a problem because it will drive the percentage bid lower to even things out. Conversely a less desirable debater bloc with a small multiplier should be able to be secured with a bid considerably higher than the norm.

In the example embodiment as described somebody is going to eventually get a bloc because there are no backup debaters blocs available and everybody is going to eventually need a debater bloc. All debaters blocs that are not bid on are called mulligans and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 10 if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When the blocs not bid on are reintroduced and all three debaters blocs have been shown and either bid on or passed on the maximum bid for the reintroduced blocs go down 10 each time a new one is reintroduced and bid on. If there is a tie for a final position amongst tied players the person who secured their debaters bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.

Once the bids are received from the contestants for a particular round the contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all debaters in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their debaters blocs. The specialized slot machine can tabulate the scores for all of the debaters blocs. Once the specialized slot machine tabulates final scores for individual debaters blocs the specialized slot machine can add the scores together for debaters blocs belonging to the same contestant. The contestants can then be ranked 1 3 one through three on the specialized slot machine display screen. For example to tabulate the score of a single debater three components of information are required. First the debater s raw score is retrieved from a polling source. The second component of information needed is the bid with which the debater was secured. Finally the multiplier on the debater is factored in. Let s assume Hillary Clinton has a debate approval rating of 81 when the bidding process ends. This gives her a raw score of 81 points. Then assume she is secured with a 68 bid and the multiplier on her is 3 . Because 68 of 81 is 55.08 and when 55.08 is multiplied by 3 the result is 165.24. This means that Clinton s score is 165.24 and would either be a standalone score for a contestant or added to the other debater scores in that contestant s bloc. Finally tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc during the later round the higher finishing spot in the final standings.

Some groups of three contestants will have scores based on live data from the debate when it is just beginning and some when it is about to finish. But this characteristic of real time live event competition just adds another exciting element into the equation. It is important to remember that all contestants in a given group can bid on debaters blocs that are at the same juncture in their real time live action debate. The prepared contestant is going to have an idea how the action in the debate is unfolding to make a more educated bid during the bidding process. Again how debaters are valued at any given time is no different than the fluctuations of the stock market. This feature is exactly why real time live action play redefines what slot play is all about.

In various example embodiments described below real time live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine. These example embodiments use real life events to transform the specialized slot machine from a static entity that is currently based solely on canned information into a real time live event gaming apparatus.

As described above the real time live action events of the example embodiments constitute the gaming material itself. This specialized slot machine and the particular tournament formats of the various example embodiments described herein are based on real time live event data. In other words the decisions the players are making with the game itself are based on events that are happening at the time the game is being played.

This real time live event slot idea can be used for all types of real life events. For the purposes of this example embodiment the described example embodiment uses the specialized slot machine with real time live current trending on Twitter events or topics to create a new type of specialized slot machine.

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure for current trending on Twitter events in an example embodiment 

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first bloc of trending on Twitter topics that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the trending on Twitter topics that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 . However this strategy would be counter productive and would virtually guarantee that the contestant would come in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. The bid not only secures the bloc of trending on Twitter topics by having the lowest bid but the bid also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example a 1 bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the trending on Twitter topics that they desire but this bid also represents the percentage of raw points from each trending on Twitter topic that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example if a contestant bids 1 to win the trending on Twitter topics that they desire which hypothetically might consist of President Obama s Dog The New Star Wars Movie and The Royals Just Won the World Series the contestant will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1 of the raw points that each of these categories tallied. As a result a value of the contestant s bid as represented by the percentage bid is used to discount or reduce the contestant s score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.

In the example embodiment two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below 

Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above one might think that the game is unfair if some trending on Twitter topics might have as low as a 6 multiplier while others might be as high as a 10 multiplier However this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. Now contestants will have to factor into the calculus the fact that a trending on Twitter topic might be diminished in value because it has a smaller multiplier and a less desirable trending on Twitter topic is now more valued because of a higher multiplier. Even if a highly sought after trending on Twitter topic has a 10 multiplier this won t be a problem because it will drive the percentage bid lower to even things out. Conversely a less desirable trending on Twitter topic with a small multiplier should be able to be secured with a bid considerably higher than the norm.

In the example embodiment as described somebody is going to eventually get a bloc because there are no backup trending on Twitter topic blocs available and everybody is going to eventually need a bloc. All blocs not bid on are called mulligans and will be reintroduced after all the blocs have been revealed. If there is more than one bloc for which a bid is not received the blocs are reintroduced in the order that they first appeared. Also the maximum bid for a new round does not go down 8 if the previous bloc was a mulligan. When the blocs not bid on are reintroduced and all six blocs have been shown and either bid on or passed on the maximum bid for the reintroduced blocs go down 8 each time a new one is reintroduced and bid on. If there is a tie for a final position amongst tied players the person who secured their bloc in the lowest or latest round advances.

Once the bids are received from the contestants for a particular round the contestants in the group are scored for final positions. The specialized slot machine of an example embodiment can gather the data for all trending on Twitter topics in the contest and then compute the final positions. This computation will take no more than five seconds after all contestants have secured their blocs. The specialized slot machine will tabulate the scores for all of the trending on Twitter topics. Once the specialized slot machine tabulates final scores for individual trending on Twitter topics the specialized slot machine can add the scores together for blocs of trending on Twitter topics belonging to the same contestant. The contestants will then be ranked 1 6 one through six on the specialized slot machine display screen. For example to tabulate the score of a single trending on Twitter topic three components of information are required. First the trending on Twitter topic s raw score is calculated. The second component of information needed is the bid with which that the trending on Twitter topic was secured. Finally the multiplier on the trending on Twitter topic is factored in. Let s assume JLo is Getting Divorced Again has a 5.2 of the top 18 topics trending on Twitter when the bidding process ends. This gives the trending on Twitter topic a raw score of 5.2 points. Then assume this trending on Twitter topic is secured with a 68 bid and the multiplier on it is 5 . Because 68 of 5.2 is 3.5 and when 3.5 is multiplied by 5 the result is 17.5. This means that the JLo trending on Twitter topic has an overall score of 17.5 points and would be added to the scores of their other two trending on Twitter topics from their bloc. Finally tied positions always are broken by awarding the person who secured their bloc during the later round the higher finishing spot in the final standings.

In various example embodiments described herein two gaming formats have been blended together. One format involves the daily fantasy sports games that are immensely popular and the other format exploits their popularity by combining them with a skill based national tournament.

In an example embodiment there are seven essential gaming features required for a skill based national tournament to operate effectively. These features are described in more detail below. The goal of the combined gaming format provided by the specialized slot machine of an example embodiment is to balance two competing factors. One factor calls for maximizing the number of people who can play which is what companies want to increase profits. The other factor works in the exact opposite direction by seeking to limit participation which is what contestants want to enhance their chances to demonstrate their skill level.

The format and features of the combined gaming format provided by the specialized slot machine of an example embodiment are described in more detail next.

The combined gaming format described above for an example embodiment guarantees a minimum of 23 share of the entry fee revenue to the house e.g. the lottery provider for daily games. This is much better than the 10 that most companies e.g. lottery providers take for daily games. However this percentage dramatically increases if players opt to keep playing. Additionally the percentage take for the lottery provider is always the same for whatever the entry fee is. The two tables below one for a 50 entry fee and one for a 1 entry fee illustrate this point.

As shown in the tables above this group format of an example embodiment guarantees a minimum of 23 to the lottery for each group of 12 players. In this group format of an example embodiment the ratios work the same for any entry fee. For all group play the returns immediately jump to 45.6 to the lottery if a given player lets their winnings ride one time by playing in a round two group. Each time a player decides to let it ride into another round the lottery makes significantly more money see the Lottery Gets column in Tables 1 and 2. It is essential to create incentives to continue playing. In the group gaming format described herein in an example embodiment there are at least two incentives created to encourage contestant s to keep playing. Firstly players keep doubling their money each time they advance. Secondly players who advance ten consecutive rounds receive automatic berths in a big money TOC.

Contestants at their local lottery terminal can select six athletes for their lineup. For purposes of the example embodiment described herein we will use fantasy football as an example. However the group gaming format of the described embodiments can work for all sports. The required positions to fill out for a fantasy football lineup are one QB two RBs two WRs and one TE. If a contestant only wants to play one round their lineup will be printed on a lottery ticket with Rd 1 on it as well as a game number so the contestant can go to the lottery s website to identify their group of 12 players against whom they are playing. The contestants are also able to check their lineup against the other eleven people they are playing in their group. If a contestant wants to play more than one consecutive round there is an exact process for lineup submissions for these situations. Firstly they can t submit the same lineup for more than one round. The reason for this is because if a contestant hits with six athletes that have fantastic games then the contestant has a chance to quickly advance ten consecutive rounds with one hot lineup which is not desirable for the lottery holding the contest. At the same time contestants are not allowed to sit at the lottery terminal and select entire new lineups for each new round of consecutive play. This would keep contestants at the lottery terminal for too long of a time period.

The 33 Solution In an example embodiment the lottery game format allows contestants to print lineups for several consecutive rounds up to 10 in a very quick and timely manner. The format requires contestants to always change one third of their lineup for every new round while also requiring them to keep the other two thirds of their lineup exactly the same as it was for the previous round. To save even more time contestants are not allowed to decide what two lineup positions they want to swap athletes out for. The lottery will determine these positions that are to be changed to keep the contestant focused on only two positions instead of a possible six for swap outs. Contestants who opt to play multiple consecutive rounds will see the following lineup submission process on their lottery terminal beginning with Round 2 

For the football format the lineup parameters that a contestant follows in an example embodiment are set forth below. The contestant follows through a progression that is based on the quantity of consecutive rounds for which the contestant originally signed up to play.

It is important to note that in an example embodiment once an athlete completes their cycle for a contestant the athlete cannot be used again for rounds later on. Athletes can only be used one time per entry.

In an example embodiment the lottery game can close on a Sunday morning right before kickoff of the first Sunday morning game. The final results are tabulated and dispersed on each participating lottery s website at the conclusion of the Sunday night game. Monday night games as well as all other non Sunday games are ineligible for athlete selection purposes. The rationale for this is to have everything finalized by Sunday night so contestants are buying new lottery tickets on Monday instead of what might happen in their Monday night game.

It is important to understand that once the Sunday night game has finished all of the statistics are done. There are no more games to play. The way a contestant who signed up for three consecutive rounds finds out how they did is that the contestant can go to their Round 1 game on the website of the state lottery page where they purchased their ticket. The number on the ticket identifies their game number. They will then check the final standings for their group of twelve contestants. If they finished in the top four they will be given another game number to check their Round 2 results. If they again finish in the top four they receive a third game number that directs them to their 3round game. If they finished in the top four for this 3round match they cash out at this point because they signed up for three consecutive rounds. If they entered for 20 they would leave with 160 because 20 doubled is 40 for Rd 1 and 40 doubled again is 80 for Rd 2 and 80 doubled a third time is 160 for Rd 3 .

The Sunday night statistics are final no matter what happens later in the week. Occasionally the NFL changes statistics during the following week after looking at film. For example a pass completion might be changed to a run because the film showed what initially looked like a pass was changed to a lateral. These types of changes will not be considered relevant. It is not in the lottery s best interest to have entire scenarios recalibrated and have people who thought they won on Sunday night find out they lost on Tuesday morning.

Finally most fantasy sports enthusiasts prefer to have multiple entries in tournaments. The idea is to get them off of the terminal as quickly as possible so the next contestant can get on it. Instead of requiring someone to start all over again to create another entry the lottery terminal will ask the contestant how many entries they wish to have their submission count for. For example someone might choose to play a 5 per entry competition and designate they will play for seven consecutive rounds. Once they have created their seven lineups outlined by the process above they can then designate how many entries they want from this product they created. If they choose six entries for example then they would pay 30 5 per entry multiplied by the six times they want to enter and this progression of seven lineups is then entered in six unique first round groups with each one having a separate entry number to track. All of this information is printed on their ticket.

The following description provides a general overview of the scoring process for a twelve person group play tournament structure in an example embodiment. For the purpose of illustration the example embodiment is described as implemented for a fantasy football tournament. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein that other implementations can be supported as well. The format and rules for the qualifying rounds of the fantasy football tournament of the example embodiment are set forth below.

Fantasy players that tie for a top four position will use the following tiebreaker process in an example embodiment 

Below is a grid that shows what percentage of an NFL player s points a given fantasy participant receives depending on how many other competitors selected that NFL player.

The table below shows an example of the starting NFL players that a twelve person group selected. Note that there is no TE in this example. The percentage under each player s name represents the percentage that the fantasy player will get to keep of the actual fantasy points that their given NFL player scored for a particular week. This percentage is based on the number of times an NFL player was duplicated and is taken directly from the above table Table 4 .

Assume that a given NFL week has gone by and the Actual Fantasy Scores individual NFL players earned are then converted to their Adjusted Fantasy Score based on how many people selected them. Using the sample twelve player fantasy game set forth above i.e. Table 5 the Adjusted Fantasy Scores for the example are as follows 

Below are the final point totals for each of the twelve players competing in this hypothetical match of the example set forth above see Table 5 

In various example embodiments described below real time live events and related tournament formats are implemented on a specialized slot machine. These example embodiments use real life events to transform the specialized slot machine from a static entity that is currently based solely on canned information into a real time live event gaming apparatus.

As described above the real time live action events of the example embodiments constitute the gaming material itself. This specialized slot machine and the particular tournament formats of the various example embodiments described herein are based on real time live event data. In other words the decisions the players are making with the game itself are based on events that are happening at the time the game is being played.

This real time live event slot idea can be used for all types of real life events. For the purposes of this example embodiment the described example embodiment uses the specialized slot machine with real time live sporting events to create a new type of slot machine. Even more specifically the described example embodiment is used for a sports book format using fantasy sports by modifying some of the current ways fantasy sports games are played to enhance the real time live event slot machine embodiment as described herein. In an example embodiment the fantasy sports books application can be implemented as follows 

The following description provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine tournament structure for real time live action events with sports books in an example embodiment 

Why doesn t a contestant just bid 1 on the first team that they really like If the lowest bid wins this seems like a no brainer strategy that will automatically secure the team of athletes that they desire by submitting the lowest percentage which is 1 . However this strategy would be counter productive and would virtually guarantee them coming in last place. The reason for this is because the percentage bid serves two purposes. It not only secures the team of athletes by having the lowest bid but it also severely penalizes contestants for making unreasonably low bids. For example a 1 bid will undoubtedly win a contestant the team of athletes that they desire but this bid also represents the percentage of each athlete s fantasy points that they are eligible for in the game itself. For example if someone bids 1 to win a fantasy football group they desire such as Peyton Manning Calvin Johnson Larry Fitzgerald Marshawn Lynch Frank Gore and Vernon Wells they will be terribly disappointed to learn that they also only get 1 of the fantasy points that each of these six athletes scored in their respective games. As a result a value of the contestant s bid as represented by the percentage bid is used to discount or reduce the contestant s score or quantity of points received by a corresponding amount. In this manner a contestant bidding at a minimal level will also only receive a score or quantity of points at a correspondingly minimal level.

Given the description of the example embodiment as provided above one might think that the game is unfair if a team could potentially have six mediocre athletes on one side and six great athletes on another team However this feature of an example embodiment makes the game even more strategic. This feature actually turns the selection process into a riveting high wire exercise where skill becomes a major factor. Think of these teams of athletes as stocks. The more valuable the stock the more aggressive the bidding will be. The correct price will be set by the bids. A weak team at 95 of their fantasy points might be more valuable than a strong team at 12 of their fantasy points. This bidding process creates a tremendous amount of strategy for participants to consider.

In the example embodiment two additional rules heighten the drama of the tournament format implemented on the specialized slot machine. These additional rules are described below 

Some teams will have athlete statistics on live data from games that are almost over and some might be just starting. In other words contestants might show up at the specialized slot machine when all of the games are beginning and some when the games are ending. However this feature of the various adds another exciting element into the equation. It is important to remember that all contestants in a given group will bid on athletes that are at the same juncture in their real time live action games. The prepared contestant is going to have an idea how the action in various games is unfolding to make a more educated bid during the bidding process. Again how athletes are valued at any given time is no different than the fluctuations of the stock market. This feature is exactly why real time live action play redefines what slot play is all about.

The fantasy sports slot machine embodiments based on real time live action events as described herein provide a unique idea that has never been seen in the market. In these example embodiments the contestants themselves do not constitute the real time live action event s rather it is the game itself that uses real time live action events as the competition unfolds. These example embodiments fundamentally change the way slot machines are currently used. Slot machine players are suddenly playing with the outcomes that are based on events that are unfolding as they are playing. This adds a dimension to slot machines that has never been provided before.

In order to make these fantasy sports slot machine embodiments possible there are four key elements that are new to the fantasy sports genre that these embodiments introduce and that support the implementation. These four key elements include the following 

This betting line can also create betting situations other than for the winner and loser of a hypothetical sporting contest. An example embodiment can establish a betting line over or under the total fantasy points scored between the two teams in a hypothetical fantasy match one team in the contest or individual athletes or groups of athletes in that contest much like they do in real live sports betting. The big difference though is that all of the betting is based on fantasy points and hypothetical teams competing in fantasy sports contests.

Fantasy sports games have become a cultural phenomenon. People select their teams and then compete against other individuals. These hypothetical teams have become so real to people that in some cases they pull harder for their fantasy teams than their local hometown team.

If people are creating hypothetical or imaginary teams to play against other hypothetical teams why not have a betting line for these games too In other words one application of fantasy sports that hasn t emerged is a sports books format that mimics the sports betting on real life games. For example people might make a 200 bet that the San Francisco 49ers beat the N.Y. Jets in a football game as long as they get seven points. If the 49ers lose by 7 points or less or win outright the person who made the bet wins. If the 49ers lose by 8 or more points then the person who made the bet loses.

This betting format can apply directly to imaginary fantasy sports teams as well. A gaming institution using the fantasy sports book format as described herein could make up their own fantasy sports games that mimic real life games and support bets made on the fantasy sports games. For example an embodiment can be illustrated by an example below using two imaginary teams for a fantasy football game between the Spiders and the Steamrollers. The composition of these two example imaginary fantasy football teams is set forth below.

In an example embodiment and with the sample imaginary fantasy football teams set forth above assume the initial betting line for the game can be set by analyzing the sum of the average fantasy points. Let s assume in the example described herein that the average fantasy points for the two sample imaginary fantasy football teams set forth above are as follows 

Because the Spiders in this example have a sum total of 73.1 fantasy points per game average and the Steamrollers have a 70.2 fantasy points per game average a betting line can be established by using the difference which is 2.9 fantasy points to establish the original betting line. Because 2.9 rounds to 3 the initial betting line can be established in this example as follows 

This betting line can fluctuate based on other factors too. For example the betting line can fluctuate based on 1 the individual matchups the athletes have in their real life games and 2 the real life betting action that is happening on these matchups. In cases where an athlete is scratched at the last moment and doesn t play the scratched athlete could potentially create chaos. In these situations the athlete can be given their current seasonal average rounded to the nearest whole number as their fantasy point total for the match. If it is the first set up games for a season their average fantasy game score from the previous season can be used.

Finally betting lines for other elements of the imaginary fantasy sports game can also be offered. For example an over under for the total fantasy points these two teams combine for can be bet on. The over under for fantasy points for each team can be bet on. The over under for each athlete or group of athletes can be bet on. Other embodiments can similarly provide betting lines on a variety of aspects of the imaginary fantasy sports teams and the games they play.

There is an exciting way to package fantasy sports using state lotteries that will create great interest to fantasy sports enthusiasts. One of the great benefits a fantasy sports lottery has over a traditional lottery is the emotional attachment that participants have towards the athletes they select as they compete in their real life sporting events. This opportunity to openly root for athletes adds an additional element that traditional lotteries simply don t have.

To organize a fantasy sports lottery a couple of key barriers need to be addressed. Specifically there are three factors lottery organizers need to consider in order to implement a smooth running fantasy sports lottery. These factors include the following 

In order to package fantasy sports using state lotteries with a specialized fantasy sports slot machine there are three solutions provided by an example embodiment that are new to state lottery systems and the fantasy sports genre. These three key solutions include the following 

In order to combine fantasy sports features using state lotteries with a specialized fantasy sports slot machine there are processes provided by an example embodiment that are new to state lottery systems and the fantasy sports genre. These processes for the example embodiment are described below.

Contestants can have the option to either select their fantasy sports lineups themselves or have the specialized fantasy sports slot machine do it for them. The specialized fantasy sports slot machine can also allow contestants to submit multiple entries simultaneously by both methods described above.

The number of athletes the fantasy sports lottery format will require can be five six or another number depending on the sport. The fantasy sports lottery format can also select a power ball athlete. For some sports the athletes can be required to fit specific positions on the field. Football for example would require a selection process of exactly one QB two RB s two WR s one TE and one Flex e.g. the flex athlete can be any RB WR or TE who wasn t already selected for each entry. For other sports like baseball the contestant can be asked for each entry to pick six position ballplayers and one power ball without concern for position as long as the position is not a pitcher for the slugger s game and not a slugger for the pitcher s game .

Once contestants can no longer submit entries all lineups are then locked and the fantasy sports lottery system of an example embodiment can calibrate and determine the percentage of fantasy points each athlete will be worth in their game or series of games that encompasses the lottery timeframe. For example for the football lottery let s assume that one hour before kickoff in the first Sunday NFL football game no more entries can be submitted by contestants in the fantasy sports lottery. At that point contestants can go to a fantasy sports lottery website to see what percentage each athlete is worth. Moreover during this one hour time period before the first kickoff the bonus athletes can be drawn and their new percentages can be displayed too.

Lottery players often like to play different types of games. A fun variation in an alternative embodiment is a Fantasy Eliminator game. This is a game where contestants have to stay in the top 50 tier or they are eliminated as the real life fantasy contests are progressing. To illustrate the operation of this game format an example embodiment is described below with football as the example fantasy sports game.

Assume there are separate Fantasy Eliminator games for both the AM early and PM late Sunday NFL games. Let s choose the AM early games for the purposes of this example. The selection process would follow all of the rules already described above for the general game format. That is contestants would select their athletes the duplication penalties would be calculated by the fantasy sports lottery system of an example embodiment and then the bonus athletes would be announced and their updated percentages added to the mix.

The Fantasy Eliminator game would begin with a timing mechanism that starts with the kickoff of the last morning early NFL football game. Once this happens every ten minutes or other pre determined time period that goes by the bottom 50 of the field is eliminated. This process continues with the clock running and 50 of the field eliminated every ten minutes or other pre determined time period . The only time this clock stops is when every single game is on a halftime break at the same time and there is no NFL action from any of the morning early games. If this never happens the clock will never stop until the last morning early game is complete. The clock resumes during situations when all games are in halftime the moment one of the contests resumes its third quarter action.

A typical NFL football contest runs for about three hours. Assuming there will be a ten minute interval where no games are going on during the approximate halftime time slot this leaves approximately 17 ten minute intervals during the course of the morning early games. Let s assume 5 million people signed up to play the Fantasy Eliminator game. The table below shows how the field would pare down according to the rules of the game 

If the game ended after interval 17 then the final 38 contestants would be ranked and given prizes according to where they were ranked. If at any time the number of contestants left is less than 20 then one contestant is eliminated every five minutes until there is only one left standing.

The time interval that is used to eliminate players can fluctuate depending on how many entries there are. The fewer entries there are the longer the time interval is to eliminate contestants. The more entries there are the shorter this eliminator time interval becomes. The correct time intervals can be pre programmed based on how many contestants there are in a given Fantasy Eliminator game.

In the example embodiment the following description illustrates the structure and rules for a fantasy sports scratcher game a 5 25 50 format . This game format can be used for any fantasy sport. The example embodiment provides a format and system wherein contestants can purchase scratchers with the names of athletes from a given fantasy sport that are hidden and waiting to be scratched off. The contestant will be guaranteed that each athlete will play in their game. If an athlete on a scratcher does not play in their game the athlete s fantasy point per game average can be used for their score.

Scoring systems can vary depending on the sport. In general the five athletes on a scratcher must score about 10 higher across the board on their fantasy points per game average to enable the contestant to get their money back. The object of the game is for the athletes on the scratcher to score a combined number of fantasy points that puts them in the winner s circle. The better the combined score of the athletes on the scratcher the more money the contestant can win. For example the sum of the athletes fantasy points for a particular game might warrant that the fantasy score for the five athletes is ten points higher than their seasonal average. If this happens the contestant would get their money back. The contestant would then be able to win higher increments of money depending on the combined total fantasy points of the athletes who are on the scratcher. The following table illustrates an example of how the process works in the example embodiment 

To illustrate the operation of the example embodiment assume that a scratcher has the following athletes with their point per game averages listed below 

The sum of the averages in the example set forth above is 55.9 which is about 56 points. The fantasy sports scratcher game of the example embodiment would require that the contestant needs to produce a scratcher with a combined score of 62 points 10 higher to get their money back 68 points for 5 their money 74 points for 25 their money and 80 points for 50 their money for this particular example.

In the example embodiment the structure and rules for a fantasy sports scratcher game can be implemented in a variety of ways. In a particular embodiment rules can be defined to structure the format and operation of the fantasy sports scratcher game. In the particular embodiment these rules can be defined as follows 

Rule 2 Contestants determine how much they want to play for. Entry points might be 1 5 10 20 50 and 100 for example.

Rule 3 The athletes names are hidden under the position slots on the scratcher. Contestants can scratch off each position to reveal the athlete that was randomly given to them.

Rule 4 Contestants will be guaranteed that each of their athletes will play in their game. If an athlete doesn t play e.g. including injury suspension or coach s decision in their game the athlete s fantasy point game average for the season or a prior season can be used.

In the example embodiment the structure and rules for a Tic Tac Toe scratcher game can be implemented in a variety of ways. In a particular embodiment rules can be defined to structure the format and operation of the Tic Tac Toe scratcher game. In the particular embodiment these rules can be defined as described below.

In the example embodiment contestants get a scratcher with nine athletes names printed on it in nine distinct spots on the scratcher see example below . Initially all of the names of the athletes on the scratcher are obscured. The athletes printed on the scratcher may all play the same position like the example below or the athletes may play different positions.

In the example embodiment contestants can scratch off a variable number of distinct spots on the scratcher to reveal the athletes names printed at the scratched spots. The number of scratched spots can correspond to a plurality of achievements accomplished by the contestant. These achievements in an example embodiment are described below.

Achievement 1 The contestant wins 2 twice the entry fee The contestant scratches off three spots that make three in a row. The other six spots are left unscratched. If the combined fantasy score of the athletes hits a pre determined benchmark about 15 more than their combined average the contestant wins 2 their entry fee.

Achievement 2 The contestant wins 4 four times the entry fee The contestant scratches off any six spots and leaves three unscratched. If the combined fantasy sport score of the six athletes at the scratched spots hits a pre determined benchmark about 20 more than their combined average the contestant wins 2 their entry fee. Achievement 1 is not in play for contestants who scratch off only six spots.

Achievement 3 The contestant wins 8 eight times the entry fee The contestant scratches off all nine spots. If all three in a row combinations of the combined fantasy sport score of the athletes at the scratched spots hits a pre determined benchmark about 10 more than their combined average the contestant wins 8 their entry fee. Achievements 1 and 2 are not in play for contestants who scratch off all nine spots.

Achievement 4 The contestant wins 16 sixteen times the entry fee The contestant scratches off all nine spots. If all three in a row combinations of the combined fantasy sport score of the athletes at the scratched spots hits a pre determined benchmark Achievement 3 and each of the four athletes outscore the middle athlete the contestant wins 16 their entry fee. Achievements 1 and 2 are not in play for contestants who scratch off all nine spots.

In the example embodiment athletes appearing on a scratcher must play in their game. If the athlete doesn t play then the point total they receive is exactly one third of what is needed to make the three in a row requirement. In the case of this example if 100 is the three in a row total then an athlete who didn t play is worth 33.3 points. This rule guarantees that suspended hurt or demoted athletes will still have a fair value.

In the example embodiment athletes appearing on a scratcher must start. If an athlete doesn t start for any reason then the athlete gets the better score between the one third requirement described above or the score the athlete actually scored. This rule guarantees contestants that they will get real starters for their scratchers.

In the example embodiment the structure and rules for a Two Touchdown scratcher game can be implemented in a variety of ways. In a particular embodiment rules can be defined to structure the format and operation of the Two Touchdown scratcher game. In the particular embodiment these rules can be defined as described below.

In the example embodiment the Two Touchdown scratcher game supports a game format that is not necessarily based on fantasy points. Not all sports games have to be based on fantasy points to create a fun offering. In the example embodiment there are two versions of this game. The formats of these two versions of the Two Touchdown scratcher game are described below. In the example embodiment all athletes on a given scratcher must appear in their respective games or the scratcher can be redeemed for a new play the following week. If it is the last week then the money is refunded.

In the example embodiment a luck based second chance game is described. For every team in the NFL for example there are some combinations in the scratcher game that can make contestants eligible for prizes at the end of the season. These combinations can have real life teammates appearing at the same time on the same scratchers. For example if a single scratcher had exactly two 49ers on it then the scratcher could be worth a 5 bonus at the end of the NFL playoffs. If the single scratcher had three 49ers on it then the scratcher might be worth a 100 bonus at the end of the NFL playoffs. If the single scratcher had four 49ers on it then the scratcher might be worth a 10 000 bonus at the end of the NFL playoffs. If the single scratcher had five 49ers on it then the scratcher might be worth a 100 000 bonus at the end of the NFL playoffs. If the single scratcher had six 49ers on it then the scratcher might be worth a million dollar bonus at the end of the NFL playoffs.

In the example embodiment a lottery administrator can pre determine the number of winning tickets the lottery administrator will distribute for each level of common teammates. For example there might be five million dollar winners for having six common teammates 20 100 000 winners for five common teammates etc. The way the lottery administrator would do this is by printing exactly five one million dollar tickets with six 49ers on it exactly 20 100 000 tickets with five 49ers on it etc.

The lottery administrator can then print these combinations as described above for the 49ers for every NFL team. The lottery administrator can also print the same number of potential winning scratchers for each level in the increments as described above for the 49ers. Contestants would be inclined to save any scratcher ticket they got with common teammates because these scratchers might be worth something at the end of the season. Ultimately only the scratchers with combinations featuring the Super Bowl winning team at the end of the year will have any meaning. The Super Bowl winning team at the end of the year automatically pays off for these amounts for each ticket at the combination level for which they are good. Again all other combination tickets with common teammates are rendered meaningless.

During the regular season there will be 32 teams worth of all of these combinations so a lot of people will initially be hopeful. There would actually be 160 possible million dollar winners since five for each team 32 total NFL teams 160 possible million dollar winners. There would be 640 possible 100K winners during the NFL season in this example embodiment.

Once the playoffs begin only 12 teams get into the playoffs. This means that the 20 teams that didn t get into the playoffs now all have worthless multiple player combinations on the same team. The drama builds each week as people hope their multiple combination scratchers are still good as NFL teams advance or get eliminated. Once an NFL team is eliminated the combinations the team represents will be worthless in terms of winning money for contestants. Again only the Super Bowl winning combination is a winner for all combinations of two three four five and six athletes on the same team. There might be approx. 30 000 total 5 winners with two common athletes on the scratcher of the Super Bowl winning team 1 000 total 100 winners with three common athletes 100 total 10 000 winners with four common athletes 20 total 100 000 winners with five common athletes and five total 1 000 000 winners with six common athletes.

Casinos and other gaming venues have an opportunity to enter the exploding fantasy sports market via traditional slot machines that are designed to create games of intense skill based strategy. The specialized fantasy sports slot machine such as the example embodiments described herein implements games of skill that feature live players competing against one another. The entire game is designed to involve skill because variables involving luck are eliminated. This concept becomes possible because the data used is solely based on known statistics and not live action scoring where all kinds of variables get introduced. The disclosure herein provides a general overview of the specialized slot machine in an example embodiment.

In various embodiments described herein slot machines for conducting wagering games using real time or live action event content via a computer system and or a data network are disclosed. In general this patent application relates to computer or network implemented gaming systems and or fantasy sports tournaments. Fantasy sports is a competitive gaming structure where participants pick real life professional or amateur athletes to fill out a personalized team. They then use this lineup or roster that they picked to compete against teams selected by other fantasy players by comparing the accumulated statistics earned of their respective athletes. This patent application describes various embodiments of computer and network implemented systems and processes providing a tournament structure for fantasy sports that has never been on the market. One reason it hasn t been available before is because the systems and methods that it uses are counter intuitive to what fantasy players are accustomed. At the same time these new strategies address a tremendous need in the industry.

Athlete A professional or amateur athlete that is selected from a real life sports team to represent a fantasy player s team for a fantasy game.

Actual Fantasy Points The fantasy points an athlete accumulates from their real life athletic competition.

Adjusted Fantasy Points A process for deducting or increasing an athlete s fantasy points based on potential bonuses and deductions.

Blind Submission Process A process where fantasy players attempt to secure athletes for their fantasy teams by putting in their requests without knowing what their opponents requested.

Bonus Fantasy Points Additional fantasy points that are awarded up and beyond what an athlete actually scores in their real life athletic competition. This happens when multipliers are introduced for prioritizing a given athlete over others.

Caps The process of creating an upper bound it can be extremely high for the number of fantasy players that can participate in a given qualifying tournament. It is essential to coordinate the upper bounds of all the qualifying tournaments with each other so that the fixed number of seats in the Main Event tournament is not exceeded.

Contingency Lineup When a fantasy player is required to submit a second lineup or possibly more from games later in the day. This second lineup is contingent upon them advancing from proceedings that happened using the first lineup or prior lineup . The reason a contingency lineup is needed is because there is not enough time to submit a new lineup after the fantasy player advanced to the next round.

Draft Room Place where fantasy players get together to draft athletes. This concept can be extended to a virtual draft room where fantasy players meet via the Internet and select athletes using their computers.

Duplication of Athletes Occurs when two or more fantasy players select the same athlete via a blind submission process for their respective lineups.

Fantasy Game A game with rules that is played between two or more fantasy players to see who accumulates the better fantasy score from accumulated statistics of athletes from live sporting events.

Fantasy Points What an athlete accrues based on performing positive actions in their real life athletic competition.

Fantasy Tournament A tournament format where fantasy players compete against each other to see who emerges as the winner.

Group Three or more fantasy players placed together to compete against each other at the same time for a given match.

Group Play This format is used for tournaments with groups of three or more fantasy players competing against each other at the same time. A predetermined number of top finishers advance to the next round for each group involved.

Head to Head Method When two fantasy players are paired against each other in a fantasy match. This is one of the two formats that is currently used in tournament play. The other is the lottery style of play.

Holy Grail Tournament The applicant s ideal fantasy sports tournament that is currently not on the market. The format has three primary components in it that are required to appeal to the masses. First the entry fees are nominal to make it affordable to the masses. Secondly the grand prize is in the millions of dollars to attract the masses. Finally the tournament format does not require fantasy players to simultaneously play against the entire field. No fantasy sports tournament has ever been introduced to the market with at least these three important features.

League Where eight usually no less to twenty usually no more fantasy players form a league and select athletes to compete against each other in head to head matches. Won Lost records are recorded and the better records are rewarded at the end of the season by making the playoffs and competing for the championship.

Lineup Submissions The process where fantasy players submit the names of the athletes that they want to represent them for a fantasy match. This process can either be a one time submission or happen over several rounds of submissions.

Locked In A term that is used to represent an athlete has been submitted and accepted into the lineup of a fantasy player competing in a head to head match.

Lottery Method Tournament format where fantasy players are required to compete against the entire field simultaneously. This is one of the two formats that is currently used in tournament play. The other is the head to head style of play.

Main Tournament This is the portion of a Holy Grail tournament where the qualifying tournament winners meet to determine an overall champion.

Penalties for Duplication Point penalties that occur when the same athlete is selected by two or more fantasy players during a blind submission process.

Percentage Multiplier A number that represents the fraction of fantasy points that a fantasy player receives from their athlete s actual fantasy score based on duplication rules that are in place. This number is multiplied by an athlete s fantasy points to recalibrate their fantasy point total to give them their adjusted fantasy point total.

Qualifying Tournament A tournament that is held to qualify fantasy players for the Main Event tournament.

Re entry Format A type of Holy Grail tournament format that allows fantasy players that are eliminated in a given round to buy back into the tournament. This can be done in four different ways Players can either 1 immediately advance to the next round as if they weren t eliminated 2 return back to the round that they were eliminated 3 start over again in the same round they originally entered or 4 completely re enter under a different round structure.

RINGS RINGS is an acronym for Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size . The term and the related concepts as described herein can be used in fantasy sports tournaments of various embodiments and involve using small groups of fantasy contestants competing over two or more rounds of play.

Serpentine Draft Format A drafting format that snakes back up from bottom to top once everyone has drafted. This is used instead of starting back up at the beginning again. For example if four people are drafting then the drafting order would be player A player B player C player D player D again player C player B player A player A again player B etc. This is not a new concept to the fantasy sports industry.

Single Round Elimination Tournament A tournament structure where fantasy players are eliminated once they lose a round.

Slotted position The ranking or priority a fantasy player gives a given athlete for their lineup. This procedure is used for tournaments where fantasy players are asked to list the athletes they covet in order of preference.

Spacing Problems Happens when there aren t enough paths that have been created to allow unlimited numbers of fantasy players into a tournament. If the spacing problems are too severe tournaments are forced to operate using lottery effect rules where all the fantasy players have to compete against each other simultaneously.

Super Wild Card Format A format for conducting a fantasy sports tournament where more than one round is needed for a given live real world athletic competition or group of competitions that are running concurrently. This is not to be confused with a Wildcard Format where more than one round is needed during the same day.

Weighting Athletes A process for giving additional or higher fantasy point values to athletes that are slotted higher.

Wildcard Format A format for conducting a fantasy sports tournament where more than one round is needed for a given day. This is not to be confused with a Super Wildcard Format where more than one round is needed during the same game or games running concurrently .

Fantasy sports tournaments have never been able to create a process where an unlimited number of people can play without creating a lottery type of effect. A lottery effect is the very undesirable result of having so many fantasy players entered in a tournament that there is no longer enough room to have them play each other in head to head matchups. There are several reasons why the lottery effect continues to occur for tournaments that don t limit the number of entries. Primarily it is because of the strong sentiment for keeping with tradition. Fantasy tournament organizers are reluctant to alter the format of the way the game has traditionally been played. This mindset has definitely helped preserve tradition but it has come at a price. It has stifled creativity.

Tournament organizers have not been able to identify at least four key characteristics required for a Holy Grail type of fantasy sports tournament. The reason for this is because in order to develop this type of tournament there are several non obvious solutions for the features that have to be implemented. This is a two step process that makes it even more non obvious for someone to figure out. First it is necessary to minimally identify what these four features are and then just as importantly provide solutions so that these features can all appear together in the same tournament solutions that must incorporate outside the box thinking or the task becomes unwieldy. The various embodiments as described herein provide these features and solutions.

There are at least four key features that should be in the same tournament structure to produce an effective tournament. These features include the following 1 entry fees must be a nominal e.g. low cost low risk for the consumer cost to the consumer so the masses can afford to play 2 the grand prize must be a multi million dollar grand prize it has to be life changing money where the winner minimally becomes a millionaire after taxes so the masses will enthusiastically desire to play 3 participants must not be subjected to playing the entire field or large numbers of contestants at the same time to discourage the masses skill must always be a factor in the tournament and 4 there must be a re entry component that allows fantasy players an option to continue getting back into the tournament for as long as possible.

Low entry fee A tournament with a large prize pool must attract the masses or it is doomed. Tournament organizers would much rather have 5 million people pay 1 and generate 5 million dollars as opposed to 50 000 people paying 100 and generating 5 million dollars. There is a much higher probability that more people will pay a lower cost buy in. The key concept here is that a low risk entry point for the consumer especially for a chance at a high reward like a multi million dollar prize is always more successful than a high risk entry point even if the reward is something much higher like 10 million dollars. In an example embodiment the low risk entry point for the consumer can be considered to be a buy in of less than or equal to 50 per fantasy player or per entry. In another example embodiment the low risk entry point for the consumer can be considered to be a buy in of less than or equal to 5 per fantasy player or per entry.

A Multi Million dollar Grand Prize A multi million dollar grand prize guarantees that the winner will have tremendous incentive to play especially since the buy in cost is so low. This type of opportunity creates a frenzied climate where people start believing they have to get into the tournament especially if the risk is low as provided by the low cost buy in of the first element of the tournament format described herein.

Group Play Tournaments that enable fantasy players of a fantasy sports tournament to be partitioned into a plurality of player groups thereby enabling competition in small groups where fantasy players are allowed to advance to the next round create more entries and more value because contestants have the belief they have a chance to advance to the next round. Conversely forcing fantasy players to simultaneously beat the entire field which could be millions of people is suffocating because people won t believe they can advance so they won t enter. This is deadly for a tournament that has to cover a multi million dollar prize pool with low cost e.g. 5 entries.

Re Entry Component The only way that a tournament that charges low cost e.g. 5 entry fees for a chance to win a multi million dollar grand prize can be successful is if people continue to circulate back into the tournament if they get knocked out. People are much more willing to spend 200 on tournament entry fees if the fees are paid in increments of 5 and 10 dollars over a two or three month time span as opposed to a one time up front payment. If there is no re entry component a potential 200 customer only gets one chance to spend 5. This is a recipe to render a high stakes fantasy sports tournament insolvent very quickly.

In the various embodiments described herein a re entry component only has meaning when a tournament has a progression of rounds so that players can either immediately advance to the next round as if they weren t eliminated return back to the round that they were eliminated start over again in the same position they originally entered or completely re enter under a different round structure. The FanDuel tournament is a good example to illustrate what is NOT a re entry format. FanDuel has 24 different one round qualifying tournaments that they use for people to get into their Main Event. This would not be considered a re entry type of tournament because it doesn t have a progression of rounds.

Creating a Spacing Mechanism The inability to create a spacing mechanism that allows millions of people to play in a fantasy sports tournament while not subjecting them to a Lottery Effect has been a significant roadblock to holding an effective tournament for the fantasy sports industry. The embodiments described herein create a spacing mechanism that now makes it possible to hold fantasy sports tournaments where people can enter for a low cost entry fee e.g. under 100 or even less than 5 and win a high value e.g. multi million dollar grand prize. There are two important features that the embodiments described herein provide to allow this spacing to happen in a sports fantasy tournament. These features are 1 group play within a tournament and 2 advancing instead of winning. These features are described below.

The feature of group play within a tournament No other fantasy sports tournament in existence uses group play as a matter of fact group play doesn t exist for any fantasy sports contests tournament or no tournament . Yet group play is the only way to create the spacing that allows a low entry fee while at the same time not forcing fantasy players to compete against the entire field simultaneously. The reason for this is that group play allows tournament organizers to create ratios other than the standard 2 1 ratio where one person advances per two people playing. Nobody has ever introduced a group play format for fantasy tournaments.

The feature of advancing instead of winning Meeting a minimum threshold to advance as opposed to having to win to advance is an important feature that no other tournament format uses to create the right ratios for spacing. Group play allows participants the opportunity to advance without necessarily having to win to move on in a tournament. For example a group of 12 can permit the top 3 players to advance.

A high stakes fantasy sports tournament involving millions of players cannot operate using a traditional draft. It simply takes too long which is lethal for what is needed to make the tournament successful. Long drawn out drafts means fantasy players won t have the time to purchase multiple entries. Multiple entries are an important element to support this type of tournament format. There is no way a tournament that charges a nominal entry fee and awards a multi million dollar grand prize can survive unless a large number of players are buying multiple entries. This makes it important to eliminate traditional drafts. The high stakes fantasy sports tournament format described herein can eliminate the need for a traditional draft. There are five features listed below that are employed in various embodiments described herein to eliminate traditional drafts. Each of these features involve a blind submission process where the participants in a group or match play event don t know what their opponents have submitted

Duplication Penalties Feature In an example embodiment fantasy players are penalized points e.g. the players point totals are reduced from their athletes actual fantasy points earned based on how many other fantasy players in their group selected that athlete. For example if a fantasy player is the only one to select a particular athlete that fantasy player gets the particular athlete at 100 of the athlete s fantasy point value. However if three other fantasy players in the group also submit select that particular athlete the three other fantasy players in the group would all get that particular athlete for their lineup but each of the three fantasy players may only get 75 or some other percentage less than 100 of the actual fantasy points earned by the particular athlete.

Multipliers Feature Athletes are selected based on desirability. The higher a fantasy player values the athlete the higher the multiplier is for their fantasy points. If there are five athletes selected the first slotted athlete might get five times their fantasy points the second slotted athlete might get four times their fantasy points etc.

Feature for Slotting Athletes on a Percentage Continuum Athletes can be selected and slotted on a scale ranging from any percentages that a tournament organizer decides. For example the first slot can be for 100 the second slot can be for 85 the third slot for 70 etc. This allows fantasy players to select the same athletes but the fantasy players might have their athletes valued at different percentages.

Feature for Disqualifying Athletes that are Duplicated Disqualifying athletes that are duplicated is an especially effective feature in head to head matches. If both fantasy players in a match submit the same athlete that athlete is disqualified and cannot be resubmitted.

Blind Percentage Bid Feature Fantasy players are required to not only submit an athlete but also a bid specifying a percentage of their fantasy points they will get for the match. For cases when both fantasy players select the same athlete the bid is used by the example embodiment to decide who gets the athlete. The fantasy player who bids the lower percentage of fantasy points gets the athlete. For example if fantasy player A is willing to take a given athlete at 73 of their fantasy points and fantasy player B is only willing to take the given athlete at 98 of their fantasy points then fantasy player A would receive this athlete but would only receive 73 percent of the fantasy points that athlete scored in the match. If both fantasy players bid the same percentage nobody would get that athlete.

Specific Re entry Strategies of an Example Embodiment The only way that a high stakes fantasy sports tournament can charge a nominal buy in fee and offer a high value grand prize is if there is a re entry component that allows fantasy players an option to continue getting back into the tournament for as long as possible. The various embodiments described herein provide at least two re entry features that have never been used before. These re entry features are described below.

Re entry Feature for Paying More Money to Play Fewer Rounds When a fantasy player is eliminated and their opponent moves on it would be inherently unfair to let the loser back in unless a fair accommodation was made. One method for letting somebody back in is to create another qualifying option that has fewer rounds because there isn t as much time left until the tournament concludes but charges the person a re entry fee that is at a higher cost level than their opponent had to pay for their entry. For example a fantasy player might only pay 5 to play in a 10 round qualifier and another fantasy player might pay 500 to play in a three round qualifier.

Re entry Feature for Creating New Qualifiers with the Same Number of Rounds This feature allows a fantasy player to continue playing in a new qualifier but creates new paths to duplicate the same number of rounds that fantasy players who are still playing are required to play. This process is not as simple as it may sound but the capability is highly desirable because it allows people to re enter at very low prices and retains the fairness of the tournament. To create the new paths an example embodiment can hold multiple rounds in the same day or even multiple rounds in the same game. This is because the qualifying tournament sometimes has only one day to duplicate the many rounds that another player took many weeks to complete. The various embodiments create new qualifiers to duplicate the same number of rounds by manipulating a smaller time period to create the same number of rounds thereby enabling the re entry price to remain fixed.

Creating a Format for Condensed Seasons and Events Many real life sporting seasons and events are so condensed that the only way to hold a viable high stakes fantasy tournament is to hold two or more rounds on the same day. For example it is difficult to hold a high stakes fantasy tournament for the Olympics World Cup of Soccer or even the NFL playoffs where millions of fantasy players can play for a low entry fee win a high value prize and still play in groups. The various embodiments described herein provide a format that supports these condensed seasons and events. At least two features provided by an example embodiment enable these types of tournaments to be feasible. These features are described below.

Feature for Contingency Lineups Fantasy players must submit two or more lineups during the same day for events that are happening throughout the day. Any lineup other than the initial one is a contingency lineup and only goes into effect if that fantasy player has advanced to the round where the contingency lineup becomes relevant.

Feature for Group Play throughout the tournament In most cases it is desirable to hold qualifying tournaments that involve group play to qualify fantasy players for the main tournament. During the main tournament because there will be a fewer number of players the tournament format can revert to the more traditional match play where fantasy players compete against a single opponent. Sometimes it is simply not possibly to have any match play e.g. head to head play because the time frame is so short like the Olympic Games . In cases like these the feature for group play between fantasy players as described herein is used exclusively for these condensed tournaments so that the tournaments still can have the four essential ingredients that a thriving fantasy sports tournament must have as described herein.

The various embodiments as described herein provide the systems and methods solutions required for a fantasy sports machine or program that allows an unlimited number of fantasy players to enter a fantasy sports tournament without requiring them to play the entire field at the same time. The various embodiments as described herein are not tied to a particular fantasy sports game. Rather the various embodiments provide a how to guide for the features required to create a tournament format that is not currently available on the market. Before going into detail some background information is helpful to understand some key practices that have created barriers for this new type of format.

Fantasy sports has become a multi billion dollar industry that continues to grow exponentially. Emerging from this incredible growth has been a culture that has created certain expectations for how a fantasy tournament should look. Unfortunately these expectations have not always been conducive for progress and have actually hindered the development of new types of formats. Factors that have contributed to this mindset and impeded progress include the common practices beliefs and expectations that are described below.

Once such common practice is the practice of fantasy players competing against each other in a head to head format whenever possible. This is a by product of how real life sports teams compete. The reasoning seems to be that you don t see three football teams competing against each other in the same game therefore you shouldn t have three fantasy players competing against each other in the same fantasy match. The only exception to this rule occurs when lottery type of tournaments are played. During lottery tournaments fantasy players are strictly vying for the high point total often against millions of others over the course of a given time period which means they are all playing each other at the same time a very discouraging method of competing.

Other factors impeding progress include the tendency of fantasy tournament organizers to preserve the tradition of league play within the tournament structure. League play is where anywhere from eight to twenty fantasy players form a league to compete head to head in order to determine which person has the best overall record. This is an extremely entertaining format but it is a disaster for fantasy tournaments that seek to crown an overall champion. The problem is that once leagues are formed inferior fantasy players are kept in the tournament far too long which creates spacing problems.

Another factor is the reluctance to eliminate fantasy competitors early on in the tournament even when they are doing poorly. As a general rule fantasy players consider fantasy sports to be an entertainment outlet for the entire season. Early elimination from a tournament runs counter to this fundamental expectation.

Another factor is the practice of fantasy players exclusively owning their athletes. Once again this mirrors how the real world of sports works. You don t see more than one team in real life sports share ownership of the same athlete so the reasoning is that it shouldn t happen in fantasy games either. The only exception in the fantasy arena once again is with lottery style tournaments where the sharing of athletes is permitted out of necessity. This is due to the fact that there are not enough athletes to go around when the entire field of competitors are simultaneously playing one another. However even though lottery tournaments allow sharing they still don t have a system in place that penalizes fantasy players for duplicating athletes.

Another factor is the limited strategy inherent in submitting lineups in conventional tournament formats. In standard formats what one fantasy player submits has no bearing on what their opponent submits in terms of potential bonuses or penalties. This creates a relatively stress free process but may also create inefficiencies.

Another factor is the inability of many fantasy enthusiasts to differentiate between the actual fantasy games that have created a cultural phenomenon and frankly don t need to be changed and separate them from the flawed tournament structures that need an overhaul.

The solutions to address these barriers are not obvious. Some of them run counter to deeply entrenched beliefs on how fantasy sports games should be played. If they were obvious people would be holding Holy Grail tournaments using the format described herein. There would be scores of tournaments where competitors could enter for a 5 entry fee win a multi million dollar grand prize not be subjected to the daunting parameters of having to compete against the entire field at the same time and also have an opportunity to re enter the tournament without creating a competitive disadvantage for any of the players. However in currently used tournament formats the opposite of this is true. There isn t a single tournament on the market that has all of these features.

It is difficult to quantify how big this void is in the fantasy sports industry by not having a Holy Grail tournament structure. In many respects the lack of an effective tournament format has been devastating for the industry. There has been so much interest in fantasy sports events but current structures have not been an effective vehicle for delivering an all comers tournament.

In the various embodiments described herein there are at least four features that when combined together create a fantasy sports tournament that can attract the masses. These features include the following 1 a low entry fee buy in 2 a multi million dollar grand prize 3 participants must not be subjected to playing the entire field or large numbers of contestants at the same time to discourage the masses and 4 a re entry component.

In the previous section six common practices were discussed that have impeded the progress for a Holy Grail tournament as described herein. Each of these common practices along with their non obvious solution s is described in more detail below. It is important to note that these solutions don t have to appear in a particular order. Not all of them even need to be present to operate a successful Holy Grail tournament although the more solutions that are incorporated into the tournament structure the more effective the tournament will be.

A first common practice in traditional tournament structures is the practice of fantasy players exclusively competing against each other in either head to head or lottery type formats. The various embodiments described herein provide a non obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. In an example embodiment fantasy players compete in small player groups of three or more in the same match. This feature of the example embodiment runs counter to what fantasy players think should happen. Fantasy players are used to their sports teams competing head to head so they expect the same from their fantasy matchups. As implemented in the example embodiment a group is not the same as a league. A player group is defined as a small cluster of fantasy players who are put together to compete against one another in a single match. Leagues have groups of fantasy players competing against one another in head to head matches. This format only allows two fantasy players to compete against each another at the same time. For the purposes of this patent disclosure a group is defined as three or more fantasy players who compete against each another at the same time. This format of the example embodiment with groups of three or more creates much needed spacing that allows more fantasy players to enter without subjecting them to the Lottery Effect.

A second common practice in traditional tournament structures is the tendency of fantasy tournament organizers to preserve the tradition of league play within the tournament structure. The various embodiments described herein provide a non obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. In an example embodiment a solution is implemented to eliminate the under performing participants in a consistent and timely manner. In an effective tournament structure it is simply not possible to keep low performing fantasy players in a tournament that looks to crown an overall champion especially when there are millions of entries in the tournament. It creates a spacing nightmare because nobody goes away until it is too late. There is no way to whittle millions of fantasy players down to one overall champion if the tournament format doesn t eliminate the participants in a consistent and timely manner. Current formats tend to start their elimination process way too late in the tournament. In one embodiment a solution paradigm is to create single elimination fantasy sports tournaments. This format requires fantasy players to meet a minimum expectation for every round in which they play or they are immediately eliminated. It doesn t matter if it is the first round the last round or any round in between. The expectation might be that they have to beat a single opponent in a head to head format or the expectation might be that they have to finish in the top four of their player group to advance. Whatever it is there has to be a minimum expectation to remain in for every round. A single elimination type of format is common in sports and can be found in tennis the NFL playoffs and the NCAA college basketball playoffs.

A third common practice in traditional tournament structures is the reluctance to eliminate fantasy competitors early on in the tournament even when they are doing poorly. As a general rule fantasy players consider fantasy sports to be an entertainment outlet for the entire season. Early elimination from a tournament runs counter to this fundamental expectation. The various embodiments described herein provide a non obvious solution or feature to address this common practice problem. As described above a single elimination tournament structure helps to address the problem of slow elimination of under performing players. However this solution does not address the finality of getting eliminated quickly in the tournament. In an example embodiment a solution is implemented to offset this problem by creating non lottery effect qualifying tournaments that are staggered throughout the beginning of a given sports season and that provide a re entry component. This allows the tournament to immediately eliminate or disqualify fantasy players that lose during a given round but also provides an opportunity for them to opt back into the tournament by paying a new entry fee. The end result of this paradigm is that fantasy players can play in the tournament for quite some time like they traditionally have but it also creates a format to hold a single round elimination tournament where fantasy players are eliminated if they lose a particular match. Some fantasy tournaments may appear to offer a re entry component but they really aren t. Each week they are holding a new lottery with the winner gaining a seat into the main tournament. In contrast the embodiments described herein provide a system and method enabling fantasy players to have the opportunity to buy their way back into a tournament and still compete in small player groups without penalizing the players who advanced from the previous round s . There are two ways to do this. First fantasy players can pay higher fees to replace the rounds that they skipped to buy back into the tournament. Secondly a method as disclosed herein is provided to allow fantasy players back into the tournament for the same price yet replicating the same number of rounds that contestants who signed up earlier and have already advanced at least one round are required to play. In this manner re entry players do not gain an advantage over players who advanced from the previous round s .

A fourth common practice in traditional tournament structures is the practice of fantasy players exclusively owning their athletes. This is a universal practice in traditional tournaments with the exception of lottery effect tournaments. The various embodiments described herein provide a non obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. For tournament play it is not practical to have a draft before every round. Moreover if group play is a feature of the tournament there has to be a system in place where athletes are selected quickly. The best way to do this is to permit duplication of athletes similar to what is done in lottery tournaments but only if duplication of athletes comes at a price. There must be penalties for duplication of athletes. The way to accomplish this is to have a blind submission process where the more a given athlete is duplicated the fewer fantasy points everyone in the player group that selected that athlete receives.

A fifth common practice in traditional tournament structures is the limited strategy that currently exists with submitting lineups. With current formats what one fantasy player submits has almost no bearing at all on what their opponent submits in terms of potential bonuses and penalties. The various embodiments described herein provide a non obvious solution or feature to address this common practice. As mentioned in the previous point the example embodiment penalizes fantasy players for duplication of athletes. This is not the only way to penalize them though. The example embodiment is also configured to penalize fantasy players for not valuing a given athlete highly enough. This will force fantasy players to evaluate athletes not only on merit but also on the likelihood that several other competitors in their player group might potentially select the same athletes. Also the example embodiment is configured to offer bonuses by weighting the athletes. This can be done by requiring fantasy players to submit lineups with a listing of athletes in order of preference. The higher the athlete is ranked or slotted the more potential bonus points the player will receive. This will create strategy where fantasy players really have to think about where their athletes should be placed on the lineup and create a climate where competing fantasy players try to out think each other.

A sixth common practice in traditional tournament structures is the inability of many fantasy enthusiasts to differentiate between the actual fantasy games that have created a cultural phenomenon and frankly don t need to be changed and separate this from the flawed tournament structures that need to be fixed. Fantasy sports games are so compelling that it makes it less likely that people will look to find out of the box solutions for fixing flawed tournaments formats for fear of incurring the wrath of fantasy players. As a result the status quo remains in place. In contrast the various embodiments described herein provide a non obvious set of solutions or features to address the failures of the traditional tournament structures.

The various embodiments of systems and methods for creating a Holy Grail tournament are described herein. The tournament format in an example embodiment utilizes a two tiered structure. First qualifying tournaments are used to qualify fantasy players that feed directly into a main event tournament. Secondly a main tournament is used to determine an overall winner as well as other top finishers. It is important to note that individual features within each of these two tournament formats don t necessarily have to be in the order described. Some are not even required to hold a Holy Grail tournament but are listed to enhance the quality of the tournament. Finally the idea of having qualifying tournaments to get into a main event isn t unprecedented. The problem with what is currently available is that all variations fall into the trap of either offering one of the two variations Head to Head or Lottery Effect that was described earlier. For example FanDuel offers a Main Event where hundreds or even thousands of people are forced to compete against one another simultaneously to try and qualify for the Main Event. It is extremely discouraging for fantasy players to enter a tournament knowing that the only way to gain entry into the Main Event is if they post the highest score out of several hundred or thousand people.

The goal is to create a predetermined number of qualifying tournaments that feed into a Main Event tournament. In an example embodiment these qualifying tournaments have the following features. Matches are played in small groups of three or more fantasy players. A predetermined number of winning fantasy players advance to the next qualifying round or qualify directly into the Main Event tournament . For example if groups are set at 12 members each it might be determined that the top three scores in each group will advance. The particular scoring system for determining fantasy points for an athlete can be any that is commonly used or one that is completely new to the industry. Fantasy players submit their lineups via a blind submission process. The more duplication that occurs for a given athlete during this blind submission process the less they will be worth. There is a re entry component that allows contestants to opt back in either by 1 by allowing them to pay more money for playing less rounds or 2 allowing them to re enter at the same price by duplicating the number of rounds that advancing contestants have been required to play. If they re enter by paying more money for less rounds there might be a qualifying tournament where it only takes advancing four rounds to qualify directly into the Main Event tournament and there might be a qualifying tournament that takes nine rounds to advance to the Main Event Tournament. The qualifying tournament that takes more rounds to qualify would be less expensive to enter. There is also an alternative version that can be used instead of the version previously described. If they re enter by paying the same amount of money that particular qualifying tournament would have to have the same number of rounds. This format requires creating options to include more and more rounds in a shorter period of time. What ends up happening is that individual rounds are contested in different ways than the earlier rounds see Explanation 4 below . Portions of some qualifying tournaments can run concurrently with other qualifying tournaments while other portions don t have to run concurrently. Fantasy players can purchase multiple entries for the same qualifying tournament. Fantasy players can enter more than one qualifying tournament at the same time. The Main Event tournament has a predetermined number of seats therefore it is critical that the satellite rounds are capped at an appropriate number so that there aren t more fantasy players qualifying for the Main Event tournament than there are seats available. Qualifying rounds can have several different types of formats for weighting athletes depending on where they are slotted see Explanation 1 .

Main Event consists of fantasy players who advanced via qualifying tournaments or directly buying in. The number of seats available for fantasy players in the Main Event is predetermined before the tournament even started. Main Event can either be a head to head format or a continuation of group play. If the Main Event is head to head fantasy players are randomly assigned an opponent. If there is nobody to whom they can be assigned they receive a bye to the next round. If the Main Event is group play then a predetermined number of fantasy players advance from each group for a given round. For the final group during the last round fantasy players play for final positions. In an example embodiment the scoring system for the Main Event should be a simple scoring system that fantasy players are familiar with from whatever sport the tournament is featuring. The Main Event should have a predetermined number of seats to ensure that it is possible to crown an overall champion as well as recognize top finishers.

The following description illustrates one example of a step by step explanation of how a Holy Grail tournament works in an example embodiment. Again these steps are interchangeable in many places and some of them aren t even required.

Step 1 Fantasy players are presented with different options for entering a qualifying tournament. They will find that the more rounds a qualifying tournament offers the less expensive they are to play in see Explanation 3 and Table 1 in the Appendix below . Table 1 shows a satellite tournament structure for a fantasy sports tournament.

Step 2 Caps are established by the computer program to ensure that there are not more seats allocated for the Main Event Tournament than it can support see Table 2 in the Appendix below . Table 2 shows how caps are established for qualifying tournaments.

Step 3 Once a fantasy player has entered a qualifier they will be assigned a group. Group play is a technique that helps create the proper spacing a tournament needs to accommodate millions of fantasy players see Explanation 2 below for different group formats . There are two ways groups can be filled. They can either be filled one group at a time see to ensure that each group has the maximum number of fantasy players established by the tournament rules or instead a predetermined number of groups can be established and fantasy players are placed into the groups in a manner where each group receives their first fantasy player before a second is added in and so on see .

Step 4 Fantasy players are required to turn in their lineups via a blind submission process see and . Fantasy players will have to take into consideration how athletes are weighted and also the likelihood of being duplicated see Explanation 1 below .

Step 6 The computer program of an example embodiment calculates the fantasy point value each athlete is worth based on duplication of athletes see Table 3 and Table 4 in the Appendix below . Table 3 shows how a given athlete loses a percentage of their fantasy points based on two or more fantasy players selecting that same athlete for their lineups. Table 4 shows the calculations of several athletes recalibrated fantasy points based on how much duplication occurred.

Step 7 If a player fails to get their lineup in for a match their previous lineup will be submitted as a default lineup for the match by the computer program of an example embodiment.

Step 8 Live athletic competition in the corresponding sport takes place. The computer program of an example embodiment has ongoing scoring updates and shows each fantasy player their running score and where they rank overall in their group.

Step 9 Once all of the real life sporting events are completed that are relevant to the group fantasy match the computer program of an example embodiment tabulates final scores based on the given weighting and duplication systems used for the match see Table 5 in the Appendix below . Table 5 shows a final tally of a fantasy match that incorporates both weighting bonuses and duplication penalties.

Step 10 The computer program of an example embodiment determines a cutoff for each group. The number of fantasy players that are qualified to advance for a given round of the qualifying process move onto the next qualifying round or move onto the Main Event Tournament if they advance during the last qualifying round and the remaining members of the group are eliminated see .

Step 11 The process begins anew for qualifying rounds and the first ten steps are repeated over and over until a fantasy player is either eliminated or qualifies for the Main Event Tournament. Fantasy players can either re enter by buying into a new qualifying tournament or they have advanced from a previous round of a qualifying tournament and are placed in a group for the new round.

Step 12 For Main Event Tournament rounds the same format is in place if group play is in effect. The only exception is for the last round of the tournament where fantasy players compete for final positions instead of trying to advance. If the Main Event Tournament is structured in a head to head format fantasy players are randomly assigned to play in a particular match. Each single match keep in mind that the number of matches is predetermined must have one fantasy player assigned to it before assignments for an opponent are made see .

Step 13 Any match that has only one fantasy player assigned to it results in that fantasy player receiving a bye for the round and automatically advancing to the next round see .

Step 14 If for some reason there isn t a fantasy player assigned to a match a double bye is declared and a bye will be entered into the mix for the next round. The fantasy player that is assigned this bye will be awarded a bye during that new round and will move on to the next round see .

Step 17 The fantasy player with the better score moves on to the next round the loser is eliminated from the tournament.

Step 18 The last two standing will play for the championship with the fantasy player with the higher fantasy point total earning the tournament championship and their opponent earning the runner up position.

Explanation 1 Weighting the point values of fantasy players based on a the slotted position in which an athlete was selected and or b how many fantasy players selected them. Weighting athletes based on how they were prioritized and or how often they were duplicated is a process that forces fantasy players to think very carefully about which athletes they submit and where they place them in their lineup hierarchy. This is especially true for formats that require fantasy players competing against each other to turn in their lineups via a blind submission process. A blind submission method is where all the fantasy players in a group competing against one another are required to turn in their lineups before they find out what the others in the group submitted.

The following are examples of some techniques used in an example embodiment to weight the players. Fantasy players are awarded multiples of the fantasy points their athletes scored depending on where their athletes were selected. For example assume each fantasy player selects five athletes. For each fantasy player s first slotted athlete the athlete could be worth five times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player s second slotted athlete the athlete could be worth four times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player s third slotted athlete the athlete could be worth three times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player s fourth slotted athlete the athlete could be worth two times the fantasy points they scored in their match. For each fantasy player s fifth slotted athlete the athlete could be worth face value of the fantasy points they scored in their match. The following is a table illustrating a hypothetical example that could be from a 12 player group competing for example in a fantasy cricket tournament 

Another weighting method that can be implemented in an alternative embodiment is one where fantasy players are given a percentage of the fantasy points an athlete earned depending on where the player selected that athlete. For example if each fantasy player is asked to select eight athletes the selected athletes can be weighted by having the first athlete everyone selects be worth 100 of their fantasy points the second athlete selected can be worth 87.5 of their fantasy points the third worth 75 of their fantasy points the fourth worth 62.5 of their fantasy points the fifth worth 50 of their fantasy points the sixth worth 37.5 of their fantasy points the seventh worth 25 of their fantasy points and the eighth worth 12.5 of their fantasy points. The following is a table illustrating a hypothetical example of this method using athletes from the Philippine Basketball League as an example Note that duplication of athletes is permitted in this example 

Another format that can be implemented in an alternative embodiment penalizes fantasy players for duplication of athletes. Using this method fantasy players are allowed to share athletes but the more duplication that occurs reduces the percentage of fantasy points each fantasy player receives for that given athlete. For example here is a sample duplication table for up to a 12 player fantasy match.

In the example above 1 is read as one time which means a given athlete was selected by exactly 1 of the 12 fantasy players. Also note that the in the example above the percentages are not fixed. They are completely arbitrary. For this example table the spreads were distributed equally to the nearest whole percentage based on how many fantasy players selected a given athlete.

The highlighted bolded and underlined portion of the table represents a seven player fantasy group where five of the members submitted the same athlete. Because duplication of athletes is permitted in an example embodiment each of the members would have that athlete in their lineups but each of the members would receive only 33 of the fantasy points that athlete scored in their match.

Once the live sporting events have been completed the actual fantasy points an athlete scores are converted to their adjusted fantasy points based on how many other fantasy players selected a given athlete. The following table is an example from a hypothetical group of NFL athletes that shows an example of this conversion.

To calculate the Adjusted Fantasy Score in an example embodiment the computer program can multiply the Actual Fantasy Score by the Percentage Multiplier. For instance in the example above Michael Vick scored 31 actual fantasy points and two players selected Vick as an athlete in their player lineups. Because two players selected Vick as an athlete in their player lineups each player will receive 91 of those actual fantasy points. Thus Vick s Adjusted Fantasy Score in this example is 31 0.91 28.21.

Another technique that is similar to the previous example punishes fantasy players more severely for duplication of athlete selection. In this embodiment the system splits the fantasy points that an athlete earns with every member of the group that selected the athlete. For example if an athlete scores 32 fantasy points and five fantasy players selected the athlete then each member of the group that selected the athlete would receive 6.4 fantasy points 32 divided by 5 equals 6.4 .

The weighting systems can also be combined. For example the following table shows an example from a 20 player fantasy cricket match where the slots are weighted according to where an athlete was selected and the percentage of fantasy points listed under their name and country they earn is based on how many other fantasy players selected a given athlete.

Explanation 2 Structuring some or all of a tournament in groups of three or more players. Because sporting events are almost universally structured where either one team competes against another team such as in football basketball baseball etc. or one individual competes against another individual such as in boxing wrestling tennis etc. or individuals compete against the entire field simultaneously such as in golf motor sports cycling etc. the fantasy sports industry has been a victim of these formats when it comes to creating tournaments for fantasy sports enthusiasts. For that reason there has never been a fantasy tournament where an unlimited number of people can play without being subjected to playing the entire field at the same time. The various embodiments described herein provide a solution to this problem with existing fantasy tournaments.

Even though real life sporting events don t usually have seven teams compete against each other at the same time there is no reason why this can t happen for a fantasy sports match. Instead of structuring fantasy tournaments as if they were real sporting events there is no reason why the format can t look more like a card game with several players competing against one another simultaneously. This format allows more fantasy players to compete in the tournament without subjecting them to having to face the entire field at once.

There is little doubt that having fantasy players compete in small groups runs counter to how people think fantasy tournaments should be held. But it is the only way to allow an unlimited number of players the opportunity to enter without subjecting them to competing against the entire field at the same time.

In the various example embodiments described herein there are several specific formats that use a group play format some are more effective than others because of the time it takes to create a full lineup to submit . These formats in an example embodiment include the following sample formats.

Group Tournament Type 1 Using a Fantasy Draft Leagues of 10 to 12 people have been getting together and drafting for fantasy leagues since the origins of fantasy sports. However the purpose of a draft in traditional leagues has always been to form a league where members of the group play each other in one on one matches throughout the season to see which fantasy owners emerge with the best records to playoff for the championship.

In the various embodiments described herein an important distinction is made between traditional leagues and the small player groups used in the various embodiments. Instead of drafting to compete in a league as is traditionally done small groupings of players come together typically online to draft for a single match where everyone in the group is playing everyone else in the group simultaneously. This simultaneous play between all members of the group does not occur in traditional leagues. In the various embodiments described herein a predetermined number of top scores from this fantasy player group earn the right to advance to the next round. For example a group of 12 entries fantasy players playing in a fantasy cricket tournament might end up drafting athletes with the understanding that the top 3 scores are to advance to the next round. The number of scores necessary to advance can be predetermined.

To conduct a Holy Grail tournament online using this particular format in accordance with an example embodiment described herein fantasy players would pay a fee which would automatically put them in an online draft room that is capped at a certain number of entries for a given group. The online draft room can be implemented as an online collection of users fantasy players in a manner similar to the way collections of online users can gather in a chat room. For example the fantasy game might be rugby that allows ten entries fantasy players per group with the top two scores advancing to the next round. This doesn t necessarily mean that the group will ultimately end up with ten people because this is determined by when the first person of a given group enters the online draft room. Once the first person enters a time limit is set for example 20 minutes for the group to fill up with ten people. Once it does the draft starts immediately with the drafting order determined by when the players show up in the draft room. The earlier a person appears the higher they draft. The draft can follow a serpentine format as defined above.

If not enough fantasy players fill the ten spaces the draft begins when the allotted time has passed with however many people are in the draft room. If the number of people in the draft room is less than or equal to the number of fantasy players that are supposed to advance from a group determined by the tournament rules the fantasy players automatically receive byes to the next round and do not compete in a match against each other for that round.

Group Tournament Type 2 Holding a Fantasy Draft with a Bidding Twist Once again the example embodiment provides a draft amongst a small group of fantasy players who compete against each other in a single match. Parts of the draft protocol are the same as the first tournament format described above. For instance the mechanics of how the first person in the draft room starts the clock to determine the number of people that will be in the group is the same.

The draft rules are completely different though from a traditional draft. In this format fantasy players don t necessarily get the athlete they draft. In this format of an example embodiment every fantasy player is given a set amount of credits to spend in order to secure athletes. All members of the group can bid on an athlete who was drafted. For example let s assume it is a fantasy football draft and every fantasy player is given 50 credits to secure one quarterback QB two running backs RB s and two wide receivers WR s . The fantasy player who initially drafts a given football player automatically has a 1 credit bid for that player to kick off the bidding process. The draft bidding process then goes to the next fantasy player in the draft. The next fantasy player can either bid 2 or more credits must bid in increments of 1 can t use fractions or pass to the next fantasy player in the draft.

Only when the draft bidding process goes through the entire group of fantasy players back to the person who has the highest bid on record does the bidding end for this football player athlete . The fantasy player who made the winning bid has the number of credits they bid deducted from their credit account. They are the only fantasy player in the group who is allowed to start that football player for their lineup. The draft then goes back to the original order where the second fantasy player drafting introduces a new football player on whom the fantasy players in the group can bid.

If a fantasy player runs out of credits without filling up all of their positions they no longer can bid and must wait for the free agent draft which comes immediately after the main draft. This free agent draft happens once everyone has either filled out an entire lineup or run out of credits. The free agent draft is then held only for the fantasy players who still have places to fill. This draft goes in reverse order from the original draft order. A fantasy player drafting can only take one football player when it is their turn. If they have more than one place to fill they must wait until the drafting process comes back to them again. Once a fantasy player fills their entire roster they are automatically dropped from the free agent draft.

Group Tournament Type 3 Blind Submission Format Sharing Fantasy Points of Duplicated Athletes In an example embodiment a blind submission format is utilized when lineup submissions happen exactly one time. Small groups competing against one another submit lineups for all required positions using a blind submission format e.g. where fantasy players have to turn in their lineups without knowing what other fantasy players involved in the match selected . Duplication of athletes is permitted but when this happens there is a penalty. All fantasy players who submitted a duplicated athlete will evenly split that athlete s point total for the match. For example if eleven fantasy players competing in a fantasy soccer group have six of the fantasy players submit athlete Lionel Messi for their lineup i.e. a duplicated athlete then those six fantasy players will evenly split however many fantasy points Messi scored in his game. In the case of multiple games the six fantasy players would either split the average or split the total points. If Messi scored 14 fantasy points for his game each fantasy player would receive 2.33 rounded to nearest hundredth fantasy points because 14 divided by 6 equals 2.33.

This type of penalty creates a tremendous amount of strategy and elevates second tier players to the forefront. Fantasy players might opt to pass on superstars because lesser players have less of a chance of being duplicated. Sometimes these types of tournaments only have three to five starting positions to fill.

Group Tournament Type 4 Blind Submission Format Lowering the Value of Duplicated Athletes This is a variation of the previous format. This format variation is also an effective way to hold a tournament where lineups can only be submitted one time. This format is also played where all members competing in a group submit lineups using a blind submission format. Once again duplication of athletes is permitted but the penalty is different from the previous format described above. The penalty for duplication is the reduction of the fantasy points an athlete scores. The more duplication that occurs the less they are worth. For example in fantasy baseball if a 12 person group has only one member fantasy player who submits athlete Albert Pujols the member might get 100 of the fantasy points corresponding to the submitted athlete. If two members of that group selected athlete Pujols each selecting member might get only 90 of the selected athlete s fantasy points. If three people selected the same athlete each selecting member might get only 80 of the selected athlete s fantasy points and so on. The point reductions can range from a completely arbitrary system of penalties all the way to a very well calibrated method.

The table set forth below is an example of an embodiment that determines what percentage of an athlete s points a given fantasy participant receives based completely on how many other competitors also selected that athlete. It is important to note that the percentages listed are arbitrary. Any percentages can be used that penalize fantasy players the more duplication of athlete selection that occurs.

The highlighted bolded and underlined percentage shown in the table above represents a seven player fantasy group where five of the fantasy players selected the same athlete. For example let s assume five of the seven players selected Michael Vick to be their starting quarterback for an upcoming match. What this means is that each of the five fantasy players will have Vick in their starting lineup but they will each receive only 33 of the points Vick scores that week round .

The table below is a hypothetical example from a fantasy football tournament and shows the starting NFL athletes that a 12 person group has selected. The percentage under each athlete s name represents the percentage that the fantasy player selecting that athlete will get to keep of the actual fantasy points that their selected NFL athlete scored for a particular week. This percentage is based on the number of times an NFL athlete was duplicated and is taken directly from the table above.

Group Tournament Type 5 Blind Submission Format Bidding for Athletes This type of format is used over several days of bidding. Fantasy players in a group submit lineups along with a percentage next to the name of each athlete they submit. The percentage represents how small of a portion of an athlete s fantasy points they are willing to accept in order to secure that athlete for their lineup. In other words a fantasy player is willing to give up some of the fantasy points a given athlete scores because they covet them so much. The fantasy player with the lowest bid wins that athlete. For example if three fantasy players select athlete Adrian Peterson to be their running back for a football tournament and the bids are 100 93 and 87 then the fantasy player who bid 87 wins Peterson for their lineup. The catch is that the fantasy player who bid 87 would only get 87 of whatever Peterson s fantasy points are for a given game. The other two fantasy players not winning the athlete would have to submit a new athlete s name for this position during the next round of bidding. If two or more fantasy players submit the same winning bid for an athlete each of the fantasy players would get that athlete in their lineup for the bid amount they presented. Once an athlete has been placed in at least one person s lineup in the group the athlete cannot be bid on again by anyone for the match.

After the final round a free agent draft is conducted using a computer generated drafting order. Only the fantasy players who don t have a complete lineup are eligible for the free agent draft. Fantasy players can only select one athlete when it is their turn in the free agent draft. If a fantasy player has multiple holes to fill in their lineup the fantasy player must wait for their turn to select an athlete in the free agent draft process. Once a fantasy player has filled out their lineup from the free agent draft they are automatically dropped from the draft. All athletes in the free agent draft are worth 100 of their fantasy points.

The tables below illustrate an example of a three day submission process for a fantasy baseball tournament. Each fantasy player has to submit a bid for five athletes non pitchers . There are no restrictions as to what position the athletes play.

In the example above Bold text denotes a winning bid. Note in the example above two fantasy players secured athlete AROD at 91 and three fantasy players secured athlete Fielder at 95 .

In the example above Bold text denotes a winning bid. Underlined text denotes an athlete previously secured with a value indicating the percentage the athlete is worth. Note in the example above two fantasy players secured athlete C. Jones at 100 and athlete Mauer of Minnesota at 98 .

In the example above Bold text denotes a winning bid. Underlined text denotes an athlete previously secured with a value indicating the percentage the athlete is worth.

In the example above fantasy players 3 4 7 10 and 11 e.g. fantasy players with openings to fill would then participate in a free agent fantasy draft until all their openings in this case each has one are filled. The fantasy players in the free agent fantasy draft can select any baseball athlete non pitcher that has not been selected by someone in the group. These free agents will each be worth 100 of their fantasy points.

Group Tournament Type 6 Blind Submission Format Using a Cap This type of tournament can be done on a one shot basis but is best used over multiple rounds of submissions. Fantasy players are allocated a certain number of credits for a blind submission process to fill in their lineups. The fantasy player that bids the highest for a given athlete earns the right to have the athlete in their lineup while all the other members of the group lose the opportunity to play this athlete. Once the last round of submissions has passed a free agent draft will be conducted for any fantasy player who still has lineup slots to fill. The free agent draft is for athletes who haven t been selected by anyone in the group.

A fantasy player may use all of their credits before the selection process has finished. If they happen to do this and they still have positions to fill the fantasy player must wait until the free agent draft which begins at the end of the last round of submissions. Also if two or more fantasy players submit an identical bid and it turns out to be the highest one for a given athlete each of them will enter this athlete into their lineups at the fantasy value they each submitted.

The tables below illustrate an example of a progression of an NBA fantasy basketball tournament. In this example there are 12 fantasy players participating in the group. Each of them starts with 50 credits to fill 5 lineup positions. In this hypothetical tournament the actual positions the NBA athletes play are irrelevant. A fantasy player can fill all the positions with forwards if they wish. Also there is no requirement forcing a fantasy player to bid on all slots. If s he chooses a fantasy player can strategically bid high for a couple of superstars and then rely on the free agent draft to fill their remaining roster slots.

In the example above Bold text denotes a winning bid. Note that fantasy players can bid any or all of their credits for any given round of submissions. In the example above athlete Griffin was secured by players 1 and 5.

In the example above Bold text denotes a winning bid. Underlined text denotes an athlete previously secured. In the example above athlete Rondo was secured by both fantasy player 10 and 12.

In the example above Bold text denotes a winning bid. Underlined text denotes an athlete previously secured.

In the example above fantasy players 1 4 7 9 10 11 and 12 would then participate in a free agent fantasy draft until each fills all of their openings. A fantasy player gets one selection per round. Once a given fantasy player has all their slots filled they are automatically dropped from the free agent draft.

Group Tournament Type 7 Blind Submission Format Meeting a Minimum Threshold In an example embodiment this format might appear to be a Lottery Effect format but it is not. This type of group tournament acts the same way that small group Holy Grail tournaments do even though everyone competes against each other simultaneously. This is a bona fide Holy Grail tournament even though it does not have fantasy players competing in small groups. This can be accomplished by setting up a minimum threshold tournament.

A minimum threshold tournament recognizes that more than 50 of the contestants need to be eliminated at each round. This is because the one on one match play format eliminates half the contestants each week. But this has already proven to be ineffective for a tournament that attracts the masses. On the other hand a minimum threshold tournament must be more forgiving than having everyone compete at the same time with one person left standing. This format is virtually a 100 certainty that a random player loses. The way to fix this problem is to hone in on a percentage somewhere between the 50 and 100 extremes that are incompatible with holding a successful Holy Grail tournament. This type of strategy generates the same small group dynamic that is so conducive to creating a dynamic Holy Grail tournament.

The format for the tournament is relatively simple. Fantasy players have to meet a minimum performance threshold between 50 and 100 each round. Let s arbitrarily pick 70 . What this means is that all fantasy players have to beat 70 of the field for a given week to advance to the next round. Fantasy players have to submit a lineup each round and there is no penalty for duplication because millions of people can be playing each other simultaneously. Once the field narrows duplication penalties can be utilized.

A key difference between this format and the flawed models that are currently available is that this format gives fantasy players hope. Instead of having to emerge as the top person out of a group of millions of people one only has to finish in the top thirty or forty percent to advance. Fantasy players will gravitate towards this because it is a tournament of skill and most players believe they have what it takes to finish in the top 30 or whatever the pre determined number is. Once this is method is used for 8 to 12 rounds it becomes possible to whittle millions of entries down to a manageable level so that it is possible to conduct one on one match play events for the remaining rounds to determine an overall winner.

This type of tournament like all the tournament formats described above can be used for any fantasy sport. To illustrate how this type of tournament works consider a particular sample tournament where there are 50 million entries and the pre determined tournament rules specify the use of a 30 rule for the first 12 weeks of an NFL football season. For weeks 13 through 17 of the NFL season the tournament concludes with one on one match play. An example of the numbers of fantasy players advancing at the end of each week in the sample tournament are shown below.

The submission process for the one on one match play format is different than the first 12 weeks where lineups are simply turned in and fantasy players have to finish in the top 30 . For the one on one match play phase which begins week 13 there could be a three round it could be a different number of rounds submission process. An example of this submission process is set forth below.

Round 1 Lineups are compared. If a given position has a different athlete submitted the two competitors fantasy players lock in this athlete into their starting lineups. If a given position has the same athlete submitted this athlete is disqualified from the match and cannot be resubmitted by either fantasy player. All open slots will be resubmitted the next round.

Round 3 All open slots require two submissions by each fantasy player. One submission is the intended starting athlete and the other is a backup athlete. The intended starter athlete must also have a percentage value associated with the starter athlete. This percentage represents the percentage of fantasy points a fantasy player is willing to deduct from a given athlete s fantasy score to get the athlete in their lineup. This only comes into play if both fantasy players submit the same athlete for an open position. If the submitted athletes are different then each fantasy player will lock them in at 100 . If however the submitted athletes are the same the bids will be compared. The fantasy player with the lower percentage bid gets that athlete at the percentage they bid. That fantasy player secures that athlete for their lineup but it comes with a penalty. The fantasy player only receives the percentage of fantasy points they bid for the match while their opponent gets their backup athlete they submitted for this position at 100 of their fantasy point total. If the percentage bid is the same both fantasy players will lock in their backup athletes in at 100 . If their backups are the same athlete they will each get the backup athlete at 100 which effectively cancels each other out for this position.

One on One Match Play Tournament Type 8 Blind Submission Format Valuing slots at different percentages There are some techniques that are also quite effective for matches that involve two players. The following example allows for duplication and is especially effective when there are a limited number of athletes from which to choose.

In the example presented below assume that it is one of the Main Event rounds of a soccer fantasy tournament and fantasy players are competing head to head. Fantasy players have been paired off in these matches with each slot having a different value. The percentages below represent the percentage of fantasy points a fantasy player will be given of their selected athlete s fantasy points scored. It should be noted that these percentages are just an example and they can be of any value that a tournament organizer sees fit.

The percentage indicates the portion of fantasy points a given athlete scored that will be given to the corresponding fantasy player.

In the example above underlined values are Adjusted Fantasy Point values. In the example above fantasy Player 1 would move on in the tournament based on a 47.77 to 44.39 victory over Fantasy Player 2.

One on one Match Play Tournament Type 9 Blind Submission Format Disqualifying athletes that are duplicated This format of an example embodiment can be used over two or more rounds of fantasy players submitting athletes. An example of this type of tournament is illustrated in the hypothetical presented below. This example is from a football tournament.

In this example fantasy players submit six starter athletes for various positions on the fantasy football team one quarterback QB two running backs RB s two wide receivers WR s and 1 Flex position e.g. a RB or WR . Fantasy players also submit four tiebreakers which are used only to break ties. In this example these four tiebreakers include 1 one tight end TE that represents the 1tiebreaker 2 one defensive position that represents the 2tiebreaker 3 one kicker that represents the 3tiebreaker and 4 the 4tiebreaker can be represented as one tiebreaker NFL football team playing that week. Point differentials in the score of the game played by the tiebreaker NFL football team that week determine the fantasy value for the 4tiebreaker e.g. a 27 21 victory is a 6 conversely a 28 3 loss is a 25 . A 5tiebreaker can be represented as a computer generated coin flip produced by a random number generator.

Lineups are submitted over a three day period e.g. Wednesday Thursday and Friday by 8 00 PM EST for each day could be a greater or lesser number of days the number is arbitrary . All NFL athletes are eligible as long as they haven t been disqualified or already played in their game for the week.

On the first day of the lineup submission period e.g. Wednesday both fantasy players must have their lineups submitted. If both fail to do so a new deadline is set for the next day at for example 5 00 PM EST. If only one fantasy player has their lineup submitted the one fantasy player locks in all six of their starters in their starting lineup and all four tiebreakers into their tiebreaker lineup. Their opponent has until the last day of the lineup submission period e.g. Friday night at 5 00 PM EST to enter a lineup of six starting athletes and four tiebreaker athletes or the opponent forfeits the match. Once a starting athlete or tiebreaker position has been filled the opposing fantasy player cannot select the same NFL athlete or team that has already been locked in.

If both fantasy players submit their lineups within the lineup submission period the lineups are compared athlete by athlete. If any athlete or team is duplicated the athlete or team is immediately disqualified from the match and cannot be resubmitted again by either fantasy player. This disqualification includes a scenario wherein for example an NFL athlete is submitted by one fantasy player as a running back and their opponent submitted the same athlete as a flex player or other different position. All other starting athletes and tiebreaker athletes who aren t duplications are locked into the starting and tiebreaker slots for the respective fantasy players. The defense category and team category are not considered a duplication if the same NFL team is submitted in these two different categories. Duplicated athletes will leave open slots that will be resubmitted the next day.

On the second day of the lineup submission period e.g. Thursday if there are still open positions both fantasy players will be expected to turn in a lineup for the slots in their lineups that haven t been filled. If only one fantasy player turns in their lineup the athletes submitted by the one fantasy player are immediately locked in and their opponent has until the next day to fill in these open slots. Once a starting athlete or tiebreaker position has been filled the opponent cannot select the same NFL athlete or team that has already been locked in. In other respects the same rules apply as the previous day. Duplicated athletes and tiebreakers are disqualified and can t be resubmitted again. Non duplicated athletes teams are locked in. If there are any remaining openings there is one final day for submissions.

On the third day of the lineup submission period e.g. Friday if both fantasy players fail to submit a lineup during the entire three day period a double forfeit is declared and both fantasy players are eliminated from the tournament. If one player never submitted a lineup during any of the days and their opponent did then the fantasy player who turned in a lineup wins by forfeit and moves on to the next round. If one or both fantasy players submitted lineups at some point but one or both don t have complete lineups the fantasy players will compete against one another with open slots that receive zero points for every slot in their respective starting and tiebreaker lineups where this happens. If both fantasy players submit athletes for open slots on this final day of the lineup submission period both fantasy players will submit two options for each open slot. There will be a primary and a backup option. If the primary options are different athletes for a given position the athletes submitted as primary options will be locked into their respective lineups. If the athletes submitted as primary options are the same athlete or team then a bidding number that was submitted ahead of time will be checked. Fantasy players can submit a bidding number or bid from 1 to 100 . A bid of 93 means that a fantasy player covets that NFL athlete enough that they are willing to receive only 93 of the fantasy points this NFL athlete scores. At the same time their opponent will automatically get 100 of their backup options fantasy value to lose this athlete that they also coveted. Because both fantasy players are submitting a bid the fantasy player that makes the lowest percentage bid gets that NFL athlete for the week round . Once again the losing bidder gets their backup athlete for 100 of their fantasy point value. If however the bids happen to be the same then the equality of the bids disqualifies this NFL athlete from the match. The backup athlete names are then compared. If the backup athlete names are different they are locked in. If the backup athlete names are the same both fantasy players will play the match with an open slot for this position that will be scored as a zero.

Explanation 3 Creating staggered qualifying tournaments of the same or different lengths that feed into a Main Tournament A single elimination tournament can be very discouraging for people who get eliminated in the first round. The staggered qualifying feature allows rabid fantasy players multiple avenues to remain in and possibly win the tournament. This type of format can be used for virtually any type of sporting event that lasts at least five days. The important features of the staggered qualifying tournaments are described below.

In an example embodiment there are two stages to the tournament structure. There are several qualifying tournaments and there is a main tournament. Fantasy players can submit multiple entries for any qualifying tournament. Fantasy players can sign up for different qualifying tournaments at the same time. The main tournament has a predetermined number of seats available that fantasy players can either try to qualify for or directly buy their way into. The qualifying tournaments may or may not have different amounts of rounds in them. New qualifying tournaments can start at any time. There is no set time period that must elapse. The more rounds a qualifying tournament has the less expensive the rounds are to play in. Fantasy players who are eliminated can re enter because a new qualifying tournament will be starting soon.

These qualifying tournaments have the following features in an example embodiment. The qualifying tournaments are separate and distinct tournaments from one another. The qualifying tournaments don t always have the same number of rounds although there is no reason why they can t . Some qualifying tournaments are often running at the same time as other qualifying tournaments. The qualifying tournaments are staggered over a portion of the season in a way where the qualifying tournaments sometimes overlap each other completely sometimes partially and sometimes not at all.

In an example of the qualifying tournament structure used in an embodiment using the 2012 NFL season as an illustration we can randomly set up nine qualifying tournaments that each have a different number of rounds. The nine qualifying tournaments can be set up such that they are staggered in time. Fantasy players are placed in groups of 12 for each round with the top three fantasy players advancing. In the example illustrated below the nine qualifying tournaments are staggered in a way where the tournaments become increasingly shorter. Alternatively the qualifying tournaments can be staggered by making them increasingly longer. The data for each of the nine qualifying tournaments in the example are set forth below.

This staggering concept can also go in the opposite direction where the qualifying tournaments all start at the same time but end at different dates as shown below.

This staggering concept can also have the same number of rounds for some or even all of the satellites.

Once these qualifying tournaments have concluded the qualifying process is over and the main tournament begins. The format for each round of the main tournament could either be group play or fantasy players competing against each other head to head.

The staggering concept provided in the example embodiment can be used for sports where there is more than one game that is included in each round. For example the Major League Baseball season could be partitioned in a way where each satellite tournament is one week in length. An example of this scenario is shown below.

Explanation 4 Creating staggered qualifying tournaments with the same number of rounds The idea behind this format in an example embodiment denoted herein as the Wildcard and Super Wildcard Formats is to allow fantasy players to continue to re enter the tournament at a same low price throughout all qualifying tournaments. In order to do this the number of rounds must remain constant so there isn t an unfair advantage that any one group of contestants has depending on their entry point. What this means is that creative strategies must be developed to hold this set number of rounds as the tournament gets closer and closer to the Main Event. A Wildcard Format is used when more than one round is needed during an interval of the tournament where fantasy players who entered earlier might only be playing one round. This technique is used as a catch up mechanism so that all fantasy players end up playing the same number of rounds. Using NFL football as an example the regular season schedule always has morning and afternoon games. The morning games could be used as one round while the afternoon games serve as an additional round. When a Wildcard Format is needed it is necessary for fantasy players to give a Contingency Lineup for the PM games in advance because there is not enough time to submit lineups between the AM and PM games.

Sometimes there is so little time left that a Super Wildcard Format is needed. This happens when several rounds are needed in the same game as a way to catch up. A Super Wildcard Format breaks individual games or games happening simultaneously into two or more rounds. For example using an NFL fantasy football tournament again if there are 10 weeks for qualifying that cover the first 10 weeks of the regular season it is straightforward to hold a 10 round qualifying tournament. Each of those 10 weeks would constitute a round. There is no need for either a Wildcard or Super Wildcard Format. It gets more difficult to create 10 rounds though once there are no longer 10 weeks of NFL games to contest them. For example if during the 17th week of the NFL season a fantasy football tournament organizer wants to still charge the same 5 entry fee that they did in NFL week 1 they would have to create 10 rounds in order to make it fair. The only way to do so is by implementing a Super Wildcard Format where each game or group of simultaneously running games is broken down into two or more rounds. Below are two potential options to accomplish this result as illustrated by example.

During the 17week fantasy players can sign up for a one week version where the AM games count as four rounds e.g. one round for each quarter of the AM game and the PM games count as four rounds e.g. one round for each quarter of the PM game and the Sunday Night Game is a round and the Monday Night Game is a round e.g. Sunday night is Round 9 and Monday night is Round 10 . Because this structure involves four sets of lineups AM games PM games Sunday night game and Monday night game fantasy players will have to submit four lineups in order to play this format before any of the games begin. An example of this tournament structure is set forth below.

AM games begin at 10 AM PST for Rounds 1 through 4. Player statistics accumulate from 10 00 AM to 10 50 AM. Round 1 begins at 10 50 AM. Adjusted fantasy percentages are calibrated for groups.

Remaining top 3 fantasy players of each group advance to the 2nd round. New adjusted fantasy percentages calibrated for new groups

Remaining top 3 fantasy players of each group advance to the 3rd round. New adjusted fantasy percentages calibrated for new groups

Remaining top 3 fantasy players of each group advance to the 4th round. New adjusted fantasy percentages calibrated for new groups

PM games begin at 1 25 PM PST for Rounds 5 through 8. Player statistics accumulate from 1 25 to 2 15 PM. Round 5 begins at 2 15 PM. Adjusted fantasy percentages are calibrated for groups.

Remaining top 3 fantasy players of each group advance to the 6th round. New adjusted fantasy percentages calibrated for new groups.

Remaining top 3 fantasy players of each group advance to the 7th round. New adjusted fantasy percentages calibrated for new groups.

Remaining top 3 fantasy players of each group advance to the 8th round. New adjusted fantasy percentages calibrated for new groups.

The top 3 survivors from each group after round 8 are regrouped in a new group to begin round 9 which is played during Sunday night game. The top 3 survivors from each group of the Sunday night game then compete during the Monday night game for the 10th and final round. The top 3 survivors automatically qualify for the Main Event.

The process described above is one of the most important features developed as part of the various embodiments. The process includes the following important characteristic the process defines a set number of qualifying rounds that are needed to qualify for a Main Event and then offers these qualifying options during any point of the qualifying process. Additionally the described embodiments offer a variety of others features and benefits. An example embodiment described herein allows a qualifying process for a fantasy tournament Main Event to be compressed in terms of time. For some competitors the qualifying process might be two months or more. For other competitors the qualifying process might be a few weeks. For some competitors the qualifying process might be a week and for some the process might even be a day. Even though the time duration of the qualifying process can fluctuate dramatically the number of rounds a fantasy contestant must play during this qualifying process remains constant. If it is predetermined that a qualifying process is for 10 rounds then all qualifying tournaments must be 10 rounds regardless of whether the qualifying tournament is ten weeks or one day. This format allows people to re enter the qualifying process at the same low price point at any stage of the qualifying process without being subjected to a Lottery Effect type of parameters. Fantasy players are still able to compete in small groups. As seen from the above two examples this means that various embodiments as described herein can generate 10 or an arbitrary number of rounds for qualifying tournaments that have a very limited time period.

Explanation 5 Using Contingency Lineups to create exciting tournaments that have a limited number of days This is an extremely powerful embodiment that makes fantasy tournaments possible for situations where there are a very small number of days that the real life tournament is being conducted. Without using the Contingency Lineup technique there would be no possible way to hold these types of fantasy tournaments.

The Contingency Lineup Format of an example embodiment requires fantasy players to submit multiple lineups two or more before any of the games take place for a given day. If a given fantasy player advances to the next round then their next contingency lineup becomes their actual lineup. The reason that this format becomes necessary is because there may not be enough time to select new lineups for the next round. This is because a new set of games starts immediately after the games that just finished. An example demonstrating the power of this embodiment is set forth below.

During the NFL playoffs there are always 11 games. These 11 games are distributed over six unique days. Five days have two games each and then the Super Bowl is a standalone game during the sixth day. If there was no Contingency Lineup Format we could only have six rounds of play each day is one round because the way the games are scheduled is not conducive to submitting a new lineup once a fantasy player advances e.g. there is not enough time in between games to submit a new lineup . If a fantasy tournament organizer wanted to play the tournament in groups of 12 for each round with the top two scorers in each group advancing this creates a 6 to 1 ratio one person advancing for every six players . A 6 1 ratio over six rounds creates 93 312 potential openings. Let s assume that a tournament organizer wanted to offer a fantasy tournament for just the NFL playoffs and used the above technique without employing contingency lineups. This tournament organizer might set the asking price at 5 per entry and the grand prize at five million dollars. The tournament organizer might believe they have created an ideal high stakes fantasy sports tournament with a low entry fee a multi million dollar grand prize and small group play during individual rounds.

However the problem with this tournament organizer s tournament is that because only 93 312 people can play the tournament can only generate 466 560 if all of the seats are filled. Clearly it isn t financially possible to offer a five million dollar grand prize for a tournament that only has the capacity to generate less than half a million dollars in revenue.

The Contingency Lineups of the example embodiment described herein can change this result. If each of the 11 games became an individual round by using Contingency Lineups for games where one comes immediately after another a whole new landscape can be created. This new arrangement allows for over 750 000 000 three quarters of a billion entries. This type of format would easily support a five million dollar grand prize for 5 entry fees.

In an alternative embodiment a tournament can be implemented that uses RINGS. RINGS or rings as denoted herein is an acronym for Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size. In an example embodiment a tournament using rings provides a more robust and fair way to handle group play. In an example embodiment a tournament supporting rings includes the following novel characteristics not seen before in any prior fantasy sports tournaments that have a large number of entries e.g. entries of 100 000 or more people . The characteristics of a tournament with rings can include the following 

Avoiding Trap Rounds All previous attempts of large scale fantasy sports tournaments of 100 000 or more entries have at LEAST one trap round in the tournament. A trap round is a given round or multiple rounds of a tournament where participants are placed together in such large numbers that a random participant has less than a 1 mathematical chance to advance. In essence a lottery is created which negates the skill level of the players competing. This is because a portion of the tournament is based on pure luck which makes the tournament less than desirable to play in for players. A tournament with RINGS NEVER has a trap round.

Small Group Play In an example embodiment a tournament supporting rings provides an opportunity for small skill based group play.

Skill Based The 10 Rule In a tournament supporting rings fantasy players always mathematically have at least a 10 chance to advance to the next round. This is true for every contested part of the tournament. This defines a skill based tournament.

RINGS RINGS Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size are the combination of small group play contested over multiple rounds two rounds or more . RINGS are the answer to the problem with which current high stakes fantasy sports models are struggling. There has never been a version of a tournament created that offers the two money maker components of an effective tournament e.g. low entry fees and a multi million dollar grand prize that also is skill based at least a 10 chance to advance in every round . Moreover every high stakes fantasy sports tournament example ever attempted in the conventional art has had a least one portion where there is a trap round with a less than 1 chance to advance.

Combining Regular and Post Seasons Prior examples of fantasy tournaments have included only the regular season of a given sport while others have included only the post season. An example embodiment of the tournament described herein provides both the regular season and the post season together in a single tournament. Conventional implementations do not provide a fantasy sports tournament that includes both the regular season and the post season together. The example embodiment of the tournament described herein works in conjunction with RINGS to provide both the regular season and the post season together. The importance of this dynamic should not be underestimated. There are many gaming barriers that had to be addressed to offer this format which is why nobody has ever thought of putting both together in the same tournament.

Scrambles An example embodiment of the tournament described herein provides a scrambles process where players enter RINGS competitions and compete in group play for an increasingly higher prize every time they advance in consecutive rounds. For example if a fantasy player is competing in a Scramble they might receive 5 for finishing in the top 3 of a group of 12 and an automatic berth in a second round Scramble. If they finish in the top 3 of 12 for this second Scramble they might win 10 and an automatic bid to a third round Scramble. This process continues on until a pre determined number of rounds is reached for a chance to win a grand prize.

An example embodiment of the tournament structure described herein that supports rings can enable various related methods such as the method described below.

A method comprising prompting by execution of a data processor a large number defined as 100 000 or more of users at a corresponding large number of user platforms to each submit a nominal buy in for entry into a fantasy sports tournament the users submitting the nominal buy in becoming fantasy players of the fantasy sports tournament partitioning by execution of the data processor the fantasy players of the fantasy sports tournament into player groups called rings that compete to advance through a pre determined number of rounds to a main tournament RINGS is an acronym for Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size at least one player ring having at least three fantasy players as ring members the fantasy players in each player ring only playing against other members of the same player ring during a given round receiving from each member of each player ring a selection of athletes corresponding to each member and scoring each member of each player ring based on the performance of selected athletes members of each player ring who do not score within a predetermined number of advancing players for their given ring relative to the other members of the same player ring are disqualified from the fantasy sports tournament enabling a disqualified fantasy player to re enter the fantasy sports tournament after submittal of an additional fee by either a paying the same fee again which requires playing one or more additional rounds to catch up to the number of rounds other players have played or b paying an additional fee to bypass rounds that have already been played enabling an advancing player to move on to the next round of the tournament without having to pay an additional charge as the advancing player is placed in a new ring of players who also have successfully advanced to the same stage of the tournament and configuring the fantasy sports tournament to include rings.

An example embodiment of the tournament structure described herein that supports rings can be part of a larger high stakes fantasy sports tournament format. In the example embodiment there are seven essential features that distinguish this new tournament format from existing tournament formats. These seven essential features are described in more detail below.

In the example embodiment described herein there are seven key features or characteristics that a high stakes fantasy sports tournament requires to be successful. These seven key features can be broken into two categories. These categories include 

The best any conventional fantasy sports company in the industry has done in the past is to offer a few of these seven features in the same tournament. However no conventional tournament format has included all seven features or key combinations of these seven features. RINGS Rounds Involving Narrow Group Size as described above are a key component that has been left out of all conventional high stakes fantasy tournaments. Even more importantly no conventional fantasy sports tournament has ever offered both of the Money Category features described above which include a low entry fee and a multi million dollar grand prize in combination with the Gaming Structure Category feature of skill as a factor .

In the example embodiment described herein the seven key features or characteristics listed above are important for a high stakes fantasy sports tournament to be successful. The reasons why each of these seven ingredients are so important are described next.

People like to play when the risk level is minimal. Tournaments that offer a low entry fee are always going to have the potential to draw many more people than ones with pricey entry fees.

When tournaments have a low entry fee paired with a multi million dollar grand prize the potential is extraordinary especially if there is skill involved in the tournament format. No conventional multi million dollar tournament in the fantasy sports genre has ever had a skill component because every single one of them has always had at least one trap component in the tournament e.g. at least one occasion in the tournament when fantasy players face less than a 1 chance to advance to a next round in the tournament .

The example embodiment described herein uses both the regular season and the playoffs of a given sport in the same tournament. No conventional fantasy sports tournament provider has ever implemented a combination of the regular season and the playoffs of a given sport in the same tournament. This combination allows for much greater flexibility in the number of entries the tournament can accommodate.

This is where conventional fantasy sports companies have gotten it consistently wrong. Conventional fantasy tournaments weed out fantasy participants by placing them simultaneously in large quantities of players. Conventional fantasy tournament providers have consistently struggled with the quantity of players that should simultaneously compete against one another. The traditional solution has always been to allow players to compete against fewer players at once if they are willing to pay a higher entry fee. For example it might cost 100 to be able to compete in a pool of as little as 500 players simultaneously as opposed to going against 5 000 people all at once for 5. These pools of people in traditional fantasy tournaments create two competing realities that make these tournaments problematic because these tournaments involve gaming features that are diametrically opposed to one another. The first reality is that to offer a huge prize the traditional tournament must have lots of people entering the tournament or the tournament cannot generate the necessary revenue to offer a large cash prize. Thus the first reality of traditional fantasy tournaments is to entice lots of people to enter the tournament. On the other hand the second reality of traditional fantasy tournaments creates a different dynamic. Because the strategy to weed players out has always been to place them in large pools of participants the players themselves are concerned about playing too many people at one time. To address this reality tournament organizers have taken the path of capping pools of players by offering guaranteed player pools of fewer people if players are willing to pay more money which also happens to violate the low entry fee requirement that makes the ideal format flourish. In other words the second reality of traditional fantasy tournaments is to put limits on the numbers of people who can enter the tournament as a strategy to appease the players. These conflicting realities have created significant problems in conventional tournament formats. The reality is that these traditional tournaments are always capped and usually no more than 300 000 to 400 000 people can enter. This is a disaster if the goal is to have an entry fee of 5 or less because the most a tournament can collect in entry fees is 2 million dollars. In contrast the fantasy tournament format as disclosed herein allows for over 2.1 billion entries.

Player skill has never been a factor in any past or current examples of low entry fee and high dollar reward fantasy sports tournaments. The reason is that every single example ever offered has had at least one trap round where the chance of a player advancing to a next round is less than 1 . A trap round is where participants are placed together in such large numbers that a random participant has less than a 1 mathematical chance to advance. In essence a trap round creates a lottery which negates the skill level of the players competing. A tournament based on pure luck is less desirable for players who are seeking a skill based tournament. The tournament format as disclosed herein avoids this problem by using the RINGS feature as described herein. The RINGS feature as disclosed herein combines small group play over multiple rounds. No traditional fantasy sports tournament has ever used this process.

The various example embodiments described herein are skill based tournament formats. The tournament formats described herein avoid trap rounds where the chance of a player advancing to a next round is less than 1 . The tournament formats described herein provide a high stakes tournament that provides players a reasonable chance to advance at least 10 at any given time so that skill actually is a factor in the competition. All previous attempts of large scale fantasy sports tournaments of 100 000 or more entries had at least one trap round in the tournament where a player had less than a 1 chance to advance.

The various embodiments described herein allow simultaneous entries from the same fantasy player in Tier 1 i.e. the qualifying portion of the tournament . The only way a tournament can generate the kind of revenue necessary to offer a high dollar prize for a low entry fee is to allow multiple entries by the same person to be played simultaneously. The only way that this can be done effectively is to create a submission process that doesn t take a lot of time like drafting players or studying salary caps. In an example embodiment a process is used that penalizes competitors for duplication through a blind submission process. This is the most effective way to avoid a draft and salary caps.

The various embodiments described herein also allow re entry at any point in Tier 1. This feature is an important part of a particular embodiment. In order for a low entry fee tournament to flourish there must be processes provided that allow contestants to enter the tournament at any time in Tier 1 for the same low entry fee. This is a necessary component to continue generating the revenue required to support a low entry fee and a high dollar grand prize tournament. The difficulty lies in providing ways for contestants entering late in Tier 1 to still have a chance to get in but also cover the same amount of ground that contestants in earlier stages of Tier 1 had to cover. The only way to accomplish this is to employ the RINGS feature as described herein. In particular a tournament can offer multiple RINGS within the same day. An example embodiment of the tournament structure that supports rings to enable various related methods is described herein.

Daily fantasy sports games are extremely popular. In a particular embodiment the Scrambles and RINGS concepts as disclosed herein can be integrated into a daily fantasy sports game format. For example a particular embodiment can offer a pre determined 10 round Scramble where each new round occurs the next day of a given sports season. Winning players could either cash out after a given round or let their winnings ride until the next round. Fantasy players who finish in the top predetermined positions would be considered winners and then could either cash out or decide to go to the next round where their money could be doubled as an example for finishing in a top position again.

In another example embodiment a National Fantasy Sports Certification System can be implemented. Conventional fantasy sports tournaments have never provided a system for fantasy sports certification where people who play fantasy sports are ranked and certified like they can be in other activities such as martial arts. A detailed description of an example embodiment of a fantasy sports certification system is provided next.

GOAT is an acronym for the Greatest of All Time . Every sport has its own version of who the GOAT is. Baseball has Babe Ruth. Hockey has Wayne Gretzky. Basketball has Michael Jordan. Soccer has Pele. Sometimes there is fierce debate. Is it Tiger Woods or Jack Nicklaus in golf Is it Jim Brown Joe Montana Jerry Rice or someone else in football In any event the GOAT for any sport is the pinnacle of what anyone could ever hope to be. It is what men and women in sports dream about. They idolize these great athletes because they would like to be them. This fantasy to be the GOAT can be used as a powerful trigger for players with respect to fantasy sports. Just like with GOAT athletes the ultimate goal for fantasy sports participants is to be recognized as great competitors maybe even the GOAT. Creating a structure in this manner allows participants to take on all kinds of roles that will fuel this concept to dizzying heights. Some players will be embarrassingly bad most will be mediocre some will be good even less will be great and just a handful will become elite. This is the type of system that can generate huge money if a fantasy sports implementation can be created around it. Such a fantasy sports implementation in an example embodiment is described herein.

In conventional fantasy sports formats there is no standardized way to evaluate whether someone who plays fantasy sports is really any good or not. When some player brags that s he has won his her fantasy league three straight years is this really an accomplishment that should be respected or did the bragging player merely beat a bunch of low performing league players. Conventional fantasy sports formats create a culture where nobody really knows how good anybody else is. In an example embodiment described herein a fantasy sports system levels the playing field and provides a way to properly evaluate everyone who plays against a true standardized measuring system. Because fantasy football is the biggest fantasy sport on the market today the following example embodiment describes the levels of a fantasy football GOAT measuring system.

In the example embodiment disclosed herein GOAT Fantasy Football is a national certification process where fantasy football enthusiasts can accurately assess their skill level by comparing themselves to a uniform national standard. The GOAT system requires players to compete in national competitions so that they can be properly evaluated. For a low certification fee fantasy enthusiasts can have their GOAT level calculated. In a particular embodiment the process can be similar to the way martial artists use a progression of belts to distinguish the skill level of a given individual. However unlike the martial art belt method the GOAT system of a particular embodiment does not guarantee that players will advance if they just put in the time. In the GOAT system of a particular embodiment if players do not perform well they will not progress. If they perform well they will be rewarded with advancement. If they are great they might one day be recognized as the GOAT of fantasy football. Fantasy football players in the example embodiment who don t like their GOAT level can always re apply as often as they like.

The fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment can generate a GOAT Certification for anyone who plays fantasy football or any other fantasy sport . At every fantasy football draft in the country it will become a requirement for any serious player to publicly reveal their GOAT Certification level to their group. Poorly rated players will be unlikely to receive priority in the draft. Excellent players will be revered as they should be and will be likely to receive priority in the draft. An individual player s GOAT level will always be present on their certification profile over the Internet for anyone to quickly access at any time. People who aren t enrolled and don t have a profile because they have never attempted to be certified with a ranking will be unlikely to receive the opportunities in a fantasy sports event that GOAT certified players will receive.

The fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment is the first process ever created that allows tens of millions of people to be evaluated at one time that can also accurately gauge skill level. That is because the ranking process is done in small groups or head to head. Small group competitions can involve for example 12 people competing against one another with only the top 3 advancing to a new GOAT level.

In an example embodiment there are 9 different GOAT levels with the 9th level being the highest or GOAT level which is comparable to a black belt in martial arts. Once a player makes a level the player retains the level for life. It is possible that a player might try to re certify for a higher level and do worse than the player s current level. However in the example embodiment the player will not be penalized and will retain the highest level achieved. The various GOAT measuring levels in an example embodiment are described in more detail below.

In the fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment the goal is to create an extremely difficult challenge to become a GOAT but at the same time make it achievable in a way that many people will become GOATS. This will fuel the masses to do whatever it takes to make it because they will see many who have done it. The truth is though that over 99 of the people who play fantasy football will never achieve the level of GOAT because it is a 65 536 to 1 shot assuming we don t account for the talent level of individual players. Nevertheless the fantasy football GOAT measuring system of an example embodiment creates a plurality of levels based on the skill of the players and not merely on random luck. As such the players are more motivated to try to move up the GOAT levels and willing to pay fees to take the chance. The odds of a typical player achieving a ranking at each of the GOAT levels described above are set forth below.

In an example embodiment national tournaments are held for only GOAT certified players. The national tournaments occur after the NFL regular season is over and are held during the NFL playoffs. GOAT certified players can compete against one another using a one on one single elimination format like the NCAA basketball tournament . GOAT players can compete to achieve any of a plurality of degrees of GOAT. In the example embodiment there are ten degrees of GOAT. The higher the GOAT degree the more revered the GOAT player will be in the pantheon of fantasy football players.

Once a person earns the title of GOAT as described above the GOAT player will continually be invited back to GOAT only tournaments to improve on their GOAT degree. Also winners of GOAT tournaments will not only be recognized as a 10th degree GOAT but they will also be recognized with a goat horn. This goat horn will be treasured the same way bracelets get treasured for wins on the World Poker Tour or rings get valued for winning championships in team sports or belts for boxing and MMA. The elite GOAT players will battle it out to see who can accumulate the most GOAT horns so that they can be recognized as the true GOAT in the history of fantasy football. This whole special GOAT club that only plays each other will motivate the non GOAT players to attempt to join this exclusive club.

Example embodiments of the tournament structure described herein can also support additional features and formats including 1 Multiple rounds in one day and 2 a Let It Ride format. These features of an example embodiment are described below.

Multiple Rounds in One Day The following process is a way to allow fantasy contestants to play several rounds in one day without breaking games up into separate rounds. This example is for a situation where 10 rounds are needed to be played in a single day for a tournament that is played in groups of 12 with the top 3 advancing. The format can be modified to accommodate a set number of rounds group size and advancing contestants needed for a given day of play.

Let it Ride This is a daily fantasy sports concept where contestants can play in a group format structure for as many rounds that they desire unless the tournament organizer establishes a maximum number of rounds . At the end of each round the contestant can decide whether they want to collect their money or let it carry over to another round where they will get an even bigger prize if they finish in winning positions for example finishing in the top 3 out of their group of 12 for a structure that declares the first three positions as winning spots .

Bid well or take a Scrub Athletes are split into two groups for each position. Each position group contains half of all available athletes. The top 50 of athletes based on weekly fantasy point average will be in a pool to be bid on. Contestants will select an athlete for each position and submit a percentage bid 1 to 100 of fantasy points they are willing to settle for each athlete they select. If they have the lowest bid they receive that athlete in their starting lineup if ties happen all tied people get that athlete for what they bid . Contestants who did not win a bid for a given position will be assigned a random field athlete at 100 of their fantasy value. This athlete can only come from the lower ranked athletes in bottom 50 who are not allowed to be bid on.

Example embodiments of the tournament structure described herein can be further illustrated by various particular examples of the various formats described herein. These examples of various embodiments are described below.

This fantasy football tournament is specifically designed for all four weeks of the NFL playoffs. The intent is to have a large chain of casinos host a tournament on several of their sites during the first weekend of the NFL playoffs and then shift to one location for the remainder of the postseason. This chain of casinos can invite up to 6 250 of their highest rollers to partake in this six round tournament that spans four weeks. The number of contestants involved at any given time is as follows 

The following are the highest possible bids allowed for each round in the bidding process in an example embodiment 

The last fantasy player without a bloc of three gets this group automatically at a highest possible bid of 55 .

The final match is played between the last two standing during the Super Bowl. It is the only round not contested using group play. The match should implement the same fantasy scoring format that was used during the first five rounds. The number of athletes each contestant has in their lineup and the manner in which they are selected will change though. The Super Bowl selection format is as follows 

The third weekend of the NFL playoffs consists of the two conference championship games. By this point the Bidding Gauntlet tournament has only ten contestants remaining. Since so few contestants remain it creates the perfect opportunity to invite eliminated high rollers as well as new invitees back to play some more fantasy football. This new offering will occur at six different locations and will consist of a fast paced Fantasy Eliminator competition. This tournament can accommodate up to 7 776 contestants.

The tournament is broken into five rounds. For each of the five rounds contestants are placed in groups of 6. The object is for contestants to win their group of 6 to advance to the next round. During the final round which is played on Super Bowl Sunday the six remaining players compete for cash prizes during the Big Game.

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept of playing multiple rounds in one day by submitting one lineup that will be used for two or more groups. Each group this lineup is submitted for will be considered a separate and distinct round. The rounds will be numerically sequenced and the lowest numbered round for which the contestant does not meet the criteria to advance will be considered the round in which they were eliminated.

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept of bidding on fantasy athletes in blocs of two or more by bidding for a percentage of their fantasy points that they score. For example if three athletes are bid on at 94 this means that if the bid is a winning bid these three athletes are all secured for the contestant and the contestant will receive 94 of the fantasy points that each athlete scores for the round.

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept of decreasing or increasing the maximum allowable bid for an athlete s fantasy points for a given round of bidding. For example for a seven round bidding format the highest allowable bid might decrease in increments of 7 for each passing round.

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept of eliminating one or more contestants during a round for not having met a certain point threshold or for being ranked at or near the bottom of a grouping of contestants when the time period is up. This is called Fantasy Eliminator .

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept where contestants can play in a daily fantasy sports group format structure for as many rounds as they desire unless the tournament organizer establishes a maximum number of rounds . At the end of each round the contestant can decide whether they want to collect their money or let it carry over to another round where they will get an even bigger prize if they finish in winning positions for example finishing in the top 3 out of their group of 12 for a structure that declares the first three positions as winning spots .

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept of Minimum Threshold for a group of contestants. This means that contestants must meet a minimum threshold to advance to the next round and that the remaining contestants in the group or field are eliminated. The eliminated contestants must always exceed the number of advancing contestants. In other words the eliminated participants must always represent more than 50 of the field of contestants at any given time. This implies that a group of contestants must finish in a predetermined position compared to the rest of the field to advance. For example it could be determined that the top 30 of the scores advance meaning that the bottom 70 do not advance . This method can involve a small group of less than 10 contestants all the way up to a large group totaling in the thousands or millions.

As described herein for various example embodiments an embodiment can support the concept of Slotting Positions with a Percentage Value . This is where a contestant submits a lineup and ranks the athletes in order of preference because the order in which they are ranked determines the fantasy point value for a given athlete. For example the top slated athlete a contestant submits might be worth 100 of the fantasy points that they score the second slotted athlete might receive 95 of their fantasy points that they score the third slotted athlete 90 etc.

Referring now to in the example embodiment the fantasy player selections for contestant Vicktorious Secret are shown. In this example each fantasy player s value is denoted by a percentage score shown in the Percent column illustrated in . The lower the percentage the more duplication has occurred for the corresponding fantasy player and the less their fantasy points are worth. This is because the percentage shown literally represents the percentage of the fantasy points a contestant receives based on the actual fantasy points their athlete scores. For example this percentage of points that the owner of the Vicktorious Secret team gets to keep for each one of their athletes in this example is denoted in the Fantasy Points display area under the heading of Percent as shown in . In that same Fantasy Points display area the number of fantasy points allocated before an adjustment is made is denoted under the Base column. This column represents the number of points that a given athlete scored in their real life fantasy sports contest. The adjusted fantasy point total is denoted under the Actual column. These values are determined by multiplying the points a given athlete scored by the percentage that the fantasy player is worth for a given contestant.

Referring now to and sample user interface screenshots depict how an example embodiment of the fantasy sports tournament as described herein can enable a plurality of contestants to compete in the same contest at the same time. In particular the example embodiment can enable two or more contestants three or more contestants or many contestants to compete among each other in the same contest or round at the same time. The fantasy sports tournament contestants in an example embodiment can be placed together in a small group and allowed to compete in the same group among all members of the group at the same time. The gaming system of the example embodiment can run a plurality of small groups at the same time. Thus the tournament can be partitioned into a plurality of small groups wherein each small group can comprise a plurality e.g. two or more or three or more etc. of contestants in each group where the contestants in each group play among all members of the same group at the same time. Conventional tournament systems do not provide this capability. As shown in and the sample screenshots illustrate an example round in the fantasy sports tournament of an example embodiment where more than two teams contestants can compete among each other in the same contest at the same time. and illustrate an example where there are twelve contestants competing against one another in the current round of the tournament at the same time. The final scores for each contestant are tabulated to the nearest hundredth and shown to the right of the name of the corresponding contestant. In this sample case the top three contestants advance to the next round of the tournament while the bottom nine contestants are eliminated. This sample competition shows that the top three finishers in this example contest were Vicktorious Secret ODB and Just Beat Roger. Thus the gaming system of an example embodiment enables small group competitions among multiple contestants at the same time. These examples illustrate how the various embodiments disclosed herein run counter to the traditional thinking that contestants must be paired in one on one matches like they are in real life sports where one team plays against another team as they do in baseball basketball hockey football soccer etc. This novel approach provided by the example embodiments disclosed herein enables multiple contestants to compete against each other in the same round at the same time and enables the top finishers in the round to advance to the next round. As such the various embodiments described herein provide a fantasy sports tournament structure that has not existed before.
