title: Method for routing transactions between internal and external partners in a communication center
abstract: In a multimedia call center (MMCC) operating through an operating system, a client-specific self-help wizard is provided for active clients and updated periodically with information related to client transaction history with the MMCC. A connected client is presented by the wizard with a selective media function through which the client may a select a media type for interaction and help, and the MMCC will then re-contact the client through the selected media. The client, for example, may select IP or COST telephony, and the MMCC will place a call to the client to a number or IP address listed for the client, and interactivity will then be through an interactive voice response unit. Help information specific to a client is updated in the client's wizard periodically according to ongoing transaction history with the MMCC. The wizard may also monitor client activity with the wizard and make reports available to various persons.

The present invention is in the field of telecommunication encompassing all existing sorts of interaction multimedia technology and pertains more particularly to methods and apparatus for providing media independent self help modules presented as part of a customer interface associated with a multimedia communication center.

In the field of telephony communication there have been many improvements in technology over the years that have contributed to more efficient use of telephone communication within hosted call center environments. Most of these improvements involve integrating the telephones and switching systems in such call centers with computer hardware and software adapted for among other things better routing of telephone calls faster delivery of telephone calls and associated information and improved service with regard to client satisfaction. Such computer enhanced telephony is known in the art as computer telephony integration CTI .

Generally speaking CTI implementations of various design and purpose are implemented both within individual call centers and in some cases at the telephone network level. For example processors running CTI software applications may be linked to telephone switches service control points SCPs and network entry points within a public or private telephone network. At the call center level CTI enhanced processors data servers transaction servers and the like are linked to telephone switches and in some cases to similar CTI hardware at the network level often by a dedicated digital link. CTI processors and other hardware within a call center is commonly referred to as customer premises equipment CPE . It is the CTI processor and application software is such centers that provides computer enhancement to a call center.

In a CTI enhanced call center telephones at agent stations are connected to a central telephony switching apparatus such as an automatic call distributor ACD switch or a private branch exchange PBX . The agent stations may also be equipped with computer terminals such as personal computer video display unit s PC VDU s so that agents manning such stations may have access to stored data as well as being linked to incoming callers by telephone equipment. Such stations may be interconnected through the PC VDUs by a local area network LAN . One or more data or transaction servers may also be connected to the LAN that interconnects agent stations. The LAN is in turn typically connected to the CTI processor which is connected to the call switching apparatus of the call center.

When a call arrives at a call center whether or not the call has been pre processed at an SCP typically at least the telephone number of the calling line is made available to the receiving switch at the call center by the network provider. This service is available by most networks as caller ID information in one of several formats such as Automatic Number Identification ANI . Typically the number called is also available through a service such as Dialed Number Identification Service DNIS . If the call center is computer enhanced CTI the phone number of the calling party may be used as a key to access additional information from a customer information system CIS database at a server on the network that connects the agent workstations. In this manner information pertinent to a call may be provided to an agent often as a screen pop on the agent s PC VDU.

In recent years advances in computer technology telephony equipment and infrastructure have provided many opportunities for improving telephone service in publicly switched and private telephone intelligent networks. Similarly development of a separate information and data network known as the Internet together with advances in computer hardware and software have led to a new multimedia telephone system known in the art by several names. In this new systemology telephone calls are simulated by multimedia computer equipment and data such as audio data is transmitted over data networks as data packets. In this system the broad term used to describe such computer simulated telephony is Data Network Telephony DNT .

For purposes of nomenclature and definition the inventors wish to distinguish clearly between what might be called conventional telephony which is the telephone service enjoyed by nearly all citizens through local telephone companies and several long distance telephone network providers and what has been described herein as computer simulated telephony or data network telephony. The conventional systems are referred to herein as Connection Oriented Switched Telephony COST systems CTI enhanced or not.

The computer simulated or DNT systems are familiar to those who use and understand computers and data network systems. Perhaps the best example of DNT is telephone service provided over the Internet which will be referred to herein as Internet Protocol Network Telephony IPNT by far the most extensive but still a subset of DNT.

Both systems use signals transmitted over network links. In fact connection to data networks for DNT such as IPNT is typically accomplished over local telephone lines used to reach points in the network such as an Internet Service Provider ISP . The definitive difference is that COST telephony may be considered to be connection oriented telephony. In the COST system calls are placed and connected by a specific dedicated path and the connection path is maintained over the time of the call. Bandwidth is basically assured. Other calls and data do not share a connected channel path in a COST system. A DNT system on the other hand is not dedicated or connection oriented. That is data including audio data is prepared sent and received as data packets over a data network. The data packets share network links and may travel by varied and variable paths.

Recent improvements to available technologies associated with the transmission and reception of data packets during real time DNT communication have enabled companies to successfully add DNT principally IPNT capabilities to existing CTI call centers. Such improvements as described herein and known to the inventor include methods for guaranteeing available bandwidth or quality of service QoS for a transaction improved mechanisms for organizing coding compressing and carrying data more efficiently using less bandwidth and methods and apparatus for intelligently replacing lost data via using voice supplementation methods and enhanced buffering capabilities.

In addition to Internet protocol IPNT calls a DNT center may also share other forms of media with customers accessing the system through their computers. E mails Video mails fax file share file transfer video calls and so forth are some of the other forms of media which may be used. This capability of handling varied media leads to the term multimedia communications center. A multimedia communications center may be a combination CTI and DNT center or may be a DNT center capable of receiving COST calls and converting them to a digital DNT format. The term communication center will replace the term call center hereinafter in this specification when referring to multimedia capabilities.

In typical communication centers DNT is accomplished by Internet connection and IPNT calls. For this reason IPNT and the Internet will be used in examples to follow. IT should be understood however that this usage is exemplary and not limiting.

In systems known to the inventors incoming IPNT calls are processed and routed within an IPNT capable communication center in much the same way as COST calls are routed in a CTI enhanced call center using similar or identical routing rules waiting queues and so on aside from the fact that there are two separate networks involved. Communication centers having both CTI and IPNT capability utilize LAN connected agent stations with each station having a telephony switch connected headset or phone and a PC connected in most cases via LAN to the network carrying the IPNT calls. Therefore in most cases IPNT calls are routed to the agent s PC while conventional telephony calls are routed to the agent s conventional telephone or headset. Typically separate lines and equipment must be implemented for each type of call weather COST or IPNT.

Due in part to added costs associated with additional equipment lines and data ports that are needed to add IPNT capability to a CTI enhanced call center companies are currently experimenting with various forms of integration between the older COST system and the newer IPNT system. For example by enhancing data servers interactive voice response units IVR s agent connecting networks and so on with the capability of conforming to Internet protocol call data arriving from either network may be integrated requiring less equipment and lines to facilitate processing storage and transfer of data.

With many new communication products supporting various media types available to businesses and customers a communication center must add significant application software to accommodate the diversity. For example e mail programs have differing parameters than do IP applications. IP applications are different regarding protocol than COST calls and so on. Separate routing systems and or software components are needed for routing e mails IP calls COST calls file sharing etc. Agents must then be trained in the use of a variety of applications supporting the different types of media.

Keeping contact histories reporting statistics creating routing rules and the like becomes more complex as newer types of media are added to communication center capability. Additional hardware implementations such as servers processors etc. are generally required to aid full multimedia communication and reporting. Therefore it is desirable that interactions of all multimedia sorts be analyzed recorded and routed according to enterprise business rules in a manner that provides seamless integration between media types and application types thereby allowing agents to respond intelligently and efficiently to customer queries and problems.

A challenge that is paramount to any enterprise dealing with a large customer base concerns empowering customers to make informed decisions without necessarily committing a live agent or other precious resources to assist those customers. For example it is desired that a customer configures his or her product order or perhaps answers his or her own questions without substantial assistance. In this way agents are free to handle other issues or problems that may arise during an active work period.

The most successful technology for empowering customers through interface is practiced on the well known Internet. In this case an interactive WEB page sometimes known as a WEB form is provided by an enterprise as a customer interfacing mechanism. A WEB page author typically adds interactive function to the page according to conventions that are well known in the art such as through Java or COM technology. Such conventions may include the use of knowledge base technology and other WEB connected resources maintained for the purpose of aiding customers. Such inclusion of WEB connected resource is provided via object linking typically to another WEB page containing a requested information source. In this way a user may interact with such conventions thereby obtaining more information effecting a product order and so on. Typical conventions include banner links on line order forms frequently asked question FAQ lists product presentation interactives PPI and so on. In the case of using knowledge base technology for configuring more complicated orders downloading of an application tool kit to a user s computer is generally required.

Another well known convention used to empower customers is commonly referred to as a self help wizard. A self help wizard is a software application that is typically loaded on or downloaded to a user s computer along with a related software application usually purchased by the user. Self help wizards enable a user to configure downloaded applications installation customize software components initiate execution of accessory applications or special projects. Conventional self help wizards such as the type accompanying downloaded software are limited however in that they are typically general in descriptive content and are often difficult to use effectively. These types of self help applications are designed and intended for use on one s computer after download. Such wizards often have links to WEB sourced information that is accessed through an Internet dialing function generic to the user s system.

A multimedia communication center operating an operating system such as CINOS according to disclosure provided in the patent application or included by reference in various embodiments provides and maintains various customer interface options including WEB forms. In a system known to the inventor a customer interfacing window is provided as a COM based module presented in such a WEB form or as a CTI application in a COST environment such as may be used in conjunction with an IVR. This enables the enterprise to keep track of potential and existing customers and to control selected media options for new customers existing customers and business associates. However it is desired that a customer or business associate accessing CINOS through a WEB page be able to solve problems and resolve issues specific to his or her business with the enterprise without taxing resource of the enterprise.

In the CINOS system known to the inventor customer access points are controlled in a fashion that general telephony ordering options media options and the like are made available for connection to live attendants as well as to automated systems for the purpose of qualifying customers and effecting further routine business with the enterprise. However once a customer for example has committed to purchasing goods or services with the enterprise it is desired that he or she is able to obtain any specific product or issue related assistance in a manner so as not to tax enterprise personnel.

What is clearly needed is a method and apparatus for providing a media independent self help wizard that is accessible and executable from within a customer interfacing WEB form or customer interfacing window that is programmable according to enterprise rules and objectives. Such a method and apparatus would allow a customer to solve specific product or service related problems without taxing enterprise resource. In addition connected resources such as IVR and other automated services covering a wide variety of offered system supported media could be made accessible through such a module.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention in a multimedia communication center MMCC a client self help system is provided comprising an operating system OS including an outward facing communication interface for accepting communications from clients and for presenting a display for a connected client an interactive self help wizard model presented in a graphic interface in the display and configured to a selected client and a media selection interface presented in the graphic interface by which the connected client may select a particular media for receiving help and indicate the nature of help desired. The self help wizard is periodically automatically updated in available information according to client transaction history with the enterprise.

In some embodiments the self help wizard model is accessible and programmable by a worker connected by a computerized workstation to the MMCC. Also in preferred embodiments the media open to client selection includes WEB interface e mail interactive voice response facsimile reception and downloading of video documents. By selection of a media type the client may initiate a call back in the media selected to a client apparatus compatible with the media selected. By selecting COST or IP telephony the system places a call by an Interactive Voice Response IVR unit to the client through a telephone number or IP address listed for the client and the IVR then interacts with the client to provide specific help to the client.

In some embodiments an ordering function is provided tailored to a client providing an ordering interface for parts and services relating to recently acquired enterprise products by the client. There may also be a reporting function wherein the reporting function monitors client activity related to the wizard and makes that activity available to an enterprise agent through the OS.

In another aspect of the invention a method for providing self directed aid to clients of an enterprise hosted multimedia call center MMCC is provided comprising steps of a configuring a graphic self help wizard interface including a media selection function for a selected client associated with the enterprise and presenting the wizard in a graphic display to a connected client b updating the wizard with information periodically according to client transaction history with the enterprise and c establishing an interactive communication with the client in the media selected in step a whereby updated information my be provided to the client. In some embodiments there may be a step included for programming the wizard by an enterprise worker. In step a media available through the media selection may includes WEB interface e mail interactive voice response facsimile reception and downloading of video documents. By selection of a media type the client initiates a call back in the media selected to a client apparatus compatible with the media selected. For example by selecting either COST or IP telephony the system places a call by an Interactive Voice Response IVR unit to the client through a telephone number or IP address listed for the client and the IVR then interacts with the client to provide specific help to the client.

In some embodiments of the method further steps provide an ordering function tailored to a client providing an ordering interface for parts and services relating to recently acquired enterprise products by the client. In these and other embodiments there may also be a step for monitoring client activity with the wizard and making that activity available to an enterprise agent through the OS.

In embodiments of the invention for the first time in a multimedia call center an effective means is provided specific to enterprise clients allowing clients to obtain highly selective help according to recently acquired products and or services without unduly loading personnel of the call center and without requiring clients to wait for scarce resources.

In this particular embodiment communication center handles both conventional telephone calls which may be categorized as connection oriented switched telephony COST calls and data network telephony DNT calls which may be DNT calls over a private digital network or calls according to a protocol such as the well known Internet protocol. DNT calls are characterized in that data is transmitted as addressed data packets as opposed to dedicated connections in COST calls. As indicated PSTN may be a private rather than a public network. WAN may be a company Intranet the Internet or another type of WAN known in the art. The particular method of call delivery and call center integration is not particularly relevant for the purposes of this invention. There are many ways known both to the inventor as well as known in the art. Particular issues discussed in the disclosure between the telephones and the computers might be implemented differently depending on the actual system but shall be deemed equivalent for all purposes of this invention.

Incoming COST calls arrive at a network level telephony switching apparatus in network cloud and are connected over trunk to a central telephony switching apparatus within communication center . From switching apparatus calls are routed according to existing routing rules over internal wiring to agents telephones and residing at agents workstations and respectively.

Incoming DNT calls and other communication events such as e mail file transfers and the like arrive at a routing node in WAN and are passed on over digital connection to a routing server within communication center . Once calls arrive at server they may in some embodiments be routed directly over LAN according to existing routing rules to personal computer video display units PC VDU such as PC VDU or located at agent s workstations and respectively.

In this embodiment switch connected telephones are also connected to PC VDU s via a headset to computer sound card according to technique known to the inventor and accomplished via an I O cable. Thus connected agents may respond to incoming COST and DNT calls with the same headset.

In the exemplary system and communication center shown the equipment and applications are adapted to provide for multimedia operation at each of the agent stations so the agents can interact with clients in many different ways as are known in the multimedia arts.

Computer telephony integration CTI enhancement is in this embodiment provided both at communication center and in PSTN . For example in PSTN a processor running instances of a CTI application known as a T server TS to the inventors and a statistics server Stat is connected to telephony switch via CTI link . An intelligent peripheral of the form of an interactive voice response unit IVR is connected to processor via data connection . Similar CTI equipment is illustrated within communication center . Namely a processor running instances of TS and Stat and connected to telephony switch via CTI link and an IVR connected to processor via a data connection with processor further connected to a local area network LAN within communication center .

In alternative embodiments there may also be a CTI processor in WAN connected to server by a CTI link . Also in some embodiments a separate data network connects these CTI processors. In this way intelligent routing may be performed at the network level with negotiation and direction from within communication center .

It will be appreciated by those with skill in the art that the CTI enhancements as immediately described above may be hosted on one processor at PSTN and on one processor at communication center without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The inventor has chosen to show separate processors having separate functions for exemplary purposes only. It will also be appreciated by the skilled artisan that there may be many more or fewer than the four agent stations shown in communications center and hardware and software arrangements may be made is a variety of ways. Also home agents might be connected in a variety of ways to the call center.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a customer interaction network operating system hereinafter termed CMOS is provided for the purpose of managing communications center and optimizing and recording all agent customer interactions received at communication center from networks and . CINOS is unique in the fact that it is a multi tiered object and process orientated system wherein logic regarding the various aspects of it s functionality is achieved via knowledge based architecture and object modeling. Various functions of CINOS more fully described below include capturing recording analyzing routing and in many instances responding via automated process to customers engaged in interactions with the enterprise company hosting the communication center . CINOS is adapted to support all planned communication mediums such as multimedia DNT applications including e mail video mail file transfers chat sessions IP calls and CTI COST transactions such as voice calls voice mails faxes and so on.

Referring back to CINOS utilizes various LAN connected machines in order to perform various operations. Among these various hardware implementations are a multimedia server MIS adapted to physically store and serve all multimedia transactions and a customer information system server CIS adapted to physically store and serve information relevant to customers such as purchase history financial status product preferences contact information etc. A central server COS acts as a host location for a CINOS manager application noted in text balloon which is in effect the parent application that controls all of the operation and functionality of the system.

In addition to the above mentioned machines hosting CINOS routines each PC VDU such as PC VDU for example has a CINOS agent desktop interface or client application not shown adapted to interact with the parent application. Also each machine that provides particular dedicated function to communication center such as switch connected CTI processors IVR s and other related equipment host instances of CINOS application program interfaces API s to enable seamless integration of differing parameters and or protocols that are used with various planned application and media types utilized within communication center . Such programs may also co reside or be in any combination or hosted by themselves. Additionally for performance purposes additional dedicated network links may exist between those servers but essentially they are only performance boosters and hence for clarity purposes only a simple network is shown.

As previously described CINOS comprises a multi tiered architecture. This unique architecture comprises an external media layer for interfacing with the customer or business contact a workflow layer for making routing decisions organizing automated responses recording transactions and so on and an internal media later for interfacing and presenting interactions to an agent or knowledge worker. An innovative concept associated with CINOS involves the use of tooled process models knowledge bases and other object models as base instruction for it s various functions. These modular conventions may be inter bound with each other and are easily editable providing a customizable framework that may conform to virtually any existing business logic.

In simple operation and after any network level routing COST calls and DNT calls including other media events arrive at communication center to telephony switch and routing server respectively. Network level routing as defined herein includes any intelligent implementation that may be in place and aided via processors and . Load balancing to multiple communication centers and transferring customer data obtained at network level over data network connection would be examples of such network level routing.

Once a call or other communication event registers at either switch or routing server CINOS immediately identifies the media type associated with the call and begins it s processes depending on enterprise rules. For example a live COST call may first be routed to IVR whereby the customer can be presented with varying choices such as leaving a voice message waiting in queue receiving a call back or perhaps an e mail and so on. Interaction by IVR in this instance will preferably be via voice recognition technique such as is known in the art but may also be via touch tone response or other known method. As previously described the caller may elect from a number of options such as to hold for a next available agent select an automated response such as a fax back or perhaps a later agent initiated response such as an e mail or call back. In all cases CINOS seamlessly processes and executes the logic required to accomplish the goal of the caller in a media and application independent fashion.

DNT events are handled much the same way as described above for live callers. For example an IP call may be routed to a digital equivalent of an IVR for interaction or queued for a next available agent and so on. In one embodiment IVR may be adapted to handle both COST and DNT interaction.

All interactions with live external media including actual text based events whether live or not are recorded and stored in MIS with an associated text version of the media stored as well and becoming part of an overall threaded contact history. This is accomplished in varying ways according to existing parameters such as media type whether the event is a live call and so on. For example CINOS may execute a command directing IVR to digitally record an incoming COST call during customer interaction and then store the voice recording of the transaction in MIS . A text version of the recording either created simultaneously from the voice recording via voice to text techniques known in the art or created by a live attendant via manual annotation may be sent to and stored in DB . An IPNT call arriving at routing server may be similarly recorded and stored in MIS with an associated text version of the interaction stored in DB . E mails video calls voice mails and so on are similarly handled. For example an incoming e mail is stored in MIS server while text from the e mail may be extracted and stored associated with the e mail.

The purpose of the text version of the event is twofold. Firstly a complete text based transaction history of communication center may be compiled and reserved for later access and audit. Secondly an agent or knowledge worker may in some instances see the text version of the event at the same time that he receives routed notification of the event. In this way an agent may begin mental preparation before taking a call. The text version of an event must be machine readable and human readable at times displayed. Interactive media independent viewers part of the agent s client application may be used to disseminate information which may initially not be human readable.

It is important to note here that the text based version of an event may or may not be a complete and verbatim rendition of an actual media event. For example an e mail may contain many documents each having many pages of text. Therefore the text based version of a particular e mail event may simply contain the name and particulars regarding the author a purchase order and a list of the enclosed documents by title and basic content or memo as well as a possible manual annotation. The attachments to the e mail may be stored separately and be also cross indexed and retrievable. Seeing the purchase order when the event is routed to an agent desktop tells the agent that this e mail is important.

A fax stored originally as a bit mapped document may be converted to text in the system via optical recognition OCR technique wherein sometimes only certain content such as the authors contact information basic intent of the fax and perhaps special numbers or codes contained in the original fax are recorded in a text version sometimes the whole text is OCR d while the original fax is stored in it s entirety in DB . Such codes or numbers that are specifically parsed from actual media may be part of a unique coding system set up by the enterprise whereby customers are directed to include such codes or numbers with their orders service requests and so on.

Parsing text messages is accomplished via a text analyzer known to the inventor. In other non text media types such as video or graphics descriptive notes may be taken via live attendant and stored in DB as previously mentioned. Voice recognition technology may also be used in a case of recorded sound or video with sound. All transactions regardless of media type are thus recorded and stored according to enterprise rules with at least a meaningful part of the content if not all of the content of such transactions converted to text and stored in DB associated with the recording of the event. Again the importance of the text version is that the extracted knowledge of the transaction therein is in machine operable code allowing search and cross referencing functions that may otherwise not be possible.

After incoming events are analyzed and processed with regards to queuing recording storing etc. CINOS decides the disposition paths of each event. For example live calls in queue are routed to live agents if available if this is the priority action in the enterprise rules. E mails are either routed to next available agents using a push technology or simply stored in MIS server where they may be retrieved by agents after receiving notification. Recorded events such as IVR voice requests are stored in MIS server where they may be retrieved by agents and so on.

By the use of routing and routing notification events any media may be routed to an appropriate agent based on skill or any other rule based routing method over LAN . Actual multimedia events may be accessed from MIS server at the agent s discretion or by rule and text based versions of those events stored in DB may be mirrored and routed to the agent along with notification of the incoming event.

Other services may be performed by CINOS such as responding to media requests without agent participation via initiating automated fax responses out bound dialing campaigns wherein recorded information is given to a customer perhaps concerning an order placed by the customer and so on. Networking via business or chat applications between several business partners customers agents and so on is possible wherein each entry may be stored in DB as part of a discussion thread including responses of another media type perhaps initiated by a communication center agent to one of the participants during the discussion.

As a general rule full multimedia storage is done in a mass storage server and linked by cross indexing to the database. Depending on the business model full text or only partial annotation is stored in the database or a mix thereof e.g by media type.

In addition to supporting a wide variety of applications and protocol CINOS is provided with the tools for building media independent self help wizards that are adapted for problem solving and reduction. Similarly external and internal interaction media viewers are provided and adapted to support any media of choice.

CINOS uses object modeling and linking techniques that are known in the art to effect much of it s goal of presenting a seamless customer interaction with an enterprise agent or knowledge worker operating in a communication center such as center . For example an interaction object model IOM represents a transcript of all interaction history stored in DB and provides an audit trail of the state of transactions of all interactions. An interaction process model IPM controls how events are handled within the operating system.

An additional set of models handle how agents receive their routed media such as via traditional push model blended push model publish and subscribe model or interrupt model. Prioritizing interaction events may also be accomplished through varying the push theme or scheme. For example traditional push technology for e mail means that only e mail media type is being worked on by an agent. By blending the push model with a publish and subscribe model the interrupt model is created wherein the agent may subscribe to various routed media such as answering phones and responding to faxes but may be interrupted for an important interaction of another media type such as e mail and so on. In this way an agent s time may be utilized according to enterprise rules within an automated environment.

Outbound campaigns may be configured according to enterprise rules and media preference using a single rule set knowledge base. This single set of outbound tools can be used to initiate customer dialog via predictive dialing e mail push automated recorded messages and so on.

It will be apparent to those with skill in the art that common object modeling COM can be used to create virtually any type of model for any type of enterprise situation. It is the intention of the inventor to provide the applicable control codes known in the art for building process and object models and enabling the linking and interaction between the models. As previously described it is partly the fact that CINOS uses these various models and knowledge bases to achieve desired interaction that sets it above current art systems. The inventor knows of no such network interfacing operating system that is based on the above described technology.

CINOS may be implemented in a number of different topologies. For example CINOS may be implemented as a centralized topology with one communication center as shown here in a distributed topology wherein a single communication center may span multiple physical locations a segmented communication center wherein a single pool of agents services more than one company or customer base or a wide communication network wherein a plurality of communication centers such as center cooperatively service a common pool of customers or a customer base. Enterprises involved in commerce such as large financial institutions hosting many geographically separate communication centers may build their entire networking system using CINOS architecture in standardized and distributed fashion. There is no limitation to the type of enterprise that may use CINOS as it may be tooled to accommodate virtually any network architecture linked to a communication center having DNT capability.

It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art that CINOS routines according to various embodiments of the present invention may be included and implemented at the network level without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention such as in processor and IVR in PSTN or in routing node in WAN .

External media layer may in one embodiment be a multifaceted web based self help interface providing news information and a host of other services that may be personalized by the customer. In many respects external media layer in this embodiment is similar to a web browser.

Workflow layer comprises 3 basic function categories beginning with a content analysis category wherein textual analysis voice analysis IVR interaction recording and storing takes place. A next category is context resolution . Context resolution involves customer identification business process binding preparation for routing and so on. A third category termed interaction routing comprises various processes associated with the presentation of the interaction to agents service persons knowledge workers business partners customers and the like that is all transaction partners. Category covers queuing skill based routing automated treatment workflow models and so on.

Internal media layer comprises an agent desktop interface not shown in but described in more detail below. Both external layer and internal layer contain the required tools for enabling media and application independent interfacing such as previously mentioned self help wizards media viewers and other controls as prescribed via enterprise rules.

Internal media layer provides an agent with among other options information about the customer or contact information about current or historical business processes information about current interactions and their relationship to business processes and a knowledge base to guide the agent or knowledge worker with interaction response and workflow. An agent a and agent b and a knowledge worker c are shown herein interacting with the system as illustrated via bi directional arrows. The skilled artisan will recognize these are merely examples and there may be many more such persons and interactions in some instances may be routed to machines for response.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the multi tiered architecture of CINOS such as is illustrated herein may comprise many more or differing steps or processes without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

All transactions whether live calls such as video calls DNT calls and COST calls or text based documents such as e mails are recorded and stored in one or more mass storage devices handled by one or more database applications. This may be taken as server of although the diagram of is exemplary.

A principle object of the invention is to extract maximum information from every transaction for building a knowledge base that can be used for dynamic management and future analysis and development. This is done primarily by data mining which is applicable to machine operable code that is text. Because of the nature of the extraction there is a difference in the way live calls and text based media is handled.

Discrimination as to the text nature of the media is made at step . If the media chosen by the customer is already text based then the transaction is recorded as received and a data mining application extracts important information in step and stores it in the knowledge base. The distinct portions and versions of the transaction such as the originally recorded version and any extracted data are related to one another and to other knowledge previously stored and become part of a threaded interaction history associated with an ongoing interaction and ultimately of an overall contact history.

If the media chosen by the customer is determined in step to be a live interaction such as a COST or IPNT call then the existing knowledge base is accessed at step and the call is routed to the best fit agent. This may of course be done in a number of ways such as an ADC skill based routing as known to the inventors transfer to an IVR for automatic processing and so on as may be dictated by enterprise rules. If routing is to an agent customer information may be retrieved from CIS server and sent to the agent s PC and appropriate scripts may be provided to guide an agent in interacting with the caller.

In step the actual transaction is recorded as it takes place which in the case of live calls may be a video or an audio recording or a combination of both. Preferably the recording is digitized.

In step a maximal text version is prepared from the actual transaction. The ability to do so depends to a degree on the sophistication of the system. This process may be as simple as a person adding notes for annotation or as sophisticated as a voice to text application preparing a full text version as the transaction transpires.

In step the text version is mined for data and resulting knowledge is stored in the appropriate knowledge base for future use and added to overall record with appropriate cross referencing.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that there will be many routines comprising various steps for performing different processes as may be determined by enterprise rules which may likewise vary depending on among other considerations company type product and or service type communication center architecture whether or not the system architecture is centralized or distributed and so on. The embodiment taught herein is meant only as a basic example of process functionality related to CINOS processing of an incoming event.

An HTML client application oversees all of the network capability previously mentioned. In this embodiment for example HTML client communicates with an Internet information server using HTTP protocol which is standard. Client if provided minimally may be used in conjunction with an Internet browser for full multimedia function. In some embodiments it may be maximally provided to be a fully featured client with full web browser function. For example an agent may create and edit web forms web pages embed controls into such web based forms or pages to provide certain customer interaction mechanisms in addition to having a fully functional navigation tool at his disposal.

In another embodiment Server may be a server on a private network or corporate WAN instead of an Internet server. In a preferred embodiment however any number of servers on the Internet and or linked to a WAN other than the Internet may communicate with client as it intended to support all existing and known communication protocols.

A windows client is provided to seamlessly integrate existing applications on the agent s PC to network applications and processes. This may be implemented via a desktop tool kit that contains all of the required controls for building integrating and customizing the interface.

A business logic layer comprises business object models hereinafter termed business objects representing contacts interactions knowledge bases events routing processes and other system routines. Integration and interaction of the various described desktop components with these logics is accomplished via common object modeling COM which is known in the art and available to the inventor. Desktop to CTI integration is accomplished via controls provided or created with a CTI set of tools or tool kit not shown . For example if the enterprise desires to blend voice and e mail the CTI tool kit would be used to build and integrate the interface.

Existing network applications such as CIS enterprise resource planning ERP Commerce and the like interact with various business objects using COM and may also interact with a physical database using ODBC and SQL.

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention CINOS access by customers of an enhanced multimedia communication center such as center of is controlled by means of a customer facing media interface by which customers may be identified and even categorized according to numerous criteria. In some cases access may be controlled through subscription or according to other qualifying criteria such as may be deemed appropriate by the enterprise. For example if the enterprise is an exclusive investment club membership may be required. Categorizing criteria may include demographic information such as income level credit history or any other attribute that may be quantified and used to categorize a customer.

An enterprise controlled access point may be defined as an interfacing window or portal created and maintained at a typical customer entry point in a network as may be known in the art. Such interfaces may take the form of a WEB based customer interface a WEB page an interactive voice response IVR unit a service control point SCP or some other customer facing system or apparatus as may be known in the art.

For the purposes of this specification an example of an enterprise controlled WEB form access and interface window is illustrated as an example for a preferred embodiment. The inventor deems such an interface to be most adept in offering best fit media options while remaining accessible to a large customer or client base.

Window is built and edited using COM codes available to the inventor and typically found in tool kits adapted for the purpose of creating interactive displays on a WEB page. Such a tool kit may be located on an agent s desktop perhaps part of an agent s HTML client such as client of . In one embodiment it may be part of a system administrator s tool kit.

Window contains interactive options directed at various categories and functions. For example a new client section contains interactive options related to adding a new client to the active customer base of the enterprise. A customer service section contains interactive options presented to existing clients needing service. A new order section contains interactive options presented to existing clients wishing to do new business.

Each offered interactive option is an embedded executable function having the appropriate links to other system areas of CINOS such as may be relevant to the immediate interaction such as to services offered routing routines database searching interaction recording and so on.

An innovative function of window is to provide front end control of access to the enterprise by existing and potential clients customers. For example as a client contact or potential client interacts with the various media and functional options presented by the enterprise in window he or she is being directed according to enterprise rules in such a way that he or she may first be qualified or not to patronize the enterprise. Secondly the contacting person may be categorized and sorted as to type of qualified customer. Thirdly the person contacting person may be directed to pre selected media options by the enterprise for various services offered including but not limited to routing live interactions and so on.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention access window is fully customizable based on customer data and enterprise rules with the focus of such customization directed toward benefiting the enterprise and ultimately the client. That is the client s options within window are pre selected and preferred by the hosting enterprise based in part on data about the client details about the client s communication equipment and software and enterprise rules and constraints. In some embodiments the client may aid in customizing window . However as it is desired by the enterprise to provide service in a cost effective manner the client will be presented with options as preferred by the enterprise in most cases.

To further illustrate refer now to new client section . If window is part of the enterprise WEB page as is the case with this example there will be a variety of visitors which may or may not be pre qualified by the enterprise. Therefore an interested party would begin and be restricted to taking a new client survey illustrated as one of the options in section . If the enterprise rules require this as a first step then the other options may be enabled only upon completion of the survey. By choosing new client survey a second window may contain various survey options such as via e mail interactive voice recording type and send method or the like.

Information taken in the client survey is recorded and entered into a CINOS database such as DB of . Such information may also be compared against enterprise rules or constraints and other known information as may be available to the enterprise. Assuming the client is now recognized by the enterprise the client s media hardware and telephony information may be recorded for future interaction purposes. Such information may include the client s personal computer parameters including modem type Internet connection type computer platform type type of Internet phone application installed etc. Similarly COST telephone parameters may be recorded such as personal phone number business phone number cellular phone number forwarding numbers and so on. Such data will influence latter customization of his personal Window for the particular client including the types of media that will be offered.

Finally the client may be asked to create a password for the purpose of accessing CINOS. A section is provided containing a network log in option along with download sections for obtaining permanent and or temporary software as may be desired or needed or in some cases required for the client to access certain services view certain content and so on.

Section presents media options for clients seeking customer service from the enterprise. These options are in a preferred embodiment presented in a customized or personalized fashion within the client s window as was described above. Therefore each client patronizing the enterprise may access a version of window that differs in look and functionality than that of another client. In this example service section contains options for e mail chat program fax program a self help wizard and a voice wizard. Other media types may be added or subtracted from the client s window depending on any of several criteria. Personalization of widow takes into account client information as stored in CINOS database service agent media availability and preferences and perhaps any overriding enterprise rules. Unless and until a client is identified there are typically no options presented to the client for continuing a transaction with the enterprise.

For an identified client by selecting the e mail option the client s preferred e mail program may be activated for the purpose of sending a message to or soliciting a reply from a service agent. By selecting chat program the client may be launched into a scheduled service seminar featuring many clients interacting with a service expert regarding a certain subject. One enterprise rule regarding section may be that there is no telephone or I phone media option for customer service for a client in the absence of an ongoing project with the particular customer. In this sense an ongoing project includes any unfinished business that the client is involved in with the enterprise.

Self help wizards and voice wizards as illustrated in section may be offered to help a client resolve an issue without taxing further resource. Such wizards may be customized based on a client s recorded data perhaps confirming past interactions providing account or order status and so on. In some embodiments selecting an option might avail several additional options. For example selecting chat program may avail three possible chat programs to choose from with different schedules content and functionality attributed to each individual program.

New order section in this example contains various options adapted to facilitate placing orders. The options as illustrated herein include but are not limited to I phone call back promotional models video presentations an on line viewer and an order wizard. Interaction is the same as was stated with regards to section . For example selecting promotional models accesses a database containing the current promotional information and features of products which may be viewed interactively by the client using an on line viewer offered as one of the functional options tool . The options presented in the New Orders section may also be customized according to client identity demographics transaction history and enterprise rules.

On line viewers may enable the client to view documents that are not supported on his computer platform. Selecting video presentation may avail several types of videos for viewing such that the client may choose one. If the client does not have a viewer installed on his computer which will support the offered video perhaps the on line viewer may play the video or the client could download a temporary viewer from section etc. Selecting call back may bring up a second array of media choices made available by the enterprise for receiving a reply interaction from an agent.

By providing a controlled interface window such as window the enterprise may control routing and interaction right from the beginning of customer contact. Through the innovative method of linking and reporting to other CINOS functions and repositories much real time personalization of window according to enterprise rules and customer parameters may be made automatically. For example if a client s history indicates a propensity toward frequent buying an I phone option may be presented in customer service section in his window immediately after such a determination so that he may get direct customer service at all times.

Certain media options as described above may be afforded a certain priority over one another regarding interaction with the enterprise. For example a VIP client may have live interactive media choices offered in window such as I phone call back to COST phone video phone etc. A client known for infrequent contact or troublesome interactive history may be limited to text based interaction such as e mail and so on.

As an integral part of CINOS functionality window acts as a portal through which existing and potential clients may be screened categorized and routed according to enterprise rules. Customer interfaces such as window may be provided at various locations on a WAN such as the Internet without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Such portals may exist in different geographic regions and may be created for differing customer bases such as one for Latin America and one for the pacific rim and so on. Instances of CINOS routine may be distributed widely over a network.

Although the example provided herein is of a WEB form it will be apparent to one with skill in the art that a CTI counterpart may be created for the COST telephony network. Such a case may be a CINOS enhanced IVR at an SCP or customer access point in the COST network.

CINOS as previously described optimizes customer agent interaction in a manner which is economical and cost efficient to both the enterprise and the patronizing client. The customer interfacing window as taught herein with regards to is innovative in that it is a fully customizable portal that facilities seamless integration between clients and enterprise agents according to enterprise rules. Further innovation is evident in that client data is fully and seamlessly integrated with CINOS intelligence and enterprise rules regarding routing of interactions and other constraints or limitations that are programmed into the system. In effect logic from the front end or customer side to the back end or agent side is linked and accessible to all appropriate CINOS routines which include applicable CTI CINOS routines. The various customer interfacing logic is are explained more fully below in a series of process logic steps in a flow chart.

If the visitor wishes to be a client he may log in to the network system in step . Log in may be automatic in the event that CINOS remembers the client s assigned password or perhaps typing the password or other code may still be required for security reasons. At the time of log in window is presented in personalized fashion according to client data and enterprise rules in step . In step interaction between an enterprise entity and the client begins with a media type that is offered by the enterprise and selected by the client. An enterprise entity as immediately described above is herein defined as an agent knowledge worker service person or any other live attendant as well as any entity constituting an automated response action such as an automated fax an IVR automated file downloads etc.

At step if it is determined that the visitor is new then a new client survey is conducted in step . Step will determine if the new visitor is a client or business contact via the survey process. As described with reference to the client survey may be conducted using a variety of known techniques and media. Presuming that a new visitor qualifies as a client or business contact in step he or she may be asked to create a password in order to provide access to CINOS. In step the client s appropriate communication and system parameters are recorded for future reference and for use in customizing window .

At step a client instance of CINOS or perhaps another enabling application may be presented for download by the client. In some embodiments there may be no required software for download. Therefore step may be considered optional in this regard. In step the new client may log in to the network system and begin interaction. Because the client in this case is accessing the system for the first time the steps wherein he would obtain a customized window and begin interaction with an enterprise entity are not shown as intermediate configuration of media choices product preferences and the like may still be required before a customized interface may be presented. In one embodiment the client may not see a customized window until the next time he or she attempts to access the network.

Steps and for an existing business contact as determined in step are similar to steps and for an existing client although the rules for interaction such as media used personnel involved and so forth will be different. For example in step an existing business contact may be offered the option of using a network collaboration program wherein I phone file sharing video conferencing and the like are inherent to that one application.

It will be appreciated that there are many possible logic sequences or steps that may be followed in interfacing and enabling interaction between a client and an enterprise entity without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. presents just one possible example of many.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the rules governing the types of media offered to clients may be based on a combination of variables such as may be decided upon by the enterprise without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Likewise offered media types may be added or withheld from a client over a period of time based on such variables. Moreover such additions or subtractions of media availability with regards to customer interface window may be automated and based on calculated variables.

In one embodiment a client may add or subtract media choices if desired however the enterprise may reserve the right not to engage such media if added by a client.

In one embodiment special application independent media viewers such as the viewer offered in section of window of are offered to clients and possessed by agents so that initial illegible information may be made human readable regardless of the authoring application used by the agent or the client in the process of interaction.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention all CINOS controlled interactions with customers or business contacts are recorded and stored in a contact history comprising a MIS database and a text database such as were described with reference to copending application P3313PA and described above. That is actual multimedia interactions are recorded to one database or to a section of one database supporting all multimedia types used in the communication center and text based versions are stored in another database or portion of the same database. All of the actual recorded transactions and text versions are related as a threaded contact history which may be separate from or part of the same database as will be further explained below.

At the heart of the storage system is a mass storage repository adapted to store multimedia interactions as well as text based related files. Repository may utilize any form of digital storage technology known in the art such as Raid Array Optical Storage and so on. The storage capacity of repository will depend directly on it s implementation with regard to the size of the communication center and predicted amount of data that will be stored and kept by the system.

In this example repository is divided logically into two sections. One section multimedia information system MIS is responsible for housing all multimedia interactions defined as media that is not text based such as audio video and graphics based media. All multimedia interactions are stored in MIS whether incoming outgoing or internal. A second section herein referred to as text section is responsible for all text based interactions as well as text versions related to non text files. Sections and of repository are analogous to MIS and DB of .

Repository is connected to a communication center local area network LAN . Repository is accessible via LAN to authorized personnel within a communication center such as agents knowledge workers or the like and may in some instances also be made available to clients communicating with the call center. A network router RTN is shown connected to LAN via network connection . In this example network router is the first point within a communication center wherein DNT media arrives. Network router is exemplary of many types of routers that may be used to route data over LAN . An Internet protocol network telephony IPNT switch is connected to network router via data link as is known in the art. IPNT switch further routes or distributes live IPNT calls that do not require routing to a live agent. IPNT calls that are routed to live agents are sent over connection to LAN where they reach agent PC VDU s not shown or DNT capable phones not shown as illustrated via directional arrows.

An object of the present invention is to record all multimedia interactions and store them in MIS . A further object of the present invention is to similarly record text versions of and text files related to all multimedia interactions and to store them in text based section . For the purpose of the present invention a text version of a non text file is defined as a sufficient text rendition or description of a corresponding multimedia interaction. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an innovative mechanism wherein authorized persons may access any particular block of text and if desired call up the actual media to which the text relates.

Creating text based versions of live multimedia interactions may in some cases be accomplished via an automated method. For example a digital voice attendant is provided and linked to IPNT switch . Digital voice attendant may be of the form of a DNT capable IVR or other digital voice response mechanism as may be known in the art. Such automated attendants may interact with a voice caller instead of requiring a live agent. A speech to text converter is provided and linked to voice attendant . As digital voice attendant interacts with a caller speech to text converter uses voice recognition technology to convert the audio speech to text. Such text may then be stored automatically into text section and related to the also recorded audio data.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that as speech recognition technologies are further improved over their current state which is adequate for many implementations reliable text versions of audio transactions are not only possible but practical. Such speech to text conversions are used here only for the convenience of automation wherein no live attendant is needed to transcribe such audio data. The inventor is familiar with such converters as used in the CMOS system according to a preferred embodiment. Such converters provide convenience in the practice of the present invention but are not specifically required to achieve the objects of the present invention.

Manual transcription may also be used to convert audio video to text or code that may then be entered into text section . For example a live attendant is shown connected to LAN . Attendant in this case may be given the responsibility of transcribing audio files from speech to text and annotating video or graphics files for the purpose of creating text files related to the non text data. One or more live attendants such as attendant may be provided for this purpose. Some media arriving at a communication center such as the one represented via architecture will already be text based and therefore require no conversion or annotation. Short e mails Faxes word documents and so on are part of this media category.

An automated services system is illustrated as having a direct connection to section of the data repository. System is provided for certain text based interactions as described above wherein a complete text record of the interaction may be mirrored or otherwise created and stored into text section . Such automated services may include but are not limited to automated e mail and fax systems. For example a fax may be sent and mirrored into section or perhaps recreated using an optical character recognition OCR technique and then entered. Physical text documents such as legal papers and the like may be automatically scanned into text section before they are sent to clients. There are many possible automated techniques for entering text files into a database. Such methods described with regards to automated services are a convenience in practicing the present invention but are not specifically required to achieve the objects of the present invention.

With respect to the dual capability COST DNT of architecture a central telephony switch is provided to be a first destination for COST calls arriving from for example a PSTN network. Switch may be a PBX ACD or another known type of telephony switch. Internal COST wiring connects telephony switch to agent s individual telephones not shown . Switch is enhanced via a processor running an instance of T server and an instance of Stat server which are software enhancements known to the inventor and have been previously described. Such enhancements provide CTI applications such as intelligent routing but are not specifically required to practice the present invention. CINOS as previously described is adapted to be integrated with such software when present in a CINOS enhanced communication center.

An intelligent peripheral in the form of a COST IVR is provided for the purpose of interacting with callers seeking information and the like who do not require connection to a live agent. IVR technology may comprise voice response touch tone interaction or a combination of these technologies. IVR is linked to processor and also to automated services . An example of an IVR interaction may be the presentation to a caller of options for using an automated service such as those described above or perhaps waiting for a live agent.

A CTI to DNT interface is provided for the purpose of converting COST interactions to digital mode compatible with DNT so as to be adapted for digital storage and interaction according to CINOS functionality and enterprise business rules as described above. Interface is not specifically required to practice the present invention so long as appropriate application programming interfaces API s are provided for equipment that interfaces with CINOS. Bi directional arrows illustrated between interface and IVR represent the ability to route interactions in either direction. COST to DNT conversion may be accomplished in IVR in addition to or in place of interface . The connection architecture presented herein is exemplary only.

A speech to text converter is provided for converting audio from the CTI side to text for entering into text section as was taught with regards to converter on the DNT side. Actual recorded media interactions are illustrated entering MIS after text versions are rendered and entered into section however this is not required. In some instances text versions of multimedia interactions may be rendered after the interaction is stored. There is no limitation regarding sequence. It is sufficient to say that converters and are capable of real time conversion and entry.

Server shown connected to LAN is adapted to host a CINOS MGR operating system application which provides control and organization with regard to various functions provided by the CINOS system as a whole. The storage architecture represented herein by element and all it encompasses in this embodiment is meant only to be an example architecture as may be dedicated to the storage and organization of communication center data according to enterprise rules.

A unique method termed multimedia threading by the inventor is used in a preferred embodiment of the present invention for relating each multimedia interaction whether incoming to out going from or internal to the system such as between an agent and a supervisor. This innovative process allows agents or other authorized personnel to access text data and ability cross reference the data to actual recorded multimedia interactions which may be displayed and played back.

Threaded dialog as is known in prior art involves a system of strings or threads that are identified as being inherent to a single entity or subject matter wherein the dialog questions and replies is about that subject or about a question or subject that an entity has brought forth. A threaded dialog may be finite dialog is closed at some point or it may be ongoing. Typically a thread which connects or associates the pieces of dialog contains all of the dialog in the order that it happened such as in chronological order. Threading may be implemented based on other criteria as may be appropriate for a particular situation or by particular rules.

As previously described with reference to the background section prior art threading techniques are confined to text such as with an on line message board or the like. The inventor knows of no system that supports full multimedia interaction. The innovative implementation taught below integrates the text based thread with stored multimedia interactions such that one may interact with the thread and access various stored media associated with the thread.

Referring again to a customer is illustrated as having two threads. They are issue I and issue II. Customer has an assigned number XX XX that identifies him or her with respect to the CINOS system. Issues I and II may comprise sales dialog purchasing dialog or any other type or purposed dialog as may be generic to the hosting enterprise. Customer may well be a business contact or even an internal agent practicing dialog with a supervisor or the like.

A series of icons a d represent the type of media stored for each text block text not shown . For example issue I comprises first an e mail text followed by a fax text WEB text and V phone text. In this case a time stamp or other known method may be used to insure that each text block is in order. Icons a d are interactive pointers or links to the actual media interactions that they represent. That is the first block of e mail text is associated with an interactive icon in this case icon a. By clicking on icon a with a pointer device the actual e mail may be accessed and viewed. In an alternative aspect not only the actual transaction may be presented to a user for review but related files may also be listed or otherwise presented for selection and review.

A logical link represents cross referencing capability between sections and . Dialog may be threaded according to a wide variety of business rules. For example a thread or string may represent dialog about a customer product agent group of agents group of customers and so on. An identifier is assigned to an entity and to all the communication events to or from that entity or those in which the entity may have been involved such as a group discussion or chat. In this way all interactions may be organized and stored accordingly.

In one embodiment keyboard commands could be used to cross reference to actual media instead of icons. In another embodiment text versions of actual media are fully viewable with the text itself appearing in interactive form whereupon a double click may call up the associated media and so on. There are many variations within the scope of the invention.

Although actual recorded media interactions are in this embodiment stored in MIS there does not have to be two separate databases one for text and one for actual media . All data may reside in one database and be sectioned in storage. For example one click on the customer name may bring up text only while a double click on the text brings up the associated media.

In MIS recorded multimedia interactions are represented by icons I IV and VI. For example element I represents all recorded Video phone interactions. Element II represents all e mails. Element III represents all recorded COST interactions. Similar associations are made with respect to elements N and VI which represent WEB interactions and Video mails respectively. WEB interactions IV may include on line orders requests information forms signed certificates and so on.

Element V represents additional stored multimedia files dedicated to for example promoting the enterprises products or services. Promotional files V may contain files of the form of any enterprise supported multimedia. These files may be tools that can be sent to clients upon request or perhaps periodically.

Referring again to section element b located on the thread labeled issue I represents text from a fax. Because a fax is text based and not a multimedia interaction there is no corresponding media event associated with it. However the fax is threaded into the dialog according to in this case chronological order. A short example of a proposed dialog concerning issue I follows.

Element a represents an e mail sent by customer to the enterprise requesting pricing information. An enterprise agent responds with a fax b to customer containing the requested information. Customer then places an on line order element c along with a request for confirmation via video phone element d . Issue I may be closed at this point. Issue II may represent a threaded dialog concerning company service with regards to the customer order of issue I or perhaps an agent to manufacturer dialog regarding how the order was handled with respect to issue I.

In accordance with CINOS functionality as previously taught in descriptions above data may be mined from repository for the purpose of enhancing service to customer . Mined data may be used to affect routing of interactions product promotions or advertisements that may be sent to customer . In some cases mined data may effect new dialog with a customer or business contact resulting in new thread additions. A complete contact history with interactive linking to actual recorded media enables the enterprise to resolve disputes more easily better service the customer and enhance profitability for the enterprise.

If the interaction is of the form of non text media as identified in step then the MIS section of repository or section is notified to accept the input. At step the non text interaction is recorded into section of repository . This may occur in real time as the interaction takes place or some point after the media interaction was recorded.

In step a text version of the recorded media or a text based document related to the transaction is rendered for storage into section as part of the thread. In some instances as described with reference to step is automated via speech to text converters and occurs at the same time or before the recorded multimedia interaction is entered into section . In other instances text versions of multimedia interactions may be rendered after the recorded interaction is stored. A live attendant such as attendant of may be assigned to parse video and or audio for applicable text. Such parsed text is entered into section and takes it s place along the thread as was described above.

In all cases an identifying medium is used to assign portions of an ongoing dialog to the proper location along a thread as well as provide identification to actual recorded media for cross referencing such as may occur during a system audit or contact review. Further the appropriate icons and or links are created and associated to entered text wherein actual multimedia may be cross referenced in interactive fashion. Hence the type of media may be readily identified by an auditing or reviewing agent simply by browsing the threaded text with accessibility to the recorded events made by interactive method such as clicking an icon with a pointer device as was previously described. As an additional benefit all of the threaded dialog whether text based or not is rendered in a form that data mining may be used to create many useful relationships and to derive much useful information from the stored data.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that the order and specific function of logical steps as taught herein may vary according to the type of enterprise existing enterprise rules and so on. For example instead of threaded dialogs being inherent to a specific customer with the dialog being about the customers interactions it may be specific to a particular agent with the dialog about the agents activities. Such differences in thread assignment may be incorporated into one rules based repository.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention CINOS users comprising such as customers agents and business associates are provided with innovative multimedia applications that are containers for dedicated multimedia viewers enabling a particular user to perform a dedicated function or functions including gaining access to and viewing media from selected areas of CINOS data storage. Provision of such applications allows any objective to be gained regarding virtually any aspect of the enterprise. These interactive applications are built from a parent application or container that may contain all of the interactive modules that may be desired to effect a specific application to be presented to a user having a need for such an application.

According to various embodiments of the present invention which are described below the multimedia applications may be adapted for such tasks as placing orders previewing products determining customer profitability calculating sales volumes reviewing agent performances or any other enterprise conceived objective. The abilities and constraints applied to these unique applications are limited only by the imagination and tools available to an authorized programmer or worker such as a knowledge worker who creates the applications.

Among these functional modules are interactive media viewers IMV s which are provided and adapted for viewing certain media supported by the enterprise hosting a communication center employing CINOS. Supported media types may include but are not limited to telephony traditional or IP interactive voice response IVR e mails WEB embedded interfaces or forms faxes chat programs multiparty threaded discussions etc. IMV s are unique in the fact that they are dedicated viewers including an interactive layer that enables viewing of only pre selected media as defined by enterprise rules. For example CINOS users may be assigned an identification code or number which will also be tagged to all of their stored interactions as described elsewhere above with reference to FIG. . These codes may be used to associate individuals with limitations and constraints from viewing media that is not part of their own contact history for example . Other limitations or constraints may also be applied to IMV s as may be conceived and implemented by a programmer such as playing or viewing interactions of certain dates playing or viewing interactions about certain subjects and so on. An editable software layer inherent to each viewer enables a programmer to build such constraints into a particular viewer and to add the edited viewer to an IMA

Application Program Interfaces API s are provided to allow a user to send obtained data or calculated results to connected peripheral devices or software modules or applications as may be required for operations such as printing faxing sending over a network etc. If it is desired by enterprise rules for example that a customer be able to print certain text or graphic information obtained through IMA then the appropriate interface may be provided.

Database Access Modules DAM s are provided for allowing access to normally restricted databases that may be connected to CINOS architecture. Such databases will of course include multimedia information systems MIS customer information systems CIS which may also include contact and agent associated data external databases such as may be hosted by the enterprise and so on. Constraints may be applied to DAM s pertaining to which and or what portions of certain databases may be accessed by an application.

Programming language modules are provided and adapted to facilitate the type of platform system that an IMA such as IMA will be created for. One IMA such as IMA may be adapted to run on a variety of system types and platforms. System platform modules are provided as API s for intended supported system platform combinations. Mathematical function modules MFM s are provided and adapted to interact with CINOS databases for the purpose of performing pre selected calculations such as cost averaging and so on.

In this particular embodiment IMA is a finished application ready to be distributed. IMA contains default display modules not shown for the purpose of enabling computer screen display on a user s system as is known in the art. IMA may be stored in a special applications server not shown connected to the CINOS network either at WAN level or at the level of the hosting communication center. The method of distribution for IMA s such as IMA may be of the form of a WEB based client presentation to a user such as in customer window of for example. IMA may also be of the form of a browser plug in accessible via a server such as may be the case with a special applications server as described above. In other instances such applications may be made a part of an agent s desktop and so on. There are many and varied possibilities.

In this particular embodiment which is exemplary only IMA is of the form of an interactive purchase guide for bulk paper products as illustrated via underlined title. IMA in this example is logically separated into two distinct operations or functions. These are operation and operation . Operation is a product preview interactive guide while operation is an order guide. The number of operations built in to an IMA such as IMA will depend upon the intended purpose of the application according to enterprise rules.

For exemplary purposes assume that IMA which is in this case a purchase guide for bulk paper products is to be presented to a corporate buyer who is new on the job. Because he is new he may be uncomfortable with his own knowledge of how much or what kind of paper to buy. His predecessor may have a long purchase history with the enterprise. Therefore he requests an IMA such as IMA that will allow him to preview products browse the past purchase history of his predecessor and perform a calculation that averages by month the last years paper purchases made by his company.

According to enterprise rules IMA adheres most closely to the buyer s request. That is It allows for preview of products and leads the buyer toward an order . IMA may in some instances be designed specifically for one buyer if it is determined that his level of business contribution warrants it. However in most cases IMA applications such as application will be more generic with interchange between different users accomplished with some editing performed based upon the intended use of the application and user parameters.

A communication center may provide a number of standard IMA s with each IMA adapted to a different objective. A communication center may also provide custom built MIAs for any specific purpose. A certain amount of editing ability renders one IMA usable in more than one situation.

Referring now to IMA as previously described operations product preview and operation order guide are available and related to purchasing bulk paper products. Operation begins by presenting two different platform options from which a user may select. A platform A may be a Windows platform and a platform B may be a UNIX platform. There may be more or fewer options regarding platforms. Similarly applicable modules such as may be generic to a certain platform are installed with each platform. In this way one application may be run on differing platforms.

An API labeled as such shown logically connected beneath platforms A and B is illustrative of an interface for linked modules depended on platform choice. A database module DAM is first logically connected to the API module previously described. The DAM controls which database or databases may be accessed by IMA . A window shown immediately beneath the DAM provides an edit interface wherein the author or programmer may insert additional constraints such as allowing access to only certain database sections and so on.

A mathematical function module MFM labeled as such is shown beneath and logically connected to the edit window. MFM is adapted to allow prescribed mathematical operations to be performed relative to database information such as cost averaging grouping by product preference and so on. Various modules as have been described herein may bring up additional displays on a user s computer if the module in question offers a choice of operation or returns readable results. Furthermore standard preview modules not shown may be presented as object models and invoke standard viewers such as may be installed on the user s computer system.

An interactive media viewer block IMV shown logically connected to MFM allows the user to view pre selected media interactions that are persistently stored in a database such as MIS of . The IMV block shown may represent a plurality of unique IMVs or a single IMV. In this case three IMVs are involved and these are represented by the blocks labeled TXT text VID video and AU audio . Each individual IMV has an edit layer wherein a programmer may apply limitations or constraints relative to viewing capability. In some cases the same limitations may be applied to all the IMVs of an application in one editing sequence such as by doing one edit and copying that edit to other IMVs. Although there are three illustrated viewer modules that make up the IMV in this example more or fewer viewer modules may be used depending upon the intended use of IMA and enterprise rules.

Although not explicitly shown each IMV is editable through a software layer. In this way a user may be limited to viewing certain media interactions and transactions that are allowed via enterprise rules. For example TXT viewer may only be able to view e mails from the user and agent in a specific interaction thread but not intermittent e mails on the thread that may be from agent to agent or supervisor to agent and so on. Because each interactor with CINOS has an identification and all interactions from or to them are so identified these identifiers may be used in the edit layer of each viewer to constrain the user. In this way a user may be granted access to a history database and view only his interactions without imposing on other users who share the system. Likewise agents or supervisors charged with the task of reviewing the activities of certain other agents may use applications such as IMA adapted for the stated purpose and be constrained in terms of whose interactions agent s may be viewed and so on. In this manner full use may be provided to specialized users without exposing otherwise sensitive formation that is not pertinent to the user or the purpose of the IMA.

Operation created to allow a user to place an order for products is in this case a logical close for the previous operation. A module labeled Media Options may present standard media choices that the enterprise accepts for placing an order such as IP phone e mail and so on. A connected text module TXT allows the user to send a quick text order while on line. A send button sends a completed order to the enterprise.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that an IMA such as IMA may be programmed for virtually any enterprise objective without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention such as those already described. By utilizing pre built modules instead of writing codes line by line programmers may greatly increase the efficiency of application preparation and presentation to users. In many cases only slight editing is required to present a new application to a particular user. By using COM and other known conventions such as Java applications are quickly assembled or modified as has been taught herein.

In step the programmer or application author opens his tool kit. Such a tool kit may be part of tool kit of on a CINOS desktop interface. In step the author sets system and platform parameters. That is he inserts the proper functional modules for use of the application on specific platforms and or system types. For example the author may set up one application to run on more than one platform or system such as IBM and Macintosh. It should be noted here that if more than one type of system is supported in one application then the associated modules will need to be included as well.

In step the author selects a programming language module containing libraries of known programming languages and codes. As known in the art there are different programming languages used for different platforms. The author in addition to building with pre assembled modules or building blocks may have to write certain functional code in the supported language. In a preferred embodiment the author has access to these language libraries from within his tool kit.

In step database access module s DAMs are selected and inserted. As previously described with reference to these modules will determine which and what portions of databases may be accessed. In an alternative embodiment these restrictions may also be a part of the editable layer of IMVs. Step covers mathematical functions relative to selected databases. Mathematical function modules MFM s allow a user to perform pre defined operations. MFMs may or may not be needed in an IMA. This step may be omitted if no such functions are requested by a user or otherwise required in an application.

In step interactive media viewers IMV s are created using viewer modules adapted to view certain media of the type that stored interactions comprise. An IMV is a module that may comprise one or more than one media viewer. Each of these viewer modules are editable via software layer and may function alone or as a component of a larger module comprising more than one viewer .

In step closing modules are inserted to complete the application. For example order modules are one example of a closing modules. Modules adapted to return displayed results would be another example. Moreover peripheral device API s may be inserted to allow results to be printed faxed sent over the network etc. In this way a supervisor reviewing the performance of a group of agents may report to other concerned parties such as managers enterprise board members or the like.

The example as illustrated herein is basic but is deemed adequate by the inventor for illustration of one typical IMA building sequence. The description and order of steps may vary considerably.

IMA s such as IMA are transportable over a network and may be stored on a special applications server at network level or within the communication center. In some embodiments user s will be connected to the Internet when using IMA s allowing CINOS access. In other embodiments agents may access CINOS resources while working off line with respect to the Internet. In such cases logging on to CINOS is still required.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that IMA as taught herein is interactive and displayable on a PC VDU that is logged into CINOS through a WAN. However this is not specifically required to practice the present invention but rather preferred. Other embodiments may include presenting a CTI interface such as an IVR wherein a user may interact with the application via voice or touch tone response.

In still another embodiment such applications may be presented via external media such as on a floppy disk s or CD ROM wherein a user may by inserting the disk or CD obtain the ability of accessing the enterprise via WAN gaining access to CINOS and performing an objective with the IMA.

An object of the present invention is to allow certain CINOS systems to utilize data such as data about customers contacts business associates products and agents to accomplish objectives and to effect improvements in overall system performance. Such data must be utilized very quickly in order to aid in influencing such system objectives as efficient routing to clients based on client data or as another example generating an updated sales volume report based on an entire customer base s latest transactional history. Certain CINOS automated systems will have to be able to make decisions in a time frame that would not be sufficient to allow physical accessing of actual media. Therefore an innovative interface between stored multimedia data and various CINOS intelligent systems is provided and taught below.

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention a stored media interface engine is provided in the form of an interaction object model IOM . This unique convention provides a system accessible abstract of all stored interactions within a multimedia communication center.

Repository is analogous to mass repository of . It is logically divided into two sections. One section is for threaded text labeled Text Based Data and one is for multimedia storage labeled MIS Database. All of the communication center s interactions and transactions in this example are persistently stored in repository .

Automated CINOS systems such as systems through are adapted to interact with data stored in repository in order to perform their intended functions related to CINOS operation. For example CIS uses data in repository for presenting information to agent s at the time of or ahead of a live interaction. AT SYS has to access and process data for generating system audits. RT SYS requires data for intelligent routing purposes. AS SYS uses data to update and configure services such as faxes e mails voice messaging and the like.

IOM is adapted to function as an interface between repository hard data and the data interaction systems as described above. IOM is an object model comprising objects as representations of stored files in repository such as non text files of recorded transactions. Each object making up the model is a representation of one such file. In a preferred embodiment IOM is a COM based model with which other CINOS COM based applications may readily interact without language conversion interfaces. However m other embodiments API s may be provided where language differences are present.

IOM has various capabilities in various embodiments which may include among other functions a search function adapted to accept parameters as a guide to obtain requested information from IOM memory element . There is in this embodiment a data mining function adapted for mining hard data and converting mined data into suitable code for applying to memory objects represented interactions . A display function is adapted to enable data results to be displayed on suitable screen monitors which may be associated with various data interaction systems as previously described. An API function provides appropriate interface for linking interaction data systems such as systems to IOM . An edit function provides editing ability to object parameters by system applications which may in some instances be automated or in other instances manned by administrators or knowledge workers. An object memory is a single file containing all of the objects which represent all of the communication center s stored interactions.

IOM is run in much the same way as a standard relational object model as is known in the art except that it is confined to text data and capable of multi tasking performing multiple simultaneous and unrelated functions with respect to multiple system access. Another marked difference from a standard object model is the data mining functionality . In a preferred embodiment function may be used to add additional data to IOM memory in real time.

IOM uses metadata meaning data about data in it s abstract representation of hard data files stored in repository similar to other data warehousing systems. Such metadata may be in some embodiments compressed in memory for economy in storage. In a case such as that described above a compression and decompression function would be added to IOM . IOM utilizes memory area for storing metadata objects a z as illustrated. Metadata objects a z as illustrated each represent a single transaction or interaction file stored in repository . Hence the number of actual objects stored in memory will equal the number of interactions stored in repository if every stored transaction is shadowed in the IOM.

IOM is innovative in the fact that it is an object model interface used as an accessible abstract representation of hard data files. Therefore data interaction systems may typically utilize IOM in performing their dedicated functions without accessing any hard data stored in repository . The inventor knows of no system wherein data systems may obtain stored information to aid their dedicated functions in the manner and with the apparatus described above.

Memory is typically located in repository as is the rest of IOM functionality as illustrated via directional arrows emanating from repository and pointing to a separate IOM . Software adapted to communicate with IOM not shown may reside in each of the data interaction systems as illustrated via directional arrows pointing to API function . The above described relationship is not specifically required to effect the goal of the present invention but rather preferred in it s practice. IOM may reside on a separate database that is linked to repository . Similarly API function may contain all of the necessary components for interface with all communication center data interaction systems without requiring each system to host software. There are many differing architectural possibilities.

According to an embodiment of the present invention IOM is continually updated in real time as interactions may be stored or deleted in repository . Rules based routines determine what type of data will be used in each meta data object stored in memory . Typically enterprise important information such as client ID client parameters transactional analysis such as profitability rating credit rating and so forth will accompany more interaction specific data such as media type interaction date participating party ID s and their parameters and any parsed information specific to the interaction and known to be required by one or more of the automated services. Interaction specific information may include interaction purpose or goal interaction results such as purchase information resolved issue information and so on.

Memory objects such as objects a z representing interactions are not only identified with regards to involved parties as previously described but may also be identified and associated according to the common thread order of interaction as represented in repository or more specifically the text based portion which is threaded dialog.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that an IOM such as IOM may be utilized with databases other than repository without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example IOM may also be used as a system interface to product information databases external knowledge databases or virtually any other database such as may be connected to CINOS or a similar operating system.

In step a request to access an IOM such as IOM of is received from a data interaction system such as RT SYS of . In step the IOM is activated to receive commands related to a dedicated operation or pre defined process. Activation in this sense is defined as activation to receive from or communicate with a specific requesting system.

In step commands are sent to the IOM for the purpose of initiating IOM functions as may be desired. In step the IOM performs the requested function or functions. In this case the function or functions are adapted to provide information to be used in routing of a new interaction. A simple example of a routing related function would be to return the information associated with the identified client s last 5 interactions in order to determine a best fit agent to accept the new interaction. If it is determined that the last 5 interactions are leading to a purchase and the prominent agent involved in the last 5 interactions is identified then the new interaction may be held for that agent in the hopes that statistically he is more likely to obtain a new order from the client. However if the last 5 interactions are stagnant or leading away from a purchase than the interaction may be routed to a new agent perhaps with more skill at motivating clients to buy and so on.

In step displayable results from performed functions are returned to requesting systems. In some instances results will not be required to be human readable or to be displayable on a monitor. However in other instances this may be required such as an instance wherein data about a client is forwarded to the receiving agent ahead of the clients interaction.

It will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan that the process steps described above may vary in number and description according to type of business type of data interaction system requesting information enterprise rules and type of data accessed. This basic example is meant to provide a broad scope of functionality.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a multimedia communication center operating CINOS according to previous co related embodiments is provided as part of CINOS a means to initiate and manage various business processes related to communication workflow. Such business processes are defined as enterprise created applications procedures and so forth that are adapted to return a result or provide a solution regarding an issue or request made by a client or other entity.

As briefly described in the background section above in a multimedia communication center it is desired to automate business processes where possible and to be able to break down the processes into tasks and sub tasks that are strictly controlled and timed. Prior art network systems require considerable human intervention while proceeding with a business process while for example a client waits for a resolution. Similarly more time is consumed because actual media and hard data may be accessed and processed without the benefit of an abstract representation of data metadata as discussed above relative to an interaction object model IOM . Therefore an Interactive Process Model IPM is provided as a generic programmable module which when complete represents and conducts a defined business process. An IPM according to this invention has ability to obtain data from an IOM and to manage business applications in terms of timing and execution of main tasks and sub tasks that are programmed according to enterprise rules.

IPM is a programmable interactive engine as previously described. That is one may program IPM according to various tasks and sub tasks that may be required for the execution of a particular business process. After basic programming or set up IPM has the capability of accessing data from among other possible sources the IOM described above and using that data in the execution of it s intended goal. IPM is innovative in the fact that it begins as a generic object model for example a COM container in which a programmer may add specific functionality COM objects to create a functional interface engine or model that may execute a timed business procedure according to enterprise rules.

Although IPM is in this case a loan application process such an IPM may be programmed to execute virtually any conceivable business process that an enterprise may offer as a wholly or partially automated service to clients. IPM in this example is presented as a series of rows and columns comprising entry fields and return fields in a GANT chart. For example before the desired functionality is inserted into IPM it is a generic COM model that is adaptable via programming for various business processes and resource interface as previously described. It will be apparent to those with skill in the art that a COM model and a GANT form are each simply exemplary of known devices that may be employed in practicing the invention

The format of entry and return fields presented herein is not required to practice the present invention. The inventor merely deems this particular format to be friendly to a programmer building the model and analyzing the returns such as may be displayed on a computer screen. A tool kit aids a programmer with building and fine tuning an IPM such as IPM . Such a tool kit may be part of the programmers desk top CINOS application such as perhaps tool kit of or may reside in and be accessible from a server hosting a CINOS Manager application such as server of .

Referring again to a title row comprises column headers and a link to a pop up editing window that provides for entering steps and necessary parameters. The pop up window in a preferred embodiment has input fields for entering task numbers specific action for the task sequence and pre requisites related to other tasks allotted time to complete and notification parameters as well as a Cancel and a Save function. Through the input window a programmer can design and relate all tasks and sub steps needed for a process.

Because IPM is a container for COM objects task objects may also be loaded as required by the programmer in order to set up the main and sub tasks inherent to the process as previously described such as by drag and drop method as is known in the art. For example certain objects or modules to be inserted are for access to certain data from the IOM while other objects are adapted for accessing certain other databases or resources or for performing certain process related functions.

A variety of notification command modules may be inserted into IPM according to possible results or states that may appear during process execution. The actual module that will be invoked will depend in part on the programmer and in part on the process sequence. Some of the windows are return windows that return results during execution of the process. These are windows in the columns labeled time begin time end and actual time.

In this embodiment as a programmer enters new steps and sub steps in building a new application module the step numbers with name and generic parameters appear as new rows. When the last step is entered and configured the GANT chart is complete and the process is ready to invoke and execute.

A completed chart is editable in the sense that steps and sub steps may be altered added deleted and the like along with names allotted times action parameters and the like. A programmer may therefore select an existing application module and edit it to save as a new application module.

When a module is complete the application created may be stored and related to other tasks such that the application may be called whenever necessary to perform functions for the operating system. Such processing will typically be transparent to agents clients knowledge workers and the like but on certain occasions by need a chart may be displayed while a process is running or for other diagnostic purpose.

In general building modules objects contained in a programmers tool kit are generic to the basic processes being created by the enterprise including standard interface and command objects to other resources or CINOS systems. These building objects used to program IPM may be provided by the provider of the CINOS system according to the general type of business and system architecture used by the enterprise. In one embodiment an enterprise programmer may create the building objects according to desired enterprise functionality and custom CINOS architecture. Therefore one CINOS system software package may be provided specifically for a loan company while another CINOS system software package may be provided for an investment firm and so on.

Referring now back to as a programmer defines steps and sub steps as tasks to be performed he she is setting up the main tasks and sub tasks that the application will perform when executed. In this particular example task is a pre qualification task for a loan as evidenced by the name Pre Qual in window in the Name column.

Task comprises 3 sub tasks namely sub task sub task and sub task . Sub task comprises a module for obtaining data from a general credit field such as may be stored in a database and represented via metadata in the IOM described above. Hence sub task would comprise the necessary modules or objects for interface with the IOM previously described above and for obtaining general credit data which may be an enterprise rating system code derived from actual credit reports. Additional related data may also be accessible in step such as a list of creditors payment history and so on. Step provides access to data about credit to the enterprise and step provides access to data about income such as total monthly income source of income etc. In this way main task may be completed by executing the sub tasks 

In building an IPM such as IPM a goal is to provide an interfacing process application that may execute and perform an entire business process from start to end according to CINOS constraints time constraints and enterprise rules. Once completed tested and fine tuned an IPM such as IPM may be used as a functional model for the business process that it represents.

Column represents a time that each step and sub step begins executing within the CINOS system. Numerals illustrated in column represent units of time expired as the process is executed. For example Main task named Pre Qual begins at 0000 the time that the application is invoked . A client who is requesting a loan via telephone or other media may invoke IPM thus beginning it s automated execution while the client waits in queue. In some embodiments wherein a client is not live in queue an agent may initiate the process based on a not live request such as an e mail or fax. In general the time displayed in windows under TIME Begin are returns only based on the actual times related and previously required steps are completed. That is typically a task will not begin at a fixed time from 0000 but will begin as soon as pre requisite tasks are all completed.

Windows in column show the time that a step actually ends. This is typically a return window as well and the time displayed will be the begin time plus the task elapsed time to completion. The programmer typically allots a time for each task and the actual time may be more or less than the allotted time. Other actions may be invoked in the case that the actual time exceeds the allotted time.

All sub steps under a main task typically are allotted time increments according to completion goal of the allotted time for the main task such that the their sum equals the time allotted for the main task. The purpose for allotting time segments for each task and sub task is so that efficiency improvements may be pursued with regards to client waiting and system performance and that interfaces with other systems such as routing systems or the like are handled smoothly. The time allotments as described are in effect time goals set by the enterprise. Time modules not shown are COM tools inserted by the programmer.

Windows in column represents return fields that return actual elapsed times associated with each task and sub task. For example Main task Pre Qual began at time 0000. Allotted time for main task is 0010. Main task was actually completed at time 0008 or 0002 ahead of schedule. As is the case with column Time End times in which the associated sub tasks are completed are increments whose sum equals the actual time for the main task to obtain completion.

Windows under column contains notification fields under the name field Notify which is part of title row . If there are no problems in the execution of a task or sub task then notification is given to go on to the next task or sub task. However if there are problems in execution such as operation time out or insufficient data for return then a suitable notification command may be given to the system such as return to agent repeat prior task or sub task and so on.

It is important to note here that according to enterprise rules notification may include stopping the process and requesting human intervention allowing more allotted time for a task or sub task to complete and then repeating the task or sub task or any variety of other options.

In this example IPM comprises 4 main tasks of which main task has already been described. Main task is determination of loan type. IPM may comprise tasks or sub tasks that may be executed in parallel under certain circumstances. Such is the case with part of main task or more specifically sub task . For example choices and data regarding loan type amounts of loan purpose for loan and the like may be held in a separate section or database such as product database or the like. Therefore the multi taskable IPM may begin main task upon invocation at time 0000. However because a sub task requires the same data obtained with regards to main task it cannot begin until main task is complete or at 0008 as indicated in column .

A sub task is depended from sub task and is a data sorting operation. An example would be the sorting of assets from liabilities. Sub task allows insertion of data on a selected interactive or multimedia loan application in an automated fashion. Hence the first 2 Main tasks and their associated sub tasks pre qualifies a client and obtains and inserts required data into an interactive application. For the purpose of this example there have been no errors or problems with the first 2 main tasks allowing all notifications to proceed with the process without human intervention.

IPM includes a main task for post qualification and data validation. Such a task may be required according to enterprise rules with a system recommendation to be returned regarding weather or not a particular client should qualify. It should be noted here that a small amount of time elapses between a main task and a first sub task with regards to main tasks this is meant by the inventor to show system preparation time to execute to first sub tasks.

Under main task a sub task validates income. For example a client s income data instead of being current may be out of date according to a time constraint imposed by the enterprise for updating income data in a database. If this is the case then a suitable notification may be made to the system. The process may be temporarily halted due to the notification while an IVR interacts with the client to provide more current data. After the client has provided the data it is updated to the IOM and sub task may be repeated. In some embodiments subsequent tasks or sub tasks in a process may be executed while an IVR solicits more data from the client provided that they are not critically tied to the problem task or sub task that could not be completed.

A sub task validates the applicant s source of income perhaps by accessing a current database containing employment records provided by the client s employer. In one embodiment an automated out dialer may be used to contact the employer. When connection is made the call may be transfer to an IVR or a live attendant so that validation may be completed. In some cases this will take more than the allotted time shown in this example because human intervention is utilized. In such cases where it is known or perceived that human intervention will be required then more time will be allotted for the planned purpose. However if the required data is supplied ahead of the loan application and stored for access by IPM no human interface will be required.

Similarly a sub task may prompt the client via IVR or live attendant for inclusion of any added income such as may not be indicated in data storage such as spousal income an additional job income source and so on. Such IVR or live attendant interaction may be part of the loan procedure with appropriate time allotted to complete such procedures and not specifically the result of a problem or notification. Therefore the amount of human intervention included in a business process such as represented by IM may be dictated by enterprise rules.

A sub task calculates the debt to income ratio and other required calculations or manipulations of data and then makes a system recommendation based on the calculation and enterprise rules to the agent to which the client will be transferred for closing. Hence the notify field for sub task is labeled present. Upon receiving the present notification the system forwards the information completed loan application to an agent ahead of the client s call. An interface to the automated routing system enables IPM to determine which agent will receive the client out of queue.

A main task is simply to display on an agent s graphical user interface GUI a completed copy of the loan application associated with the client s identification and incoming call. The notification field returns END at task because it is the end of the procedure. At this time a copy of IPM with all of the fields complete may be sent to the programmer or system administrator as indicated on a top row comprising the label field loan application Time begin field 0000 Time End field 00305 Actual Time field 00255 and an update notification option labeled Update.

In this example the actual time of 00255 for completing a loan application and routing it to an agent is 0005 ahead of the allotted time or goal time. The programmer may elect to update IPM as the most efficient model yet created thereby using it again for subsequent applications or he may elect to fine tune IPM further based on the information provided in the returned model.

Each Interactive Process Module created is adapted to operate with a CISNOS operating system according to the present invention. As such each completed module is callable by the OS when needed to perform its programmed function. Further each module is provided with one or more inputs to be able to perform its function. In the example of qualifying a loan applicant as described above the required inputs will be such as a potential borrower s identity b type of loan desired c amount of loan requested and d payback period requested. Moreover each module is adapted to interact with other CMOS modules. For example the loan qualification application described is adapted to access other modules such as the IOM using the potential borrower s ID as a key to recall information such as income information. Generally speaking process modules will have then certain commonalties such as at least one defining input a task to be performed based on input and a result to be returned as well as a facility for returning the result. Such results may in some cases be Yes No a recommendation or the like and may be either displayed for a recipient or used as a further input to another Interactive Process Module.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that one IPM may be employed for one business process containing various secondary alterations to the generic process without departing from the spirit and scope of the preset invention. For example a mortgage loan may have differing tasks and sub tasks than an auto loan and so on. However because access to system repositories and resources are similar in most loan processes regardless of type or amount of loan modules may be inserted that cover the options. Moreover separate business processes may be run from one IPM as long as the required modules are present and operational.

It will further be apparent to one with skill in the art that the present invention may utilize a convention other than COM such as by Java applet or the like.

As previously described IPM is innovative in part because a generic application or model may be used for building several differing automated processes and because it breaks down a process into tightly controlled tasks and sub tasks that are executed in concert through interface with other CINOS systems. As a result complicated business processes may be executed within CINOS much faster and more efficiently than with prior art systems. Furthermore processes may in many instances be wholly automated and integrated with system routing and other intelligent services.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention a multimedia communication center is provided as part of CINOS including an interface engine or model that allows communication center interactions resulting from diverse interaction paths to be recorded and entered as threaded dialog in concert with threaded dialog from more conventional interactions such as are recorded and entered via multimedia threading as described above.

For the purpose of this specification a diverse interaction path means a non routine or less routine type of communication path that is typically more complicated than a conventional interaction path such as a multi agent conference or in place discussion regarding an enterprise client or issue generic to the client. Another example would be simultaneous communication between two or more agents with outside vendors to assist a client who is live and in queue. Yet another example would be a multi client discussion group organized around a commonly shared issue or product. It is desired that such dialog or dialogs including associated media is made a part of an accessible contact history wherein the diverse interactions may take their place among the more conventional interactions making up a customer or issue specific multimedia thread in a database or contact history.

CINOS manages traditional interactions according to a multimedia threading technique taught above wherein various methods including the use of a live attendant are used to record parse and enter interaction data into the contact history. Such dialog is threaded and associated with actual recorded media through use of icons or links whereby upon interacting with such links or icons one may have access to actual stored media. However as interaction paths become more diverse and complicated as in the examples provided above it becomes apparent that added functionality and innovation is needed to enable efficient organization and recording of such data into the contact history so that not only are primary dialogs and associated media simple to access but also secondary dialogs and media resulting from more diverse interactions.

Interaction dialogs among second and perhaps third parties involved in a transaction such as perhaps a contract negotiation may occur simultaneously and in many instances without inclusion of the primary parties to the transaction or negotiation. Therefore the prospect of logically including those dialogs among the primary dialogs on a client or issue identified thread is more complex. In one embodiment of the present invention such functionality is provided via a unique event handler adapted to identify and organize such dialogs so that they may be associated along the proper thread or threads in a contact history.

The example provided herein is meant to represent just one possible interaction set that may be tracked recorded and made a part of a contact history of a communication center utilizing CINOS. Diverse interactions as previously described in the background section and described with examples above may include virtually any conceivable interaction or group of simultaneous interactions that may comprise more than a simple one on one interaction whether incoming out going or internal communication using any supported media.

Also the exemplary DIM of is shown with a number of functional code sets for accomplishing certain ends such as assigning ID to transaction partners and the like. In these functions are shown as within the boundaries of the DIM. This is not meant to limit the DIM model to having complete code sets as a part of each DIM. In reality such code may be programmed as a part of a DIM in some instances and in other instances the DIM is provided with ability to call and use existing code in CINOS. CINOS as described elsewhere in this specification has for example functional code for tracking commitments and reminding parties to commitments of approaching and expired time deadlines. DIM modules may be adapted to call this and other such operating code to accomplish purposes of the particular DIM. The location of functional code examples in should therefore be taken only to represent the existence and use of the code not whether or not the code is resident in the DIM.

Referring again to for exemplary purposes assume that a customer who is a subscriber to CINOS is engaged in a purchasing process with a communication center agent as illustrated via indicated link . Perhaps customer is negotiating to purchase a turn key machine shop operation that is being put together as a package by the hosting enterprise. There are in this example two other agents involved in the process. These are agent and agent as illustrated. In order to provide a complete package to customer the enterprise must enlist the cooperation of 3 outside vendors who will each provide key components of the package. These are vendor vendor and vendor . For the purpose of this example it will be assumed that vendors are not subscribers to CINOS and are not connected to CINOS although in some embodiments they may well be subscribers connected to a CINOS driven system.

A data repository is provided as part of the CINOS architecture and is adapted to store multimedia and text based interactions as well as providing an accessible threaded history of communication center dialogs. Repository is analogous to repository of . As such it is logically divided into two sections one for storing threaded dialog and text based media Text based Data and one for storing recorded multimedia interactions MIS Database such as may have occurred with respect to enterprise activity.

As customer converses with agent the conversation is being recorded and entered into MIS database while a text version is being installed on a dialog thread assigned to the customer in the Text based data section of repository as described above. The recording and storing of this simple interaction is accomplished as described with respect to embodiments presented with reference to see and the text describing above. However interactions between other involved agents and vendors are important to the enterprise in terms of selling the machine shop and to the customer in terms of insuring that every angle is covered with respect to his planned purchase.

DIM allows these additional diverse interactions to be recorded and included on the dialog thread belonging to customer in repository . DIM is adapted in this embodiment to assign CINOS identification code to each outside vendor such as vendors as illustrated via a function module labeled as Temporary Vendor ID. This identification may be accomplished in a variety of ways such as perhaps attaching a unique code to a vendor s parameters which may include phone numbers e mail addresses IP addresses company titles etc. The identification may be temporary such as for a time period covering a series of planned interactions or permanent depending on enterprise rules. In this way CINOS may track and identify all communications to or from vendors . Because agents and customer are subscribed to CINOS they have permanent identification as do all their enterprise interactions.

Part of DIM allows for in place agent collaboration or discussion via function module titled Agent Collaboration. Function module may be an existing multimedia chat program that may be based in a variety of media such as audio video audio or text. Agents are illustrated herein as engaged in collective collaboration via module . An on screen computer discussion would be a likely venue for such collaboration.

Agents in this embodiment are illustrated as being engaged in conversations with vendors respectively as illustrated via links connecting the agents and the vendors. For example agent may be conversing with customer via COST phone while engaged with vendor via DNT phone such that the DNT conversation is not audible to customer . This may be accomplished via methods known in the art such as a progressive hold button or switching device. Agents and are similarly engaged with vendors and respectively. In this case agents are soliciting assurances that vendors will have no problems with availability and delivery of their respective parts of the turnkey package. Perhaps exact parameters are being worked out as well such as just in time delivery date assurances and so on.

As agents obtain required information from vendors they are collaborating and sharing the information via in place discussion through interactive function module . As the agents finish collaborating agent may relay such information as may be desired to customer via COST connection and perhaps acquire a purchase order for the machine shop. Hence a complicated series of interactions with multiple parties has transpired in a comparatively short period of time in order to aid customer in making a decisive purchase without ongoing and periodic communication being necessary over a much longer time. It should be noted here however that multiple Simultaneous interaction as illustrated in the example is not required to invoke the aid of DIM or to practice the present invention. The inventor intends only to show that invoking DIM to aid in organizing and threading dialog from the above described diverse interaction may be beneficial in this instance. The exact parameters and functionality of DIM will of course depend on enterprise rules.

Coordinating and threading dialog from the multi party interaction is performed in this embodiment via DIM as was previously described and will be further detailed below. Supplied interface modules within DIM provide command capability to other CINOS routines. One of these modules is an IOM interface that may obtain data from the IOM regarding customer vendors or other related data and relay such data to agents involved in the above described transaction such as agents . Similarly an IPM interface may obtain data such as may be processed in conjunction with any automated process that customer is engaged in and mirror such data to agents as may be required. An example would be perhaps mirroring data processed by an IPM handling the customer s overseas shipping information or the like.

Because each participant to the dialog is identified and all of the interactions are identified they may be time stamped and organized according to such identification or identifications by an interaction sorter module . Agent and customer may in some embodiments maintain priority on the thread in which the turnkey purchase dialog is a part. However because the threaded dialog supports multimedia and may accept additional information secondary dialog resulting from agents during collaboration and agents to respective vendors may be inserted onto the customer s thread according to any enterprise rule. Interaction sorter may organize the secondary interactions according to identification parameters add a time stamp and sort according to chronological order. If simultaneous interactions are taking place such as was the case in this example then they may be sorted by involved agent ID and threaded sequentially as dialog groups such as all interactions of agent followed by all interactions of agent followed by all interactions of agent followed by all agent collaboration dialog.

The dialogs may be logically inserted on the thread of customer via a dialog insert module which is a command interface to various data entry systems such as may be associated with speech to text converters automated fax systems e mail systems or the like. Module may also provide entry paths to live attendants for latter entry after transcription of video or the like.

Insert dialogue module may in some embodiments provide for secondary dialog to be entered on hidden threads marked by interactive icons or markers inserted and adapted to reveal the hidden dialog when selected such as with a pointer device. In this way primary agent customer dialog may be viewed separately from intermediate agent to agent collaborative dialog dialogue with third parties and so on. Interactive icons may also accompany such dialog for the purpose of calling up primary recorded dialogue. In this way a system auditor or other worker may review an involved transaction to insure that nothing was missed or overlooked by various parties to the transaction. Also an accurate record may later be printed out if required to settle a future dispute or unresolved issue related to the transaction.

As an open interface DIM may be adapted to handle multiple unrelated interactions as they may occur within a multimedia communication center. In another embodiment separate DIM s may handle separate diverse interactions. Similarly there are many possibilities regarding the location of a DIM within CINOS architecture. For example DIM may be part of a CINOS manager application such as described with reference to server of P3313PA . Moreover DIM may be adapted to handle only diverse interactions as defined by enterprise rules or may in fact handle all communication center interactions.

A schedule and reminder module is adapted to notify CINOS when an identified party to a transaction must fulfill a promise or scheduled task associated with a transaction or negotiation. A universal CINOS data and time function tracks all recorded interactions and ages them accordingly much like a computer operating system time and date function. If a specific interaction involving a scheduled promise approaches deadline then notification arrangements to the responsible party may be made ahead of time. A notification interface module alerts an automated message system which may be part of repository or held separately on the network to send notification of the commitment to involved parties.

The DIM described above is illustrated according to a particular diverse interaction situation involving a customer and multiple agents and vendors. A multitude of differing interaction paths may however be supported and enhanced. For example a DIM may be programmed in a manner that customers purchasing particular product may be automatically logged into a discussion group existing for the purpose of interactive technical support among customers. In this example the discussion group can be a WEB based chat room a video conferencing facility or may support any other medium supported by the CIOS system. In addition to allowing the customers to interact through the MMCC many enhancements may be provided specifically to such a group such as database access to technical information and the like pertinent to the particular product

As another example outside businesses such as vendors and the like identified in the CINOS system may interact with one another for defined purposes through a customized DIM in CINOS. In this case vendors and in may have an interdependency in supplying parts or services for a CINOS managed process or project. A DIM may be set up quickly and easily allowing the two vendors to cooperate and to access certain information in the enterprise data repositories related to the defined purpose of the DIM and the project.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that a DIM such as DIM may comprise additional or fewer modules or modules of a differing function than the ones illustrated herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example additional interface modules may be added and adapted to interface with other CINOS routines such as routing functions or other automated services. It will also be apparent to the skilled artisan that vendors supplying the enterprise with products destined for customers may or may not be utilizing CINOS systems without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example vendors in this example may receive automated and scheduled notification for just in time delivery or the like via notification interface if it is operationally interfaced with a CINOS out bound out dialer application.

It should also be apparent to one with skill in the art that CINOS interpretation of a diverse interaction as opposed to a conventional interaction may be programmed according to enterprise rules without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example a one on one interaction of any media type may be considered by an enterprise to be a conventional interaction with the dialog entered as such while the addition of multiparty side discussions may be considered a diverse interaction associated with the conventional interaction thus invoking a DIM such as DIM and so on.

Invocation or initiation of a DIM such as DIM may occur at the planned beginning of such interactions or at such time that a conventional interaction may become a diverse interaction with the addition of perhaps more than one party to the interaction. In one embodiment a transaction monitor or monitors such as are known in the art may be used to identify the number of parties in an interaction or perhaps the type of interaction based on enterprise rules and be adapted to notify a DIM such as DIM .

In one embodiment CINOS may be shared by distinctly separate organizations who must collaborate and provide infrastructure in order to complete a vast project or mission such as perhaps building and launching a space station. Many specialized groups involved in such a process may hold diverse interactions comprising multiparty discussions interactive seminars cost accounting meetings or other like collaboration without physically gathering to hold such meetings. Such implementations may be largely temporary and customized according to requirement. A DIM in this case would be responsible for identifying and providing instruction for entering and threading such dialog resulting from the multiparty interactions into a central repository shared by all participating organizations.

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention a unique programmable event handler is provided termed a specialized threading model STM by the inventor. In addition to logically inserting dialog from diverse interaction paths to associated customer threads and the like as described with reference to the section entitled Diverse Interaction Model it is also desirable to create special threads associations derived from stored and real time data records which may be used for temporary or ongoing research. Therefore an STM is provided as a programmable interface application which allows a researcher to find and study information shared within and through CINOS according to very specialized criteria.

The term Model as presented herein and associated with other COM based interface engines or applications such as the above described IOM DIM and IPM is used to describe COM based software models wherein functional software modules and or objects may be installed in order to create the larger functional software module which is called in the art a COM model. It will be apparent to the skilled artisan that functional modules as will be illustrated as located within an STM as taught below are not limited to residing within the described model but in many instances may be existing code sets or routines generic to CINOS and resident in other parts of interfacing software. These code sets or routines may be initiated or invoked by a module from within the described model as will be further explained below. It will also be apparent that the COM object implementation is exemplary and other programming techniques may be used within the spirit and scope of the invention.

A communication center data repository is provided for the purpose of warehousing data and is analogous to previously described repositories such as repository of . Repository is logically divided in many preferred embodiments into two sections for data storage. One section Text Based Data contains all of the communication center s threaded interaction dialog and text media. The other section MIS Database contains all of the recorded multimedia associated with the dialog stored in the text based section. It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that there may be additional repositories or databases held in separate locations on the CINOS network without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The inventor chooses to illustrate only one such repository for the purpose of simplifying explanation. Also indices to or abstracts of such databases may be used rather than databases themselves.

STM may access stored text data from repository Text Based Data section stored multimedia data from repository MIS Database and in some cases live text or multimedia data such as may be occurring during live interaction in a multimedia call center. Such live interactions as described and illustrated in this embodiment include interaction which is a chat room having four customers engaged in interactive communication for example in dialog concerning a mutually purchased product internal hosted by the enterprise . An interaction is illustrated and involves a customer and an agent wherein for example the customer has initiated the interaction incoming . An interaction is illustrated and involves two outside vendors wherein for example the vendors are subscribed to CINOS and discussing details of a joint just in time JIT shipment to the enterprise external . An interaction is illustrated and involves an agent and a customer labeled as such wherein for example the agent has initiated the interaction out bound .

Hereinafter the live interactions illustrated will be identified by the interaction type and the element number. For example interaction will be referred to as internal interaction . Interactions and will be referred to as incoming interaction external interaction and out bound interaction respectively. The interactions described above are all live and occurring during the run time of STM . All live interactions illustrated herein are entered into repository as illustrated via directional arrows emanating from each interaction in a direction toward repository . These stored interactions as the real time interactions are terminated become part of the stored database along with all previously stored interactions and annotated and text versions of such interactions.

As previously described STM may through a monitoring process described in more detail below access live data dialog and utilize such data at the time the data is created or more specifically before or at the same time that such data is either entered into text or recorded into multimedia repository . In this way a unique and innovative method is created whereby dialog associations may be created from stored data with additional dialogs being added to the association in real time as they occur with respect to live interactions such as those illustrated in this example. Such a process may be executed via STM and run in the background on a PC VDU such as PC VDU being used by researcher while other work is being performed. Similarly STM may reside in repository instead of PC VDU when not in use as illustrated via expansion arrows emanating from repository . That is the functionality may be client server based. In this case a CINOS connected agent may invoke STM remotely via PC such as PC VDU .

Referring back to STM is different from the diverse interaction model DIM as described with reference to in that it is expressly dedicated to creating new associations or dialog threads from those already created and from live interaction based on implicit instruction from a programmer which may be a knowledge worker agent researcher or any other authorized individual. Such associations may be stored in repository and displayed on a PC VDU such as PC VDU .

STM may be created in a generic COM container that is provided along with insertable modules in the form of a desk top or server based tool kit accessible to researcher . Once created an STM such as STM may be modified through editing for the purpose of performing another task which may differ from the original task. Several STM s such as STM may be created for different research projects and be run simultaneously within CINOS and share the same data and interfaces in an asynchronous multi tasking environment such as is attributed to CINOS routines.

In the example provided herein STM comprises insertable modules that are dedicated to performing certain functions or interfacing with and invoking certain physically separated functions or routines that are generic to CINOS. For example a search function module is provided and adapted to searching stored data for pre defined key words or phrases similar to the operation of known search functions or search engines used on the Internet or by other data functions. Again this function may be wholly within Model in some embodiments and Model may call the search function from CINOS in other embodiments.

Search function accepts input parameters entered by researcher such as a word word association phrase Model number and the like designed to associate otherwise unrelated dialogs. Additional input parameters that may be entered to search function include limits or constraints associated with the type of and area of data to be searched. For example if a desired keyword association parameter is disk drive problem install and the search area parameter is customer history database then search function will look for all dialogs containing the words disk drive problem an install that are stored in the customer history database.

Because threaded dialogs that may be stored in a multimedia communications center operating CINOS have markers or icons associating those dialogs to the actual stored media as previously described under the section entitled Rules Based Storage and Threading of Multimedia Interactions search function may be uniquely adapted to identifying these media icons and associating them with the specific dialogs for latter interaction.

An interaction monitor module is adapted to communicate with and send commands to various transaction monitors not shown that may be installed and operating within the CINOS operating system and adapted for monitoring live or recent interactions or transactions of various media types. For example one transaction monitor may be assigned to monitor incoming COST calls while another transaction monitor may be assigned to monitoring DNT interactions such as IP phone calls. Monitors may also be adapted to monitoring voice mails and other types of recorded voice messages. Furthermore text based monitors or text analyzers may be adapted to read and parse text based messages such as e mails faxes internal memos or any other text documents that may be made into digital files. In this way interaction monitor module may utilize the same input parameters assigned to search function module thereby extending it s functionality via command to such monitors and text analyzers assigned to live interactions as well as recent not live text transactions that have yet to be entered into a repository such as repository .

To illustrate one example of the method described above suppose that researcher has programmed one key phrase having a problem with into search function and programs interaction monitor module to interface the parameters via command to a monitor charged with monitoring incoming COST calls. Upon initiation of STM function will search stored data for the key phrase while module will instruct the incoming COST monitor to alert the researcher if the key phrase is detected during a live COST interaction. The scope of live interaction and recent transaction monitoring with regards to parameters set by researcher may vary according to the purpose of STM . The advantage of the above stated ability will be more apparent through further description provided below.

An IOM interface module gives researcher an option to access an abstraction of hard data or metadata instead of accessing actual hard data from repository as discussed with reference to the section entitled Stored Media Interface Engine Interaction Object Model . A notification interface module provides notification in the form of an audible alert pop up window or even an electronic page or other form of alert associated with events that may occur during execution of STM that may be of express interest to researcher . Such an alert or notification may occur if for example a period for running STM is nearing expiration or perhaps if a required monitor for live interaction is not on line. Notification interface may simply notify when a new dialog is added to an association of dialogs and so on. Module may also be programmed to alert multiple parties or a single party of the occurrence of any notable events that may take place during the execution of STM .

A thread builder module is an engine that creates a new thread or threads according to the parameters entered with respect to modules and . For example dialogs found by module that contain the input parameter key word word association or phrase are arranged and associated in a way that is logical to researcher and in accordance with entered input criteria. A dialog sorter module is provided to assist module in this function although in some embodiments one module may be created for both functions. Dialog sorter module may accept certain parameters for the purpose of organizing many separate unrelated dialogs according to programmed rules. That is in addition to being associated by the search parameter dialogs may be further organized by other input criteria.

In one embodiment dialog sorter module recognizes the time and date stamp for each dialog and organizes the dialogs adhering to that order. Thread builder then creates an abstract thread or tree structure associating the dialogs using interactive media icons and stores the new thread association in an unused section of repository where it may be later accessed. In another embodiment researcher. may enter overriding input parameters related to dialog sorter that may negate or override existing time and date stamps for a more preferable sorting criteria such as a sort by media association sort according to original thread identification and so on.

An interface command module may be installed for the purpose of accomplishing an interface to other CINOS systems such as routing messaging out dialing automated services and so on. A display function module allows an interactive picture of the newly created thread as organized and built via modules and to be displayed on a PC VDU such as the researcher s PC . The display may in one embodiment appear as an actual tree or thread connecting various interactive icons representing dialog and associated hard media. In another embodiment the display may be a simple list of interactive text titles. The nature of interaction with the display is such that by manipulating the interactive icons with a pointer device or by entering certain keyboard commands full text and hard media may be accessed and viewed by researcher from PC .

A hard media viewing module comprises the necessary viewers for accessing and displaying various media types that may be represented by dialogs and supported within the communication center. Module may instead of containing actual viewers simply contain command modules that invoke appropriate viewers installed on PC or otherwise accessible by the PC. Such automated execution modules as module enable the appropriate media viewer to be invoked without requiring manual initiation via PC .

A closing function module terminates execution of STM according to parameters entered by researcher . An example of a closing parameter might be to terminate after a given period of time such as one work period. Other parameters may be entered as well such as terminate when a goal number of target dialogs is reached and constructed on a thread and so on. Along with termination of STM created threads or associations may also be terminated or not depending on input parameters. For example time may be desired after a specialized thread is created for study purposes after STM has terminated it s operation. In this case perhaps a certain time period allotted for study will elapse before the thread is erased or purged from repository . In some cases the specialized thread may be permanently stored for review.

It should be apparent to one with skill in the art that the modules represented with respect to STM are only exemplary of the types of modules that may be used in creating STM . There may be more or fewer modules of different function and order without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover such modules may be executable routines within STM or simply command modules that notify and execute physically separate routines such as call monitoring routines or the like. In most embodiments a combination of resident modules and command modules may be used.

The advantages of STM are that specialized research or study may be conducted by an agent knowledge worker or researcher for practically any type of issue or problem relating to enterprise activity. For example an STM such as STM may be used to obtain information related to the success or failure of newly introduced products perhaps pointing to or indicating changes or revisions that may be desired by customers owning the products. STM may be used to gage success of a temporary promotion or advertisement by creating a specialized thread containing dialogs of all interactions about the promotion or advertisement taking place since such time that the promotion or advertisement was launched.

The unique capability of STM to access or intercept live interactions allows agents or researchers to monitor most recent dialogs associated with a subject of research. This innovative technique is especially useful in a fast paced sales organization wherein many different products are sold over a network. A researcher may chose one product as a subject for an STM such as STM . By running the application in the background he she may actively obtain all incoming dialogs related to purchasing that product with such dialogs appearing on a specialized thread in order of occurrence. By programming interaction monitor module with desired parameters he she may choose the type or types of supported media from which to select or search dialogs from.

Live interaction may be searched or parsed according to search parameters regardless of interaction type and media. For example internal interaction which in this embodiment is an open chat room may be parsed for any dialogs relating to the search subject entered as a parameter to search function . Incoming out bound and external communications in any supported media may be monitored and parsed for search parameters. External communication such as vendor to vendor as illustrated via external interaction may be monitored by CINOS in the event that they are connected to the CINOS network which in this case may be a network operating system shared by a group of separate organizations.

In the case of transcription of a media type as may be performed by a live attendant STM may notify the attendant which may for example send the newly created transcript to a text analyzer being commanded via STM . The transcript dialog may then be parsed and associated accordingly.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that an STM such as STM may be created to perform a wide variety of research tasks without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example an STM may be created to associate dialogs related to a fix to a technical problem as may be discussed among customers agents technicians or the like in chat rooms via COST interactions DNT interactions or any other supported media.

In one embodiment an STM such as STM may be used as a motivational tool for sales agents or the like. For example by searching dialogs from agent customer interactions for certain scripted phrases designed by the enterprise for improving customer relations or perhaps triggering a sale one may determine how often or to what extent these phrases are actually being used by which agents and so on. By comparing such accounts to the agents personal sales records one may obtain an indication of which phrases are more successful and so on.

Specialized threads created by STM may aid the enterprise in such areas as improving service increasing sales streamlining operations improving customer service planning future manufacturing or any other conceivable enterprise endeavor.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that one STM such as STM may be programmed to search according to any constraints with respect to media type area of search length of time allotted for ongoing dialog association and so on without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example one STM may search repository and only incoming e mails and faxes whereas another STM may be dedicated to obtaining dialog from incoming live interaction but not dialog history as may be stored in repository and so on. Also rather than just basic searches encompassing keywords etc. natural language or at their emergence multimedia search engines may be used that compare a concept to recorded voice video etc. There are many variant possibilities many of which will depend upon the type of enterprise and supported media.

According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention a communication center hosting CINOS according to various related embodiments of the present invention that have been previously disclosed herein is provided with a means for compiling data according to enterprise rules for the purpose of generating lists of potential contacts from stored enterprise data. More specifically in a preferred embodiment a COM based programmable application termed a dynamic campaign model DCM by the inventor is provided and adapted to monitoring sorting and categorizing all unanswered communication center inquiries regardless of media type and then to present contact lists based on such compiled information to communication center agents or to automatic dialers in a predetermined manner and in an automated fashion.

DCM is uniquely adapted to perform in the background during normal communication center activities. During peak periods wherein agents may be busy taking many live calls comprising orders or the like for the enterprise many lesser inquiries such as e mails requesting pricing or general inquiries about products or the like are left unresolved for the time being because much effort centers on taking in readily available business. Depending on the length and intensity of such a peak activity period unresolved inquiries may become quite numerous. Because all communication center interactions are persistently stored in a threaded multimedia database as previously described under the section above entitled Rules Based Storage and Threading of Multimedia Interactions DCM may access such data and analyze it according to enterprise rules.

DCM is programmed for a specific and dedicated function interacting with human supervisory on a PC VDU by one who is authorized such as an administrator at a station . The actual DCM may reside or co reside in any of the computers connected to the network. A directional arrow emanating from an on screen view of DCM on a PC VDU operated by administrator illustrates such capability by pointing to an expanded DCM . For example administrator may wish to initiate an outbound e mail campaign to all contacts having an e mail address as part of a customer care operation. In this sense there may be only one DCM programmed for a specific purpose such as initiating an outbound e mail campaign. However in other embodiments other DCM models programmed for other dedicated functions such as perhaps initiating an automated outbound telephony campaign may be in use. However it is also possible that a single DCM such as DCM may be programmed for multiple purposes.

An input command module allows an administrator such as administrator to set up desired parameters and areas of data to be searched for applicable contact information. For example DCM may be programmed to search a multimedia repository such as repository analogous to MIS of illustrated as connected to DCM via a two way arrow. A search function module provides functionality for searching and mining data based on input parameters entered into input command module . Input data into input command module may include but is not limited to parameters concerning a purpose for a planned campaign such as a title customer care e mail campaign search area parameters such as search all repositories for existing contacts having e mail addresses list name e mail address and brief description of inquiry and so on.

An IOM interface module allows DCM to search only meta data without having to physically access repository . Such capability is previously described with regards to the section entitled Stored Media Interface Engine Interaction Object Model . An IOM such as IOM of is continuously updated with respect to new and purged data. Therefore DCM may be programmed to check periodically and refresh according to recent updates. If programmed criteria for a search is not available via accessing the IOM then DCM may search hard data such as data stored in repository or in any other system connected repository or server.

As previously described DCM is programmed to run in the background during normal communication center activity. The reason for this is that at such a time when incoming traffic to the enterprise drops below a predetermined threshold DCM is in a preferred embodiment automatically activated in terms of further function and has all required data in such a state to be ready to distribute to agents so that no time is wasted. More regarding distributive function is provided below. The above mentioned activation may take place for example by the DCM at certain intervals monitoring levels of activity and when a preset threshold is crossed it starts the activity. Other methods may be employed such as having an alert function somewhere in CINOS or having an agent SW agent check activity and then alert DCM . Many other methods may be employed to reach such functionality and should be viewed as equal. Analogous recrossing of the threshold in the other direction may throttle or stop the campaign. A small hysteresis in levels for direction of crossing may be added.

An interaction sorter module is provided and adapted to sort interactions based on enterprise rules and input parameters to input command module . For example administrator may desire that all interactions be randomly sorted and divided evenly among several agents who will be assigned to the outbound campaign. In another example an administrator may desire that interactions be sorted by media type with agents assigned interactions of one media. In still another example it may be desired that interactions be sorted by statistical priority and distributed to agents with highest skilled agents receiving the higher priority contacts. It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that an application such as DCM may be programmed to virtually any type of out bound campaign according to any media type supported.

The interaction sorter module prepares a list for each assigned agent that contains the desired contacts and associated parameters according to enterprise rules and constraints as may be input by an administrator such as administrator . DCM continues to function in the background while interaction levels are above a preset threshold. Regular updating may occur during this background operation as contact s individual status may change according to programmed criteria. For example if a contact calls in and places an order his or her information may be removed from a list. As DCM is updated the prepared contact lists may change accordingly. For example if a contact was added to a list and then was purged from the repository system in between updates then that particular contact would be deleted from the list at the next update. In one embodiment DCM is updated in real time by constant interface with IOM of which was described as having a real time update feature with regard to .

An Interface command module is provided and adapted to accept input parameters regarding system execution of data provided by DCM . For example an administrator such as administrator may desire that prepared contact lists for an out bound campaign be routed to agent s PC VDUs via a system router such as routing system analogous to RTN of . Routing system is shown logically engaged to DCM via a double point arrow. Interface command module may also contain parameter options that designate other systems for receiving prepared lists such as e mail automated fax or the like. In one embodiment prepared lists may be routed to an automated out bound system such as an automated out bound dialing system whereby answered calls are connected to agents as incoming calls. There are many possibilities. It should be noted here that prepared lists would not be routed to any destinations until incoming interaction levels fall below a preset threshold at least in an automated embodiment. A routing interface module enables connection to designated routing systems or machines that will be used to route according to input instructions from module .

A traffic monitor is provided and adapted to monitor incoming traffic levels and to gauge such traffic against preset threshold levels. Traffic monitor may be provided in plural for monitoring separate media such as one for COST interaction one for IPNT interaction one for e mail interaction and so on. In one embodiment a single monitor such as monitor may be configured to monitor multiple media types. Traffic monitor is shown logically engaged via a double pointed arrow. DCM is notified to finish execution distribute lists based upon traffic levels as defined by a preset threshold. For example if a preset level is defined as a percentage of average interaction volume per day then a threshold report may reflect for example that incoming traffic in all media is currently at 40 of average.

When traffic monitor alerts DCM of a dip below the preset threshold for incoming traffic already prepared contact lists are distributed according to enterprise rules and administrative input as previously described. During the lull period time that incoming interaction levels remain below threshold DCM continues to update and monitor traffic via a system recheck module which invokes a response from traffic monitor . A separate recovery threshold may be initiated to which all interaction levels must rise before agents terminate their out bound campaign. For example if a low threshold of 40 of average is established for all incoming COST and IPNT interaction a recovery threshold may be set at 60 of average meaning that for agents to suspend their out bound campaign interaction levels with regards to COST and IPNT must surpass 60 .

If interaction levels rise beyond the preset threshold or if applicable the recovery threshold then DCM may terminate execution having completed distribution of contact lists including any updates. If updates are required during the lull after lists are distributed then additional amended lists or supplementary lists may be sent wherein additions or deletions are highlighted.

After DCM has distributed prepared contact lists and agents are engaged in out bound activity with contacts on lists an administrator may view agent progress on a PC VDU via a display function module . Display function module renders optional displays such as which agents are working on what lists current status of lists including resolution results if any and so on. In some embodiments an administrator or supervisor may supply modified script to agents who may be having trouble resolving issues such as perhaps obtaining an order.

A statistical interface module provides an interface to a statistical server such as an instance of a stat server on CTI processor of for the purpose of reviewing results of the campaign and comparing agent s performances. A closing function module provides an end to the execution of DCM such as by manual method or by automatic method after all contact distribution and reporting is complete. In closing any one of several procedures may be followed. For example all agents in the process may be instructed in closing to finish the lists provided before returning to other work or al remaining lists may be deleted.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that a dynamic campaign module such as DCM may be programmed to include any supported media type in terms of searched contact information as well as any supported media type for agent response. In a case where searched contact information includes media preferences for return calls then such preferences would be highlighted on an agent s list.

It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art that a DCM such as DCM may be used at any time within a communication center hosting CINOS without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example DCM may be used for an out bound campaign regardless of traffic level provided that there are available agents to receive lists.

A DCM model such as DCM may be programmed for one or more simultaneous out bound campaigns perhaps using different groups of agents for each separate campaign. The exemplary DCM as illustrated herein is but one example of such a dynamic out bound campaign application that may be created and implemented according to the various embodiments described.

In a further embodiment of the present invention a multimedia communication center MMCM operating CINOS according to various embodiments already described is provided with an innovative agent work presentation model AWPM that automatically personalizes and presents a suitable workload for an agent or agents based on enterprise rules and known information about an agent or agents such as skill level media preference or capability language capability rank of authority and so forth.

CTI communications equipment illustrated within PSTN network includes but is not limited to telephony switch enhanced via CTI processor running instances of T server and Stat server software IVR connected to processor by digital connection with CTI connectivity to switch established by CTI link as was disclosed in .

Internet network comprises IP router . Other network equipment including further routers not shown may be assumed to be present as was described with above. Connectivity to communications center from the network level is established by telephony trunk from PSTN and digital connection from Internet . For example telephony trunk connects switch to switch in center . Digital connection connects IP router to IP router switch within communication center .

Switch is CTI enhanced via processor and IVR . Processor is LAN connected LAN and switch connected CTI link . IVR is connected to processor by digital connection . Agent workstations each have a PC VDU and a switch connected telephone as represented in . These are PC VDU s and telephones . Each telephone is bridged to an associated PC VDU at each agent station by previously described connections. Alternatively the telephones may be integrated with the PC VDUs in other known ways. This enables agents to use their telephones to answer either COST calls or IP calls. Telephones are also connected to switch by internal telephone wiring . Direct LAN connection is established through each PC VDU at each agent station. LAN connected servers MIS and Server store multimedia interactions and CINOS management software respectively. The above brief description of the already described elements of that were reproduced here is intended only to simplify explanation of the added components according to an embodiment of the present invention.

In this embodiment a system administrator s station is provided and adapted to allow an agent supervisor or other authorized person or persons to build and implement the software of the present invention described below. Station comprises an administrator s PC VDU shown having an instance of an agent work presentation model AWPM in the process of being tooled for an agent. In practice any agent s workstation can be used as an administrator s station with the addition of the software of the invention.

Station may be provided as a single station or a plurality of such stations. Multiple stations may be utilized in a case where more than one supervisor or authorized person is needed to create many AWPM s. This may be the case with a large communication center employing a large number of agents or multiple centers not shown controlled by one system. Moreover other equipment may be present in station without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention such as a switch connected telephone or the like. In a preferred embodiment station is analogous to other administrator stations such as station of where applications or models of the present invention such as have been previously disclosed are tooled and implemented. In this exemplary embodiment station is connected to LAN .

AWPM is shown in the process of being created as previously noted. In a preferred embodiment AWPM is an editable and programmable COM based model that once complete may be stored and caused to execute in an automated fashion. As a COM based model AWPM may readily interact with other CINOS COM based applications without language conversion interfaces. However in other embodiments API s may be provided where language differences are present. A system tool kit not shown may be provided and adapted to build AWPM according to enterprise rules.

An agent information database server ADB is provided and stores data that is specific and identifiable to agents operating at communication center . For example agent ID agent skill parameters agent media preferences or capabilities agent language capabilities agent performance statistics agent licenses for providing certain restricted services and other like information may be stored in ADB . Such data is stored in a fashion so as to be personalized to each individual agent. In some embodiments more general information may cover a specific group of agents. In other embodiments such information may be stored for example in a smart card not shown which the agent then takes with him and upon starting his duty connects to a reader not shown and is then uploaded into the system while he is on duty.

Also stored in ADB are completed AWPM s . AWPM s represent completely tooled and executable COM based models such as completed representations of AWPM being created on PC VDU . Completed AWPM s may be stored on any LAN connected server other than server without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Similarly an agent database such as is stored on ADB server may also be stored on any suitable LAN connected server. In this exemplary embodiment a system administrator stores completed AWPM s on ADB for convenience only in that such applications are in close proximity to required agent data. However it is not specifically required to practice the present invention.

The building and implementation of AWPM s takes place internally within communication center as part of the workflow layer of CINOS described with reference to . An AWPM such as AWPM is programmed to accomplish certain goals with respect to individual agents or groups of agents such as those operating at stations in communication center . In a preferred embodiment there is one AWPM built and programmed for each agent however several agents may share one AWPM if the agents in question share suitably similar parameters or the shared AWPM is specifically programmed for that particular group of agents.

Generally speaking the job of an AWPM is to present workloads to individual agents or a group of agents based on known criteria about the agent or agents and enterprise rules. Workloads are defined for the purpose of the present invention as communication center duties normally handled by agents such as answering COST calls answering DNT calls answering e mails responding to other requests such as fax responses voice mails making marketing out calls and so on.

Varying workload presentation themes may be interwoven into an AWPM for any one or a group of agents. More familiar themes known in the art are a push theme and a blended push theme. The push theme typically employed in most current art centers involves simply pushing a workload of one type of media in serial fashion first in first answered on an agent until it is exhausted or sufficiently depleted. In some communication centers known to the inventor a push theme may be enhanced by adding more than one media type allowing an agent to switch back and forth by rule or discretion. More advanced themes known to the inventor include a publish and subscribe theme and an interrupt theme variation of the former . A publish and subscribe theme allows an agent to subscribe to workload queues that are published by the enterprise. In this way the agent may override certain enterprise rules or logic in order to enhance business. The interrupt theme simply allows an agent operating under a publish and subscribe theme to be interrupted by certain calls or duties according to enterprise rules.

By interweaving these various themes into a COM based model such as AWPM and allowing automated utilization of agent data stored in a repository such as ADB a system administrator has complete control over personalization and presentation of workload including media type to any one or group of agents. An administrator may additionally control the type and quantity of workload content that is presented as well as intervals or periods of time that an agent spends on any one or more duties.

When an agent such as one operating at station logs on to CINOS via LAN for example an AWPM such as one of stored on ADB executes and begins presenting his or her workload according to enterprise rules and latest agent information data. The executed AWPM is personalized to the agent or group of agents logging on. A unique aspect of the present invention involves the use of stored agent parameters. For example when executing an AWPM checks for the latest agent data in ADB and adjusts it s function according to any new data. In this way a supervisor or administrator need only update ADB to affect a change in an agent s workload or method of presentation. More about the unique function of an AWPM and it s relationship to other CINOS conventions will be provided below.

A LAN connection provides a shared connectivity to various CINOS systems and connected agents represented as agents A D. LAN is analogous to LAN of . Connected CINOS systems include but are not limited to a statistical server a routing system a queue monitor system system administrator station and ADB . Each of the above described systems may be employed as a single unit or as a plurality of associated units. For example queue monitor may monitor several queues or it may be a separate model generic to single or a few queues. In some cases the LAN may also be complemented by WAN connections to cover multiple sites not shown .

As a COM based model AWPM comprises a plurality of smaller software modules that enable various functions. In another embodiment AWPM may be a Java based application tooled with functional Java applets. A COM based model is used here because of convenience and interfacing capability with other COM based CINOS conventions.

An input module is provided and accepts programmed input from an author such as an administrator operating on PC VDU within station . Input data to module may include any enterprise rules and constraints including input parameters or instruction for other included modules within AWPM . For example constraints on media types allowed time intervals for specific workload presentation agent or agents identification parameters and so on may be included. A data access module DAM is provided and adapted to function as an interface to data storage systems such as may be hosted by CINOS including access to ADB . DAM is analogous to DAM of . Constraints applied to DAM may be input into AWPM through input module . Such constraints may include which data storage systems may be accessed and what information may be made available to AWPM .

Various media presentation modules are provided and adapted to provide instruction as to how workload will be presented to an agent or group of agents. These are a push module a push blend module a publish and subscribe module and an interrupt module .

Push module is adapted to accept input instruction such as what media type will be pushed to an agent as well as time constraints related to when and for how long a selected media type will be pushed. For example it may be that a certain agent such as agent B is a trainee and will only be allowed to answer e mails regarding general inquiries. In such a case perhaps only push module will be enabled with e mail inquiries as the selected media as long as agent B is classified as a trainee. Another more technical reason for a push model rule might be that an off site agent not shown due to limited line capacity will not get a video conference call even though he may have the skill profile required to handle the call.

It is important to note here that in an event that agent B is upgraded from a trainee to a level allowing more responsibility AWPM will access such updated data from ADB and automatically configure additional options for agent B the next time he logs on to CINOS. For example an administrator or authorized supervisor enters updated data into ADB concerning the new status of agent B such as a new media type allowed call parameters e.g. sales or service etc. associated with the selected media type time constraints regarding the new media and method of presentation for the new media. If for example the new media and call parameter is incoming COST service related calls and the method of delivery is input as push for a specific time period while retaining agent B s prior e mail responsibility then push blend module will take over and provide new instruction for agent B s new workload.

Push blend module involves pushing more than one media type for specific pre planed time periods. For example e mail may be pushed for one half of a work period while IPNT sales calls are pushed for the remainder of the work period. In some embodiments e mail COST calls and IPNT calls may be pushed for different time periods with overlapping time periods possible.

Publish and subscribe module involves an agent or group of agents such as one or more of agents A D subscribing to selected work queues of selected media types. For example agent D may be allowed to subscribe to COST calls from a specific queue while also subscribing to IPNT calls from a different queue. Time spent in each queue may be indicated as an enterprise rule time constraint. In another instance agent D may have complete control over time spent working each queue.

Interrupt module allows certain interactions of any media type to be pushed to an agent in prioritized fashion. An example of this would be if agent A is answering pushed e mails module but is interrupted interrupt module for sales calls when other agents are busy.

Modules have a capability of interacting with one another to provide virtually any combination of workload presentation according to any time constraint. Furthermore modules may coordinate function according to updated parameters input into ADB as previously described. In this way any authorized supervisor or other authority may update AWPM simply and efficiently. This unique capability is not known or available with prior art systems.

An agent information database interface ADB module functions to check ADB for any updates to workload assignments whenever an agent such as one of agents A D logs on to CINOS. If any updates are found modules act in concert to incorporate and adjust to the new rules. Modules are primary modules in terms of function within AWPM . That is to say that they are at the heart of AWPM .

Other modules provided to assist modules include a media interface module that is provided and adapted to disseminate parameters associated with media interactions such as may be stored in various communication center queues. Audio recognition and text parsing technology may be included in the capability of module thus enabling it to aid in the selection of interactions according to enterprise rules and agent data parameters stored in ADB . A routing system interface module provides interfacing capability to various CINOS routing systems . Internal routing of all interactions to agents such as agents A D is integrated with AWPM as required to effect various presentation options exemplified by modules .

A statistical interface module is provided and adapted to allow AWPM to access and report to Stat server . Such reporting may involve data regarding levels of success of a personalized AWPM specific to one agent or a group of agents. For example if one AWPM is implemented for a group of agents then a report May indicate any measure of improvement or degradation of overall service resulting from a supervisor varying workload presentation themes via updating ADB and affecting modules .

A display module is provided and adapted to allow human and machine readable information to be displayed on either agent s and or supervisor s PC VDU s as warranted. For example certain displays such as call interrupt alerts new media notifications or other instructions required to be communicated to an agent may appear as a pop up window or other form of graphic display. Supervisors may also receive or have access to displayable information such as performance statistics workflow queue contents agent or group activity reports and the like.

A dynamic campaign model DCM interface module is provided and adapted to allow AWPM to interact with DCM of . In this way pre planned out bound marketing campaigns may be conducted according to flexible presentation options offered by AWPM . For example lists containing out bound numbers and associated details may be treated as queued workload subject to push subscribe interrupt or a combination of these themes. Also an automated dialer may connect out bound calls and treat them as live incoming calls to be pushed to assigned agents as interrupt calls.

A log in start module is provided and adapted to wake up and execute AWPM when an agent logs on to CINOS. In one embodiment any one agent belonging to a group of agents covered by one AWPM such as AWPM may cause execution at the time of log on. If each agent in a group of agents has an ID associated with AWPM then a means for noting absent agents is provided. Such a means may be that ADB interface module recognizes which agents of the group are present according to ADB records.

A group AWPM can adjust it s process according to the actual number and identification of agents logged on or off. For example if there are 10 agents sharing one AWPM such as AWPM then the first to log on will cause execution with other agents being detected as they log on. Similarly when an agent in a group logs off the AWPM adjusts accordingly. With a group application an AWPM such as AWPM would check ADB for new agent data once for each agent logging on. A provision for recognizing a log off procedure for each agent in the group may be provided as part of log in module .

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that more or fewer modules of varying function may be added or subtracted to AWPM without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The mix of functional modules included herein is meant as exemplary only. For example modules may be provided as one module incorporating all included functions. A module responsible for reporting statistics may be added for the purpose of relaying queue status regarding certain media types to network level intelligent processors in order to aid pre routing of interactions.

It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art that the method and apparatus of the present invention may be used to communicate non queue related duties to specific agents such as perhaps conducting customer surveys making cold calls pricing orders and so on. In this case a list of contacts or recent requests for quote may be compiled and pushed to such an agent. Such duties may be integrated with normal customer response duties as previously described. An AWPM such as AWPM may be tooled for an individual agent or for a specific group of agents. An advantage of tooling for individual agents is that individual agent skills may be more fully exploited.

In yet another aspect of the present invention an innovative client interfacing self help wizard is provided to give clients or other CINOS users every available resource for solving product or issue related problems without requiring connection to a live agent or knowledge worker. Such a self help wizard is in this case provided as an editable COM based model which may be presented in an electronic WEB form such as in an on line catalog or in some other WEB based customer interface such as the previously described customer access window of . A self help wizard of the type disclosed herein is illustrated in section of window .

An object of the present invention is to provide optimum customer client assistance in a product or issue specific manner without taxing live resources or engaging in general dialog. The method and apparatus of the present invention is provided in enabling detail below.

In a broad sense wizard enables a client networking with a CINOS enhanced enterprise to gain access to a host of pre prepared automated responses that are tailored to specific products or services of interest to the client. In the case of an enterprise business associate such as an outside vendor those responses are tailored to the exact nature of the associate s business with the enterprise.

In a preferred embodiment wizard is configured to a specific client or enterprise associate and each client or associate for which specific data is maintained through the OS by the enterprise may have a dedicated wizard. Also in a preferred embodiment once configured a first time wizard configures itself through periodic updating based on client activity with an enterprise as determined through other CINOS conventions such as interaction history and threaded dialog accounts previously described as components of the CINOS system. For example if a client has purchased a particular model of a computer from the enterprise then his or her wizard is updated so that all automated responses accessed through individual modules are related to that particular model computer. Such modules illustrated as modules through are contained within wizard and are explained in more detail below. In some cases where this is not possible a program may be downloaded that analyzes the current system and then sends the wizard an updated status.

As previously described wizard comprises a plurality of functional modules designed to provide interface with various CINOS automated systems comprising a variety of supported media types. In this way a client may select a desired media in which an automated response may be reviewed or an interactive display can be viewed. In a preferred embodiment such responses may arrive to a client via a data connection through the client s system or via a client maintained COST connection such as a normal telephone. Such flexibility affords a client many options for obtaining and receiving automated service.

It should be noted here that the instance of utilizing a WEB form for presenting options of wizard should not be construed as a limitation but rather as a preferred convenience that offers a wide variety of media options for a customer or client. A CTI version of wizard may be presented to a client via an enterprise controlled IVR access point wherein the various options are simply activated by voice response.

Referring back to an input module is provided and adapted to enable an author of wizard such as a system administrator to add voice and text script to various sections of wizard . Such scripting may be related to the general function of wizard such as directions for use labels interactive options dialog to the customer and so on.

A digital IVR module is provided and adapted to enable a link to a digital IVR containing pre scripted options which may be presented to a client. A client may then interact with an IVR using known conventions such as via keyboard input or if equipped voice input through a connected DNT application. A COST IVR module is provided and adapted to provide a telephony link to a COST IVR containing pre scripted interactive options directed toward the client. In one embodiment a client may click on module and shortly thereafter receive a COST call on his telephone from the COST IVR. In another embodiment connection may be established from the client s computer via a telephony application such as an IP phone.

Pre scripted options and messages are defined for the purpose of this invention as text or voice directives or options created by the enterprise and presented to a client based on his or her most recent activity with the enterprise. Such options and messages are designed to generically fit specific products or services obtained by a customer of the enterprise. They may include all manner of instruction direction or any other prepared directive or message deemed appropriate by the enterprise for presentation to a client or customer.

In some embodiments pre scripted options or messages may take the form of video and may be viewed with a client s media viewer. Pre scripted options or messages may be presented to a client customer or business associate according to any desired and supported media as is explained below.

IVR presentations and options are tailored to most recent business transacted by a client or customer. For example all clients who recently have purchased a specific product such as a particular model computer would be presented those interactive presentations created for that product if they choose module or . Because all CINOS interactions are recorded and stored according to previously described CINOS conventions most recent information about clients such as most recent purchases and the like are available to CINOS maintained IVR systems. Therefore pre scripted IVR options specific to certain products or services may be called up from a stored collection of such scripts based on client ID and referenced information. In this way a particular client s offered IVR options may automatically change according to his or her most recent activity and transactions with the enterprise.

An E mail module is provided and adapted to enable a link to an automated e mail system wherein pre scripted e mails may be pushed to the client that contain instructions or other resolute material associated with a purchased product or service. Pre scripted E mails may be chosen from a pool similar to IVR scripts described above. For example by clicking on module a CINOS automated E mail system references client information and sends the appropriate message or messages related to latest activity. If for example a client has recently subscribed to a cable service the E mail may contain cable set up and tuning instructions as well as a channel guide and optional channel packages.

A Fax module is provided and adapted to enable a link to an automated FAX service. The parameters associated with scripted messages and referenced client information are the same for FAX module as with IVR modules and and E mail module . That is the pre scripted messages chosen are based on CINOS customer ID and most recent activity information about the client. Virtually any CINOS supported media may he used to deliver pre scripted options and messages to a client customer or business associate.

A product presentation interactive PPI module is provided and adapted to enable a client or customer to view specific interactive presentations regarding products or services. Such PPI s include but are not limited to video presentations surround video interactives graphic slide shows video audio presentations etc. For example by clicking on PPI module a surround video illustrating the inside components and connections of a client s purchased computer may be presented. By directing a cursor with a pointer device a client may cause the display to move to a desired area and allow for zooming in on the selected area. There are many possibilities.

A WEB link module is provided and adapted to enable linking to offered WEB pages containing information relevant to a clients recent purchase or obtained service. All types of known media presentation forms are possible such as FAQ sheets Instruction guides specific interactive chats and so on. Providing client linking to additional information pages is common practice in the art of on line business.

In a preferred embodiment all offered help through linking to WEB pages is controlled by a CINOS enhanced enterprise including maintenance of additional WEB pages. However in some embodiments resident information found anywhere on the WWW may be linked to Wizard if deemed appropriate by the enterprise. Such a case may be that a product or service is offered by the enterprise with service being the responsibility of a third party.

An order module is provided and adapted to enable a client to order products related to a recent purchase or ordered service. Interaction with module may initiate orders for spare parts or accessories associated with a main purchase made by a client. In some embodiments module may allow ordering using a media chosen by a client such as e mail or FAX. In a preferred embodiment module is dedicated to aiding a client by presenting pre designed order forms related to a client s most recent main purchase or obtained service such as for replacement parts optional accessories changes in a service order or the like.

When a client or customer places a new main order for a primary product Or service he will likely use a separate order wizard such as one illustrated in section of customer access window of . When CINOS detects the new order module may be automatically updated to reflect new order options for parts or accessories related to the new or most recent purchase.

In some embodiments new pre scripted options and messages including interactive order forms and the like are simply added to wizard instead of replacing older data. In this way a client may utilize wizard to obtain self help data regarding more than one recently purchased product. A time constraint may also be applied to wizard such that old data associated with a product or service may be automatically disassociated from wizard . In this way wizard is kept current with a client s needs. If a client or customer requires help with long owned product or service then he or she may request that wizard be up dated with the appropriate options and pre scripted messages.

A desktop interface module is provided and adapted to act as an interface to a client or customer s WEB browser. A CINOS client application may be provided and adapted to include API s to specific client communication and viewer applications installed on his or her computer station to allow client participation with offered media presentations or interactives. In this way offered media types may be viewed by a client even if the client does not have a particular main program application installed. Specialized media viewers Word document format converters text viewers and similar conventions may be part of the client browser plug in.

A media support module is provided and adapted to contain required media drivers for executing different types of media presentations offered. For example if wizard is updated to include a new type of media an appropriate driver would be installed in module . Module contains an appropriate driver for each type of offered media as required. In one embodiment such drivers may also be downloaded to a client s browser through desktop interface module . There are many variable options.

A data access module is provided and adapted to enable wizard to access updated information from any supported hard data repository. An IOM interface enables similar access to abstract metadata such that most information may be obtained without actually accessing a repository. A system report module is provided and adapted to interface with a reporting system such that and use of wizard may be statistically calculated and reported to wizard authors or other enterprise entities. Such reporting may help to more effectively design various self help scripts and presentations. In one embodiment a ratio of the number of clients successfully using wizard to the number that accessed the wizard but ultimately required live assistance could be reported. Such reporting helps to improve the overall process.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that there maybe more or fewer modules accessible through wizard than are shown here without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The above example is intended solely as one example of a functional self help wizard that may be tailored to aiding clients with specific products or services. A self help wizard such as wizard may be provided as part of a customer interface such as window of an on line catalog or as part of an on line after purchase program or tutorial. In one embodiment the functional options of wizard may be provided as a CTI application and presented through a COST customer interface such as an IVR access point maintained by a CINOS enhanced enterprise.

It will be apparent to one with skill in the art that CINOS may be implemented in a single communication center or in a plurality of communication centers linked via WAN without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

It will also be apparent to one with skill in the art that rules may be created which govern access to CINOS without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example customers may be required to subscribe to CINOS and may also be provided with a customer application enabling such access. In another embodiment access may be given to the general public according to established security rules governing commerce financial transactions and other processes.

There are many existing and future implementation opportunities for an interaction operating system such as CINOS many of which have already been stated. The spirit and scope of the present invention is limited only by the claim that follow.
