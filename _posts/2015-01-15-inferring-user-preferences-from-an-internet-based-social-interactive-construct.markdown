The present invention is related to collective knowledge systems and more specifically to providing natural language computer based topical advice based on machine learning through user interaction.

Online searching for topical advice represents a significant use of computer resources such as provided through the Internet. Computer users may currently employ a variety of search tools to search for advice on specific topics but to do so may require expertise in the use of search engines and may produce voluminous search results that take time to sift through interpret and compare. People may be accustomed to asking other people for advice in spoken natural language and therefore it may be useful to have a computer based advice tool that mimics more closely how people interact with each other. In addition advice on topics may change in time and any static database of advice may fall quickly out of date. Therefore a need exists for improved topical advice search capabilities adapted for use with natural language and that provides for continuous content refinement.

The present invention may consist of a computing facility such as a machine learning facility that may ask a user questions and based on the user s answers the system may offer a decision such as a recommendation a diagnosis a conclusion advice and the like. Internally the system may use machine learning to optimize which questions to ask and what decision to make at the end of the question and answer dialog. The system may learn through users providing feedback on the provided decision including deciding whether the decision was helpful or not. Helpful decisions may become reinforced and become associated with the questions and answers that were asked along the way. When a user indicates that a decision was helpful the system may remember which questions it asked what the answer to each question was and may associate these questions and answers with the ultimate decision. In embodiments these associations may be the basis of the machine learning that may learn over time which question to ask the next time a user comes to the system.

In embodiments the present invention may help a user make a decision through the use of a machine learning facility. The process may begin with an initial question being received by the machine learning facility from the user. The initial question may be received via a search interface where the ultimate decision is based on the initial search terms the dialog of questions and answers with the user the training in the system and the like. The user may then be provided with a dialog consisting of questions from the machine learning facility and answers provided by the user. The machine learning facility may then provide a decision to the user based on the dialog and pertaining to the initial question such as a recommendation a diagnosis a conclusion advice and the like. In embodiments future questions and decisions provided by the machine learning facility may be improved through feedback provided by the user.

In embodiments the initial question posed to the user may be an objective question a subjective question and the like. A question may be provided from amongst a broad category of topics such as topics pertaining to a product personal information personal health economic health business politics education entertainment the environment and the like. The question may be in the form of a multiple choice question a yes no question a rating a choice of images a personal question and the like. The question may be about the user provided by another user provided by an expert and the like. The question may be based on a previous answer such as from the current dialog with the user from a stored previous dialog with the user from a stored previous dialog with another user. The question may be a pseudo random question such as a test question an exploration question that helps select a pseudo random decision on the chance that the pseudo random decision turns out to be useful and the like. The question may include at least one image as part of the question. The question may be along psychographic dimensions. In embodiments the question may not be asked directly to the user but rather determined from contextual information such as through an IP address the location of the user the weather at the user s location a domain name related to path information related to a recent download related to a recent network access related to a recent file access and the like.

In embodiments the dialog may continue until the machine learning facility develops a high confidence in a reduced set of decisions such as a reduced set of decisions presented to the user a single decision presented to the user. The decision provided by the machine learning facility may be independent of the order of questions in the dialog. The decision may provide an alternate decision when at least one question in the dialog is omitted where the alternate decision may be different based on the machine learning facility having less information from the user. The decision may display a ranking of decision choices such as ranking decisions across non traditional feature dimensions. The decision may display at least one image related to the decision. The decision may be a pseudo random decision on the chance that the pseudo random decision turns out to be useful such as the pseudo random decision being part of a system of exploration where the system of exploration may improve the effectiveness of the system the machine learning facility may learn from exploration and the like.

In embodiments the feedback provided may be related to or derived from how the user answers questions in the dialog how the user responds to the decision provided by the machine learning facility and the like. In embodiments the feedback may be solicited from the user.

In embodiments users may extend the learning of the machine learning facility by entering new information where the new information may be their own topic question answer decision and the like. The machine learning facility may use the new information to determine whether the new information is helpful to users.

In embodiments expert users may extend the learning of the computational facility by entering new information where the new information may be their own topic question answer decision and the like. An expert user entering a new question answer or decision may specify how the system should rank the decisions when future users give particular answers to the question. The expert user may also specify pre conditions dependencies on when the new question should be asked. The expert user may also optionally enter an importance for the question.

In embodiments the system may be implemented as a series of dynamic decision trees. During the question and answer dialog with the user the system may be looking at which questions are relevant to ask given the answers the user has already provided. When users enter new questions answers or decisions they may specify which questions are relevant to which decisions and how the answers affect the relative ranking of the various decisions.

In embodiments the system may recommend a decision based on multiple independent factors such as how well a decision matches the objective requirements specified by the user during the question and answer dialog and how well the decision matches the user s subjective requirements such as the user s taste preferences.

In embodiments a user interface may be provided for user interaction with the machine learning facility such as associated with a web interface instant messaging a voice interface a cell phone with SMS and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may help a user make a decision through the use of a machine learning facility. The process may begin with an initial question being received by the machine learning facility from the user where the initial question may be associated with one of a broad category of topics such as product personal health business political educational entertainment environment and the like. The user may then be provided with a dialog consisting of questions from the machine learning facility and answers provided by the user. The machine learning facility may then provide a decision to the user based on the dialog and pertaining to the initial question such as a recommendation a diagnosis a conclusion advice and the like. In embodiments future questions and decisions provided by the machine learning facility may be improved through feedback provided by the user.

In embodiments the present invention may help a user make a decision through the use of a computing facility. The process may begin with an initial question being received by the computing facility from the user. The user may then be provided with a dialog consisting of questions from the computing facility and answers provided by the user. The computing facility may then provide a decision to the user based on an aggregated feedback from a plurality of users. In embodiments the computer facility may improve future questions and decisions provided by the computing facility based on receiving feedback from the user.

In embodiments the present invention may help a user make a decision through the use of a machine learning facility. The process may begin with an initial question being received by the machine learning facility from the user. The user may then be provided with a dialog consisting of questions from the machine learning facility and answers provided by the user where the number of questions and answers provided through the dialog may determine the quality of the decision. The machine learning facility may then provide a decision to the user based on the dialog and pertaining to the initial question such as a recommendation a diagnosis a conclusion advice and the like. In embodiments future questions and decisions provided by the machine learning facility may be improved through feedback provided by the user. In embodiments the quality may be high when the number of questions and answers large such as greater than 10 questions greater than 15 questions greater than 10 questions and the like. In embodiments the quality may be good quality when the number of questions and answers is small such as less than 10 questions less than 5 questions less than 3 questions one question and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may make a decision through the use of a machine learning facility. The system may include a machine learning facility that may receive an initial question from the user a dialog facility within the machine learning facility providing the user with questions and accepting answers from the user the machine learning facility providing a decision to the user and the like. In embodiments the decision provided to the user may be based on the exchange between the user and the machine learning facility and pertain to the initial question. Further the machine learning facility may receive feedback from the user to improve future questions and decisions provided by the machine learning facility.

These and other systems methods objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the drawings. All documents mentioned herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.

While the invention has been described in connection with certain preferred embodiments other embodiments would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art and are encompassed herein.

The present invention may ask the user questions and based on the user s answers the system may offer a decision such as a recommendation a diagnosis a conclusion advice and the like. Internally the system may use machine learning to optimize which questions to ask and what decision to make at the end of the process. The system may learn through users giving feedback on the ultimate decision whether the decision was helpful or not. Helpful solutions may get reinforced and associated with the questions and answers that were asked along the way. When a user says that a decision was helpful the system may remember which questions it asked what the answer to each question was and may associate these questions and answers with the ultimate decision. These associations may be the basis of the machine learning that learns over time which question to ask the next time a user comes to the system.

For example a user may try to get advice picking a bar to visit. The system may ask the question How old are you and get the answer in my 30s . Ultimately the system may show the user the decision Kelley s Irish Bar . Assume the user says this decision was helpful. The system will increase the association between the question How old are you the answer in my 30s and the decision Kelley s Irish Bar . The next time a user comes to the site looking for advice on a bar the system will be more likely to ask the user the How old are you question since in the past this question was useful in helping the user. If the user answers the question in the same way as the prior user saying in my 30s then the system will increase its belief that the ultimate decision is Kelley s Irish Pub .

The system may build a profile of each user s tastes aesthetic preferences etc. and learn via feedback which decisions are liked by which types of people. Alternatively an expert user may specify which kinds of decisions are liked by which kinds of people. Learning user s taste profiles may happen through a separate process from the dialog of questions and answers asked by the system in a specific topic. For example a user may separately tell the system about their taste choices through a different question and answer dialog designed specifically to understand the user s aesthetic preferences.

A user may not want to spend the time to teach the system about all of their taste preferences and so instead the system may learn or an expert may specify which of all the taste questions are the most important taste questions to ask in the context of the user making one specific decision . Out of the universe of all questions the system may know about finding out about taste profiles for instance the system may have learned there are three specific questions that are best for when the user is trying to find a sedan under 25 000. Alternately there may be a completely different set of three taste questions to ask a user who is interested in a SUV over 45 000.

A user may also only tell the system about their taste preferences and not about any objective questions. In this case the system may provide a ranking of all the decisions in an area of advice based purely on taste. So instead of the user saying they want a 200 point and shoot camera effectively what the user would be doing is saying they want a camera that other urban 35 year old men who prefer computers to sports want. Users may indicate this preference by using a search interface and choosing an area of advice that is explicitly labeled cameras for urban men in their 30s instead of the which camera should I buy area of advice. Alternatively users may indicate their interest in making a decision about cameras and then opt to not answer any of the questions in the Q A dialog from the system and thus the system will only have subjective information about the user to use in recommending cameras to the user . Alternatively users may answer questions in the dialog that are both objective and subjective and the system may then recommend a camera based on the combined objective data about the camera and subjective data about the camera.

Users may also enter new questions answers and ultimate decisions. The system may then try out the new questions with future users to see if the questions turn out to be useful in helping those users. For example a user of the bar recommendation service may contribute the question Do you want a loud place or a quiet intimate setting . The system may decide to ask this question in a future use of the bar recommendation service and through the process outlined above observe a correlation between the answers of this question and recommendations that users find useful. On the other hand a user may contribute a question that has no value in helping users. For example a user could contribute the question Do you have a Canon camera . The system may try this question out on future users and fail to notice any correlation between the answers to this question and bar recommendations that users find helpful. In this case the question may get asked less since it s not predictive of whether one recommendation or another recommendation is helpful.

The system may keep asking questions until it feels it has a high confidence in a few possible decisions. The system may also stop sooner if it feels like it has already asked too many questions and risks annoying the user. The system may also ask at least a minimum number of questions to avoid the user feeling that the system couldn t possibly have asked enough to make an intelligent decision.

The system may have a mechanism to tolerate incorrect answers from the user. Incorrect answers may result from the user not understanding the question not understanding the answer or not knowing the answer to the question. If the bulk of the answers given by the user support a particular decision the system may make that decision even though not all the user s answers support that decision.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for at least one of questions and answers between the system and the user decisions to users and machine learning utilized to improve decisions. The system may provide for an improved way to generate questions and answers an improved way to provide decisions to users an improved way to utilize machine learning to improve questions and decisions provided by a system and the like where any of these capabilities may be separately or in combination used as a standalone system or incorporated into a third party system as an improved capability. In embodiments each of these improved capabilities may utilize some form of machine learning as described herein. For example the system may provide for an improved way to execute a question and answer session with a user by learning under what circumstances the user is looking for certain information. For instance it may be learned by the system that the weather is a condition under which users have a differentiated preference depending on the time of day and the weather conditions. When it s raining during the day and a user searches for movies the user may be more likely to be looking for movie tickets and locations where the movie is playing. When it s raining during the night and the user searches for movies the user may be more likely to be looking for a description of the movie. In another example the system may provide for an improved way to provide decisions to users such as learning that users prefer certain formats during the daytime versus during the evening providing choices verses a single decision based on age prefer a greater number of questions prior to presentation of the decision based on the user s geographic location and the like. In another example the system may provide for an improved way to learn what decision to choose for a user such as utilizing greater expert information based on age and education utilizing popular opinion more when the topic is fashion and the user is young versus utilizing traditional practice more when the user is older asking more questions about the user s choices in friends when the topic is personal and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for combinations of question and answer providing decisions and learning what decisions to provide where one of the elements may not be provided by the system such as when that element is provided by a third party system. For example a third party search engine web application may what to improve their capabilities for providing sorted lists from a user s search query and so may want to utilize the present invention s facility for generating questions and answers to augment their keyword search and sort algorithms. In this instance the third party search engine provider may not be interested in the present invention s facility for generating decisions because their service is in the business of providing sorted lists not a limited set of decisions. However the present invention may provide an important new capability to the search engine provider in that the present invention s ability to constantly improve the questions and answers to users may enable the search engine provider to improve their sorting result to users based on the present invention s capabilities.

In embodiments the subject of the initial area of advice may be specified through a search interface. For example a user searching for romantic honeymoons in Italy may get taken to a web page that helps the user decide where to honeymoon in Italy instead of first asking the user questions about where they want to vacation what type of vacation they were looking for etc. Or a user could search for a specific location in Italy and be directed to a web page on that 1 helps the user decide if that specific location is a good one for their needs for example showing things like this vacation is good for honeymooners and romantic getaways and bad for family vacations and 2 offers to start a dialog to help the user find alternative and potentially better locations in Italy to vacation. Or a user could be searching for specific products and then enter into a dialog to narrow down which of those products are best for them. In both cases 1 and 2 the information shown may be based how other users have answered questions in decision making dialogs and then given positive feedback to this decision. So if many people using the where should I go on vacation topic answered a question do you want a romantic vacation with yes and then gave positive feedback to Italy the system would display that Italy is a romantic destination to users coming in via search engines. Alternatively the users who added the decision Italy or the question do you want a romantic vacation into the system could have explicitly indicated that the answer yes to the question do you want a romantic vacation should be associated with Italy and thus show that Italy is a romantic vacation to users coming in via search engines.

In embodiments the present invention may provide other combinations of some subset of asking questions making decisions and learning to make better decisions such as using the present invention s facilities for making better decisions but only using input from experts not providing a question and answer session for a particular user but rather utilize previous user interactions with the system to provide decisions asking questions and answers to a user to allow the system to learn in association with future decisions but providing rewards to the user rather than decisions asking question and answers and making a decision without any learning such as simply filtering down results utilizing the present invention s ability to learn how to make a better decision but providing that capability to an expert system rather than to users through a question and answer interface and the like. In embodiments the system may provide for all the elements of a question and answer user session providing decisions to the user and learning how to improve decisions.

In embodiments a user entering a question may optionally specify dependencies and importances for the question. Dependencies may control when the question can be asked. Importances may specify relative importances between different questions for weighing a user s answers. If the system has to make trade offs because no one decision result matches all of the answers specified by a user the system may try to recommend decision results that match high importance questions over lower importance questions. The system may also prioritize asking high importance questions over low importance questions. For example a user entering a new question like Where in the United States do you want to vacation set a dependency that requires an existing question such as Where in the world do you want to go to have been answered with The United States before the new question Where in the United States do you want to vacation can be asked.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a system with a user interface through which the user may interact with the facilities of the system. The system may include several parts some of which may be the website the supervisor and a collection of widgets. Widgets may be collections of code that collect process and render a single piece of content on the website. The website may consist of interfaces for end users staff members and registered users to get decisions edit the decisions and view reports on system performance. The supervisor may be a container for running widgets so that a widget can perform time consuming data collection and processing ahead of user requests to render that content.

For example a widget might collect videos about decisions from the internet. The widget in the supervisor might crawl the web looking for videos about each decision and store videos it finds in a database. When the user comes to the website and gets a particular decision the website may ask the video widget to render itself and display any videos it has previously found.

A plurality of instances of the supervisor may be running on multiple computers in order to scale up the widget s processing. Each widget may be running on its own computer. Similarly many computers may be providing interfaces to the system through web servers instant messaging voice gateways email programmatic APIs via being embedded in third party websites and the like.

In embodiments attributes may be combinations of a question and one particular answer to that question. For example if a question was How old are you and the answers to that question were under 18 20 30 and over 30 then an attribute would be How old are you Under 18 . The system may work by learning the relationship between attributes and decisions. When the system asks a question and the user gives an answer then the system may take that attribute and see which decisions are associated with it.

In embodiments the system may understand that some attributes represent continuous values while others represent discrete values. When using continuous attributes the system may be able to make more intelligent tradeoffs such as understanding that it is frequently acceptable to recommend a product that costs less than the user asked for but rarely acceptable to offer a product that costs more than the user asked for.

In embodiments the relationships between attributes and decisions may be learned from users explicitly given to the system or some combination of the two and the like. For example a price attribute of How much do you want to spend Under 200 might be explicitly linked to cameras that fall into that price range based on data from experts ecommerce sites APIs etc. The relationship between the attribute How will you use the camera On vacations and possible vacation destinations might be fully learned however.

When entering new questions answers and results the user may optionally specify the relationships between attributes and decision results. For example if a user were to enter the question how much do you want to spend in the which camera should I buy topic the user may also specify to the system that the answer under 200 should be associated with cameras X and Y but not camera Z. Then if a future user were to use the which camera should I buy topic and were to answer the how much do you want to spend question with the answer under 200 that user may have a higher chance of being recommended camera X and Y over camera Z.

After seeking advice from the system and receiving a decision result a user may also be given reasons from the system as to why that particular decision result was recommended. This explanation may also allow the user to change the attributes for the decision result if the user believes that the decision result was recommended in error by the system.

In general the relationships learned may involve training from users experts employees automated data feeds from third parties or some combination.

In embodiments there may be various ways that the system can recommend a solution and select the next question to ask the user. Possible machine learning systems may be geometric systems like nearest neighbors and support vector machines probabilistic systems evolutionary systems like genetic algorithms decision trees neural networks associated with decision trees Bayesian inference random forests boosting logistic regression faceted navigation query refinement query expansion singular value decomposition and the like. These systems may be based around learning from complete game plays e.g. all attributes given by a user before getting a decision the answers to individual questions subsets of game plays only positive feedbacks only negative feedbacks or some combination of the two. Additionally the system may take into account previous interactions the user had such as remembering previously answered questions decisions that the user liked or did not like which areas of advice the user previously sought advice in etc. Additionally the system may take into account factors that are implicitly provided by the user such as time of day and date the user used the system the user s IP address client type e.g. Firefox IE cell phone SMS and the like and other such data.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a machine learning system that goes well beyond the capabilities of collaborative filtering such as through explicitly asking questions instead of implicitly learning based on a user s behavior which may be much more powerful since the system is not left trying to infer the user s intent mood etc. Also choosing the questions to ask the user based on what they ve already answered may allow the present invention to zero in on nuances that would otherwise be missed. The present invention may have the ability to explain decisions such as providing decisions beyond simple extrapolations form past behavior such as in other people who bought X Y and Z also liked product A . Instead the present invention may be able to say the user should do A because the user said they wanted X liked Y and believed Z . In addition the present invention may allow users to contribute new questions that may be useful and then automatically learn under which contexts if any the question is helpful. In another area of difference the present invention s machine learning technology may be able to provide decisions in a great variety of user interest areas where collaborative filtering has difficulties being applied to non product media applications. For instance collaborative filtering would not be easily applied to helping a user make a decision on a highly personal topic such as whether they should get a tattoo or a rare question such as whether a particular expense can be deducted on the user s tax return. The present invention may be capable of such applications. In embodiments the present invention may be able to use pre programmed expert advice inter mixed with advice learned from a group of users to make decisions to users.

In embodiments the system may have a wiki web interface for editing all of the data on the system. The web interface may be used to edit create delete questions answers attributes and solutions. Each solution may also have a variety of information associated with it which may be shown on the decision page when that solution is recommended. For example when recommending a vacation in Cancun the recommendation page might show videos about Cancun. All of this ancillary data about the solution may also be editable through the wiki.

In embodiments the wiki may be used to edit data collected by widgets running in the supervisor. This may allow the widgets to collect data ahead of time and then have a human quality assurance process to review and change the collected data.

In embodiments the system may maintain a history of all changes made by either the widgets or humans. For example one use of this history may be to review the work done by hired contractors doing content quality assurance. Another use of this history may be making sure that the widgets do not undo work done by humans. For example if the widgets collect a particular video and a human deletes that video because it is inappropriate then the widget can use the history to not re add that video again sometime in the future. Finally if data is corrupted or incorrectly deleted the history may allow a means of recovery.

In embodiments when widgets find new content they may queue tasks to a human workflow for validating and editing that content.

In embodiments in order to learn the system may sometimes make random or semi random decisions in hopes of recommending something that the system wouldn t have expected to be useful but which may turn out to be useful. If the system wants to use what it has already learned then it may not make random choices in which questions it asks and which decision it makes. There may be a tradeoff between using what is already known also referred to as exploitation and potentially learning something new also referred to as exploration. Exploitation may lead to a more satisfied user while exploration may make the system smarter.

In embodiments one way to make this trade off when selecting questions to ask the user may be to ask questions that the system is confident are useful in making a decision and then picking a few random questions to ask. Another way to make the trade off may be to have a fixed budget in every user interaction where a fixed set of questions are based on exploitation and the next set are based on exploration.

In embodiments decisions may also be explored or exploited. If the system wants to learn it may show a random decision. Instead of showing a purely random decision the system may also show a decision that meets some requirements specified by the user and is purely exploring within the remaining requirements. For example instead of picking a random camera to show the user the system could pick a random camera that meets the user s price requirements. This may result in more efficient training since the system may be less likely to show a decision that has no chance of meeting the user s needs. Rather than showing a random decision when exploring the system may also show both the exploited decision and an explored solution and get feedback on each separately from the user. Alternatively the system could inject a limited amount of randomness and pick a decision like what the system s best guess is. For example the system may predict that the user will like one particular camera but could instead recommend another similar but not identical camera in order to balance making a reasonable decision and still learning new information from the user. In embodiments the system may identify to the user when it is asking questions or making decisions through exploration vs. exploitation or it may not.

In embodiments the system may be viewed as surveying users about the various things it is recommending. For example the system may ask the user questions about the Canon SD1000 camera. This may provide a rich set of data about each camera allowing the system to start building lists of what kind of user is likely to like this camera. The system may build a ranked list of decisions for each attribute such as from most likely to be liked to least likely to be liked given that attribute. For example the system may build a list of cameras in order likely to be liked by people who say How old are you Over 50 . This may be shown by the system as the top 10 cameras for users over 50. Numerous of these top 10 lists may be constructed based on the system s data. These lists may also be combined to form new lists. For example given the ranked lists of cameras for the attribute How old are you Over 50 and another list for the attribute Why are you buying a camera Travel the system may construct a new ranked list of cameras for the Over 50 year old users who want a travel camera . These combinations of top lists may be pre generated generated on demand by incrementally asking the user to select new top lists and the like.

In embodiments these top lists may be used for a variety of purposes. Some users may not want to answer a series of questions before receiving a decision. Instead they may be able to browse through these lists and find a relevant decision. The system may have a large number of top lists such as thousands or tens of thousands each of which may have their own web page. In addition these pages may contain a large amount of content that may be indexed by search engines and bring users to the system s website. Alternatively users may use a search interface in the system itself to find the area of advice they want a decision in. Various top lists may be used to short cut the dialog by implicitly answering some of the questions in the dialog based on the toplist. For example there could be an area of advice called vacations and a top list called romantic honeymoon vacations in Italy that servers as a short cut or gateway into the vacations topic with several questions from the vacations dialog already answered Where do you want to go Europe Where in Europe do you want to go Italy Are you traveling on a special occasion Yes What is the special occasion honeymoon . This may serve as an alternate interface for the user to seek advice through a traditional search interface without engaging in a question and answer dialog.

In embodiments various pages on the site may have self contained displays of information called widgets. For example the decision pages may have a widget that shows how other people who liked this question answered various questions videos pictures about the decision links to other web sites that have information about the decision personalized pros and cons of this decision based on how the user answered questions lists of other decisions that a similar lists of other decisions that would have been made had questions been answered differently lists of awards honors for this decision such as Consume Reports recommended and the like.

In embodiments the system may allow users to navigate through the universe of decisions e.g. cameras vacation destinations etc along dimensions that are not commonly available. For example instead of being shown a camera and only letting the user say show me more less expensive cameras the system may let the user say show me cameras that are more liked by young people show me a camera that is better for travel and less stylish and the like. Dimensions like style good for travel bad for young people and the like may be generated as a side effect by asking users questions and then learning what is a good decision given those answers.

In embodiments navigating along alternative dimensions may be used as a starting point for the user instead of the user selecting an area to seek advice in and then engaging in a dialog. The user may start interacting with the system by using a search interface or an external search engine to search for a specific decision result such as a product name or travel destination. The system would then show the user information about that specific decision result and allow the user to navigate to other decision results engage in a dialog to refine what the user is looking for or show the user information that the system has learned through machine learning expert advice or some combination about this specific decision result. For example a user may use a search interface to navigate to a web page showing information on a Canon SD1100 camera. The system may show other cameras that people looking for a Canon SD1100 also like allow the user to find similar cameras along non traditional feature dimensions such as a camera that is better for taking pictures of sporting events as well as show what the system knows about the Canon SD1100 such as great for travel not good for people learning photography . Available for under 200 Preferred by people who are consider themselves design conscious and the like.

In embodiments another possible interface may be to show users a list of decisions and display a simple explanation for why each decision is being made. For example when recommending cameras the system may show three cameras and say that one is cheaper one has longer zoom and the other is better for travel . This may help the user see alternatives that they may not have otherwise seen based on how they answered the questions leading up to the decision .

In embodiments users may be asked different types of questions such as questions about the item being recommended price color etc questions about themselves and the like. The system may differentiate users along dimensions such as psychographic dimensions demographic dimensions and the like. Properties of users that may be predictive may include the user s age sex marital status whether they live in rural urban areas frequencies of church attendance political affiliation aesthetic preferences sense of irony sense of humor socio economic background taste preference for neat or disorganized lifestyle degree to which they plan ahead of time and the like.

In embodiments it may be difficult to directly ask questions and instead the system may try to measure things that are correlated instead. For example instead of asking about income the system might ask where the user prefers to shop e.g. Wal Mart Target Saks etc . Aesthetics may be determined via showing pictures of art living rooms clothes and the like and asking which style the user prefers. In embodiments pictures may take the place of the question and the answers may be about how you react to the picture or the picture can take the place of answers to questions such as Which of the following best resembles the clothes you like to wear .

In embodiments the system may group questions by whether they are about the item being recommended or about the user. The system may explain what type of questions it is asking in order to help the user understand the value of otherwise surprising and potentially offensive questions being asked. The system may also display other types of messages to the user while asking questions such as telling the user how many questions remain taunting the user by saying the system can already guess what decision to make and the like.

In embodiments instant messenger IM systems may provide a natural interface to the question and answer dialog of the system. For example a user may invite our system to their buddy list and then initiate a dialog to get a decision over IM. The system may IM the first question to the user the user may then IM their answer back and the like until eventually the system IM ed the user a link to the decision or directly IM ed the name of the decision to the user. In embodiments other forms of communications may also be used such as cell phones SMS email and the like.

In embodiments the system such as in the form of an application may be embedded in third party web sites. For example the system could be put on a website that sells cameras and offer to recommend relevant cameras to the user. Alternatively after the user searched for cameras and had a list of potential cameras they were interested in the system could ask questions to help the user decide amongst the list of cameras. For example if all of the cameras that the user was considering were good for travel the system would not ask about how the user wanted to use the camera but the system might realize that asking whether interchangeable lenses were desired could be used to recommend one camera over another.

In embodiments the system may make decisions in a plurality of topic areas such as products e.g. cameras TVs GPS navigation home audio laptops bath beauty baby garden outdoor automobiles jewelry watches apparel shoes and the like travel e.g. where to go where to stay what region to visit what to do there and the like financial e.g. which mortgage whether to refinance which credit card whether something is deductible on taxes what type of IRA to save in asset allocation for investments and the like gifts for various holidays and occasions other date based decisions what to dress up for Halloween and the like personality e.g. about a user s personality about their relationships their career and the like recommending the right pet drinks and other aspects of night life books movies film music concerts TV shows video games where to eat what to order celebrity related such as which celebrity the user is most similar to recommending a gift what neighborhood to live in what to watch on television and the like.

In embodiments the system may be used to diagnose problems such as in the areas of technology IT e.g. computer software printers home networking wireless business networks performance issues and the like medical health automotive relationship or interpersonal problems home and building problems and the like.

In embodiments users of the system may be either anonymous or logged in users. A logged in user may be one that has created an account on the site. Logged in users may also have profile pages about them. Content on the profile page may include basic information about that user nickname picture etc decisions they have received and liked decisions the system predicts the user will like even though the user has not answered questions in that topic area lists of facts about the user that the user has given so that they do not need to be repeated each time the user uses the system for a decision e.g. the user s age or their aesthetic preferences can be given once and remembered across different times the user uses the system lists of tasks that the system thinks the user may be qualified and interested in doing via the wiki such as reviewing new user submitted content fixing spelling errors in user submitted content reviewing new content found by the widgets etc other users with similar answers to questions and the like.

In embodiments users may also have various titles ranks or levels which may affect what they can do on the system. For example some users may be given the title of moderator in a particular topic which would allow those users to edit certain aspects of those topics. The ranks and titles may be assigned manually or by through automatic means including being based on how many decisions they have given how many new questions or solutions they have contributed to the system how many tasks they have accomplished using the wiki how well they answer certain questions in the various topics and the like.

In embodiments non logged in users may not have the benefit of using the system with a large selection of aesthetic or taste based preferences already entered into their profiles. Based on learning or manual training from logged in users the system may select some aesthetic questions to ask in question dialogs when non logged in users seek advice in particular topic areas. For example based on logged in users answering taste questions about themselves and then giving feedback about which cars they like and don t like the system may learn that a question about whether the user enjoys gourmet dining is useful to ask non logged in users trying to decide between a Toyota and a Lexus. Using the attribute associations learned or manually specified by logged in users the system may then adjust whether it recommends the Toyota or the Lexus to the non logged in user.

In embodiments the system may learn from users submitting feedback on decisions. Some users may either intentionally or unintentionally give incorrect feedback. For example a vendor may try to game the system to make their product be highly recommended. Alternatively a user who does not know much about video games may recommend a video game that in reality is not a good video game. The system may try to filter out feedback from these users by a variety of means. The system may throttle the number of feedbacks that a given user can submit and have a higher throttle limit if the user is logged in or has a high rank title . The system may also throttle or weight feedback based on how well the user answers certain test questions during the question answer phase in order to test the user s knowledge of the subject and weigh feedback from knowledgeable users more than unknowledgeable users. The system may also require the user to pass a captcha Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart before their feedback is counted or they get a decision. The system may also look at the series of answers given by the user and weight the user s feedback based on that series of answers. For example if the user either always clicked the first answer or the user clicked in a very improbable way then the system may weight that user s feedback lower. Finally the system may change the weight of the user s feedback or decide to not show a decision based on the history of previous game plays. For example the 10th time a user tries to get a camera decision the system may weight their feedback less than on the 9th time.

In embodiments the system may include search engine optimization SEO the process of improving the system s website rankings within major search engines. This process may be broken down into several mostly automated steps such as discovering the keywords that users are searching for understanding the competition in the search engines to have the site s page come up when users search for these words understanding how search engines rank sites understanding what changes to the system s website need to be made in order to increase the site s ranking for common searches and the like.

In embodiments discovering keywords that users may be searching for may be found through different means such as using keyword suggestion tools such as what Google and Yahoo provide using data about historical searches licensed from third party data providers and crawling other websites to see what words they use and the like. Once these keywords are found the system may use the data in many ways such as bidding on those words via search engine marketing SEM developing content on the system s site about those keywords in hopes of getting search traffic in the future looking at how our competitors are using those same keywords and the like.

In embodiments the system may understand what other sites are doing and how they rank in the search engines by running keywords through the search engines and looking at who is advertising on each keyword and what the top natural search results are for each keyword. The sites discovered through this process may be crawled to discover more potential keywords. The system may also decide to develop new content or avoid a market based on this competitive information. If there are few highly ranked sites in a content area the system may develop content in that area.

In embodiments the system may understand that paid advertisements that bring users to the site are relatively cheap in one topic area of advice on the site and expensive in another. The system may therefore try to advertise for the low cost traffic help those users with their decision and then recommend that those users use the system in a topic area that is expensive to advertise and buy traffic in. For example the system may run ads for people who want to figure out what dog breed they should buy help those users decide what dog breed is right for them and then direct them to figure out where they should buy their pet medicines. The latter topic area being one that may be expensive for the system to source traffic in due to expensive ad rates while the former topic area may be relatively cheap as few existing businesses may be competing for customers who want advice on what type of dog to get.

In embodiments the system may understand how search engines rank their natural non sponsored search results by studying the relationship between sites that come up when a search is done and factors of those sites. Possible factors that may be correlated between sites that come up with high ranking may be factors such as the content of the site number and quality of other sites linking to the site the type of content on those other linking sites and the like. From the prior step the system may generate a list of site factors ranked by their ability to increase a sites ranking in the search engines and the like. The system may then use this ranked list to make changes to the site to increase the probability that the site as a whole or certain pages on the site will be highly ranked in the search engines.

Search engines may typically utilize a keyword index to find documents relevant to a user s query. In embodiments the present invention may utilize a decision index which may also map user input to relevant documents. The index may be built automatically experts may hand build the index the index may be learned through feedback from different types of users who implicitly or explicitly decide to train the system and the like. The results of the search utilizing the decision index may be displayed as a list of documents a single document and the like.

Referring to an embodiment for a list of topics in the system from which users may get decisions is presented including cameras cell phones coffee and espresso drinks favorite celebrity GPS devices grills. Halloween laptops personality toe rings TVs vacations video games watches and the like. In addition there may be an indicator as to the number of decisions learned from user ratings such as learned from 43 921 user ratings.

Referring to an embodiment of an example question that the system may ask a user is provided. In this example the user is asking for a decision related to the purchase of a camera and the question is How much are you willing to spend The user may now choose from the selection such as to select between less than 200 up to 300 up to 500 more than 500 I don t know and the like. In addition there may be an indication as to how many questions may be asked such as in In 10 questions or less get camera decisions preferred by people like you. In embodiments the user may also offer their own question their own answer their own decision and the like where the system may utilize this information in the current or future decision session. In embodiments the user may choose to skip the question where the user may now be provided an alternate decision based on a reduced amount of information available from the user the system may ask the user alternate questions to make up for the skipped question the question may have been a test question and will not affect the resulting decision and the like.

Referring to an embodiment of an example picture question that the system may ask a user . In this example the system may be asking a question whose answer may better enable the system to determine a personal characteristic of the user . For instance the question as illustrated asks Which of these causes you the most concern where the picture choices are indicative of certain topics such as pollution finances national defense health and the like. This question may be targeted to the current user or be inserted as an experimental question. In embodiments the user may be informed that the question is an experimental question such as shown in with the header that reads Finally please answer the experimental questions submitted by another user. 

Referring to an embodiment of an example of the type of information the system may show the user when making a particular decision is presented. For example the decision may be for a certain camera where information is provided about the camera such as a description who uses it the best cost for the camera how it compares to other cameras and the like. In embodiments other decisions may be provided such as with a relative ranking by a score by a percentage matching and the like. The user may also be queried for feedback such as being asked if the decision is a good decision. In addition the user may be provided with the opportunity to find out more about the decision such as more about the product best price finder websites to more advice and the like.

Referring to and the user may be provided with various top lists associated with a topic as described herein such as presented in association with a decision in association with a user s request to view top lists and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide users with a home page including user identification personal representation past decisions made future topics for consideration decision to make today and the like. provides an example of a user home page such as what the user sees when they are logged into the system account. Here there may be a display of recent decisions the system recommended lists of popular topics to get decisions in a search interface to find topics status updates about the user getting benefits for contributing to the system recent activity access to the user s profile and the like.

In embodiments users may be able to decide they want to contribute expertise to the system such as in a teach the system mode. shows an example of various links pages that may allow a user to contribute such as giving the system training about various decisions rating the quality of pictures and user contributed prose finding duplicate items and questions contributing new decision making topics contributing new questions to existing topics and the like.

In embodiments the user after choosing a topic for the system to make decisions for may be asked questions. provides an example of how a question may be presented to the user. As shown the presentation of the question to the user may provide different elements such as a topic heading a picture or illustration associated with the topic a question a set of answer choices and the like.

After answering questions the user may be provided an answer or decision associated with the user s original question. show an example of how a decision may be presented to the user and may include a primary decision information summarizing the decision alternate decisions variations on the decision and the like. In addition the user may be provided with an opportunity to provide feedback to the system such as whether the user agrees with the decision or not. The user may also be provided other suggested topics such as based on the current topic answers provide history of answers a user s profile a user s history of questions topics that other users found helpful and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a facility for providing an improved way to provide decisions to a user with a question across a broad category of topics including products personal health business political educational entertainment the environment and the like. For example the system may provide decisions on everything from whether a user should break up with their boyfriend to whether you should get a tattoo or not to whether you can deduct something on your taxes in addition to product decisions and the like. In embodiments the system may provide decisions on any interest a user may have.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a decision system that is flexible and is capable of changing and growing. This may be partly enabled by the system s use of a dialog of questions and answers to make a decision and then getting feedback from the user so the system can improve. In embodiments this approach may be significantly more powerful since the system may ask any question and therefore get much better information from the user about their wants. In addition users may be able to extend the system by entering their own questions and answers for the system to ask entering in new decisions for the system to make and the like. The system may then automatically try out newly entered information to see if it is useful or helpful and use this new information to determine if it is useful and possibly stop asking using the questions decisions that may not be as helpful to users. In embodiments this approach may provide for building a wisdom of the crowds based decision making expert system for potentially any topic.

In embodiments the present invention may also provide improved decision facility to the user by providing decisions by ranking across non traditional feature dimensions. For example instead of just ranking cameras by price or size the system may rank cameras based on how much they re liked by retired people how sexy they look and the like. The system may then help users navigate across these dimensions. For instance instead of users just being able to say I like this camera but want a cheaper one the system may let them do things like say I like this camera but want one better for learning photography or I like this vacation but want one with a more active social scene .

In embodiments the present invention may lend itself to a variety of different user interfaces such as a web interface instant messaging voice cell phone SMS instant messaging third party use e.g. a widget on a third party web service sold to a third party and the like. For example a voice interface may be well suited to the system since there may be a very limited vocabulary that the system must recognize such as just the possible answers to each question. In this way if the system can t understand a user response it may just move on to another question instead of annoying the user by asking them to repeat their answer over and over. In another example the present invention may be integrated into a third party site such as a search for a TV on an e commerce website where the present invention is a widget to help the user narrow down the results or using the present invention as a widget in association with a real estate website to build an MLS query for the user to find a house that is a good match for them. In embodiments the present invention may provide a user interface both in regard to a physical interface and in the way questions answers and decisions are presented that provides the user with a significantly improved way to obtain decisions on a great variety of topics.

In embodiments the present invention may be integrated into third party products in such as way as to improve the third party s user interface and user satisfaction. For example some website services provide predictions through past purchase history. In this case the present invention may be able to explore a user s mood or intent such as through asking explicit questions. In the case of search engines the present invention may be able to detect when the user is trying to make a decision and then start to ask them follow on questions. In the case of forum sites mailing lists news groups and the like the present invention may provide improved access to decisions and decisions that were made by people similar to the user. For example the present invention may be able to search through all the forum posts to find people who are in the same situation as the user and providing what decision the forum community recommended to them.

In embodiments the present invention may be able to extend ecommerce web application user interfaces. For instance a user may start a product search with a keyword search and then ask questions to narrow down the results to the best decision for the user. The present invention may be able to provide a Q A interface for picking a product once the user clicks into a category page. For example after clicking cameras on the website the user might see a first question. The present invention may be able to rank products along dimensions that are based on how users answer questions. For example cameras might be ranked from best to worst travel camera based on how people answer the question What do you want a camera for Answer Travel and then whether they give positive or negative feedback to a particular camera. This may allow the e commerce website to rank a list of camera keyword search results from best to worst travel cameras.

In embodiments the present invention may be able to provide an improved search engine capability such as detecting when a user is trying to make a decision and switching to a Q A interface based on the search results from a keyword search ask follow up questions to narrow down or re rank the results ask questions in order to build a keyword search query or to refine a search query learn feedback based on which links a user clicks after being asked questions and the like. In addition the present invention may implicitly learn about the user and alter rankings based on these implicit facts such as what time of day they re using the system where they are in the world what type of browser they re using weather where they are and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may be able to provide a way for information to be gathered and utilized by users. For instance Wikipedia is a way for users to contribute information such that the end user must to some extent self validate the accuracy of the information subsequently supplied to them. In a similar fashion the present invention may be able to host a web application that utilizes user contributed content. For instance instead of learning what the prices of cameras are the web application could have users input the prices of cameras and then allow other users to self validate these claims. In this way the scope of the contributed information may be allowed to grow organically as users interact with the system.

In embodiments some e commerce applications may provide for products and or services that are associated with personal preference and so may benefit from the present invention. For instance there are currently several movie rental web services where the user selects movies for delivery to their home through the mail. Decisions are also provided to the user based on what the user has selected in the past. However choosing a movie may involve personal interests at the time of rental that cannot be determined by past selections such as mood intent weather are they going to be alone or with someone their current personal relationships and the like. These types of interests may be explored with the present invention through questioning and as such may provide a much more personalized match to the user s interests at the time of rental.

In embodiments local search applications may be improved through the use of the present invention. For example if a user wanted a decision on where to eat dinner they might search for dinner in new york and find a website with suggestions targeted to the query. This interface however falls short when the user doesn t have a clear idea as to what keywords to include. For instance the user might not know the key options for food and might not think to search for ethiopian food new york. The present invention may have the advantage of being able to figure out what question it should ask in order to narrow down the possibilities. In embodiments the present invention may be able to aid in the building of a search query.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for an improved way to match up users and experts users and other knowledge based users and the like. For instance a service may be provided to collect users and experts on different topics. Users may then come to the web interface of the service and enter into a session of Q A where the best match is determined. As a result of the questions the system may provide a decision where the profile of the expert or other user is provided and where the user may be asked if they agree with the recommended individual. In embodiments the user may be provided a home page where previous matches and communications may be kept forwarded to friends experts rated and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a platform for a community based question and answer application. For instance users may post questions to the system and other users may be allowed to respond. In such a system a user may receive answers from a single user multiple users an automated system and the like where the user may be able to choose which answer they feel is correct. This answer may be kept private posted for others to view posted as the correct answer provided to the system and the like. In embodiments the system may use the questions and answers to further develop the system provide more accurate answers to users sort the answers provided to the user filter the answers provided to the user and the like. In addition users of the system may provide feedback to answers provided by other users contribute to filtering criteria for eliminating incorrect answers and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may be used as entertainment through machine learning capabilities as described herein. For instance a user may provide an input or think of an idea such as a topic a keyword a category a question a feeling and the like and the system may make a guess as to what it is through a series of questions and answers. For example the user may think of an object such as baseball and the system may utilize machine learning capabilities such as geometric systems to provide questions to the user. A typical question may relate to size such as is it bigger than a toaster These questions may then be answered by the user such as through multiple choice selection fill in the blank true false free response and the like. The system may then continue the question and answer sequence until it has a guess and provide this guess to the user. In embodiments this process may continue for a fixed number of questions a random number of questions a user specified number of questions a system determined number of questions a system specified number of questions and the like. In embodiments the system may provide the user with a user interface such as through the Internet via a website through a stand alone computational device through a mobile computational device through a phone service through a voice interface in association with an instant messaging service through text messaging and the like. In embodiments the system may be provided to a third party such as a widget to another website as an API to a third party application and the like. In embodiments the present invention may use non neural networks for entertainment applications such as playing games.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a system to assist in the discovery of new drugs where the system may provide an aid in the selection and combination of molecules in creating a new drug. For example the system may ask the user about information associated with chemical parameters such as solubility reactivity toxicity and the like and combine these with questions to probe the user s expertise in recognizing molecular structures. As the question and answer sequence progresses the system may provide the user with insights as to which molecular structures may be stable and synthesizable. In embodiments the process may continue until the user has an improved sense for what molecular combinations may make for a new drug until the choice of new exploratory routes are available for presentation to the user until an new potential drug is identified and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for an image finder application where the user may be assisted in identifying an image that fits some subjective criteria that is not necessarily explicitly known to the user. For example a user may be involved in the development of a brochure for a company where they have the text for the brochure but need to select an image to support the ideas and emotions that the text is trying to convey. The user may in this instance have a subjective idea as to what type of photograph may be required but not necessarily to the extent that they could specify a search with keywords. The user may instead first specify the source of the images such as from a file a database a website service from Google images from an advertiser image bank and the like. Then the user may be asked a series of questions or be presented with a series of images to choose from. The answers and or selections that the user chooses may then be utilized in refining the choices that are next presented to the user and from which further questions and or image selections may be provided. In embodiments this process may continue until the user finds an image to select as the final image. Additionally the system may take the user s final selection and select a group of other similar images for presentation to the user at which time the user may choose to continue the process of selection refinement.

In embodiments the present invention may be used in a baby naming application where the user may have only a vague sense of what names they might prefer. The user may be initially asked different types of questions intended to provide the system with information to aid in the learning of the user s preferences such as questions about family friends education heritage geographic location place of birth hobbies books read movies watched and the like. The system may then continue to learn through the presentation of questions associated with name preference in a plurality of ways such as rating name choosing from a list of names answering questions pertaining to name and the like. In embodiments this process may continue until the user finds a name to select as the final name.

In embodiments the present invention may provide results based on multiple dimensions such as a result based on a textual match from a user input based on the user s taste profile and the like. shows an example search interface showing search results for the user query fios . In this example the rankings are based on first finding decisions and decision results recommendations that are a good textual match for the user query and then second ranking the decision results by the knowledge the system has about the user s taste profile. In this example fios is a good textual match for the decision results Verizon FIOS as the recommendation to Which ISP should I use and What US satellite cable service provider should I get and both are this users 1 ranked result based on the user s taste preferences.

In embodiments the present invention may provide multiple question and answer results in response to a user s unstructured input. For example shows a case where the user s query is suv . The first result is for the topic What new car should I buy but with the question what type of car do you want already answered with suv . This may provide a bridge between unstructured search and the structured Q A data that the system stores. Further as shown in the example the user s top 3 results are displayed personalized based on their taste profiles. Effectively the user has done a keyword search and gotten results without explicitly answering any questions via the traditional Q A interface such as for the other questions provided as examples shown Which BMW should I buy What late model used car should I buy and What tires should I use on my car or truck .

In embodiments the present invention may ask the user to express their preferences when they have given answers to questions that either contradict each other are mutually exclusive or which each individually have a dramatic affect on the rankings of results for the user. For example the user may start the What new car should I buy topic and answered that they want a SUV that is under 18 000 and is more practical than extravagant. The system may want to get the user s preference as to what is more important that the vehicle be an SUV or under 18 000. shows an example question to the user asking for their preference.

In embodiments the system may learn a set of question importances that are per user per decision result per question s answer per decision result and the like. For example the system may learn that user A cares more about weight than price when it comes to buying small cameras but cares more about price than anything else when it comes to buying cars.

In embodiments users may extend the system by adding new decision results. Those new decision results may optionally include links to web pages to read more about the decision result. The system may automatically convert those links to affiliate links such that the system receives commissions from the site that the link points to. Further based on the link submitted by the user the system may recognize what kind of link it is and understand how to parse out information such as price for products such as from Amazon.com or parse out product codes so that vendor specific API calls can be made to look up product information based on the product codes.

In embodiments users may be clustered into groups using dimension reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition SVD eigenvector and other like based approaches. The system may display information about why a group of users were clustered together. One way to do this is to find the top X dimensions in the low dimension space that the cluster as a whole differs most on from the population average. The divergence of the cluster s distribution of answers from the general population s distribution in each dimension in the sub space may be used to rank dimensions in terms of how well they explain what is unique about each cluster.

In embodiments the dimensions in the sub space may not be easily described or interpreted due to their being composed of many different features such as how people answered questions or which decision results they like. One way to explain what each dimension means may be to find questions and answers that are most correlated with the different extremes of the dimension and label the dimension with these questions answers.

In embodiments one way to cluster users may be to pick an initial random grouping of users and iteratively move users between clusters to minimize how much users differ from each other in their own cluster. After some number of iterations the process may be stopped or the process may continue until a threshold amount of error has been reached.

In embodiments the present invention may facilitate matching by user similarity. Given a username email address numeric user id and the like provide a list of other users who are similar or dissimilar in some way. For example given a Facebook username provide a ranked list of other Facebook users who have similar tastes over all or in some specific way such as in electronics. In addition this list may be optionally restricted such as to other users being one degree away in the social graph from the first user e.g rank my friends on Facebook by their similarity to me so that I can ask the one most like me a question . In embodiments user similarity may be computed via asking a user questions about themselves looking at their social graph using context like their location IP address time and the like. The social graph may be used by mapping users in the social graph to known users in other data sets based on heuristics on username email address first name last name birthday address sex and other like information. Adjacent people may be searched in the social graph to bring more people into consideration even if they are more removed from the person you are trying to triangulate in on. For example combining a social graph from Facebook with users who have written reviews on Amazon to find users on Facebook who are most like me and then look at what laptops they tend to like on Amazon in order to give me a laptop recommendation. In another example reviews may be filtered on a site such as Yelp Tripadvisor Amazon and the like based on people similar to you. This information may then be used to help the user such as recommending users to friend on Facebook to follow on Twitter and the like. provide examples of similarity profiles as may be provided by the present invention.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a level of indirection between recommendations by instead recommending people who in turn like dislike things. The present invention may recommend things to buy based on what similar users bought on Amazon places to eat based on similar users on Yelp Zagat Foursquare and the like things to click on in Google search results based on what similar people clicked on and the like. For example consider the problem of recommending which users a new user to Twitter should follow. The present invention may look at all the users on Twitter and who follows them and match some of those followers to the data set of the present invention knowing things about each user based on the questions they have answered about themselves. This could also match the followers to other users such as Amazon users Yelp users and the like to learn other things about them. Based on this the present invention may make inferences about the followers of a particular user such at a Twitter user. Now a new user may be asked about themselves and find which existing user s followers this new user is most like. A recommendation may then be generated for the new Twitter user to follow the existing Twitter user whose followers are most like the new user.

In embodiments the present invention may facilitate real time personalization such as making recommendations that immediately reflect new information from a user immediately use their social graph new facts about them their context such as changing location etc. to re rank recommendations or otherwise improve results.

In embodiments the present invention may match based on context such as location time weather social graph and the like such as implicitly using location to show nearby places a user might like to eat drink sites they might like to see things to do etc. For example this process may then be used in a mobile application that has access to location data via GPS. Optionally the recommendation may be informed by other parts of the user s context such as the current weather e.g. don t recommend a place that people only like because of the patio if it s raining current time e.g. don t recommend nightclubs at 10 am calendar e.g. know when user is busy and where they have to be in the future social graph e.g. recommend places that the user s friends are at all else being equal and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a natural language question and answer interface such as to allow freeform or structured input from a user about a decision or recommendation they want help with. The input may be categorized either by asking the user having other users review the question using automated techniques like natural language processing i.e. is this question about electronics travel cars or some other topic and the like.

In embodiments the present invention may find similar users to the requesting user who has expertise in the category of the question. For example the user may want advice about hotels in L.A. from people who have similar taste in hotels AND know something about L.A. hotels such as either self described knowledge or demonstrated knowledge based on their actions . For example the present invention may then alert those similar users to the new question and requesting their help in solving it. Consideration may be given to how many prior questions alerts they have been sent how many they have already responded to how helpful their responses have been and the like. Similar users may be allowed to engage in a dialog with the requesting user to help inform the requesting user s decision or recommendation problem. The resulting dialog may be stored for others to use and encourage the similar users to index the dialog into a structured form to aid later recall by other requesting users.

The present invention may provide third party sites with the ability to learn about their users finding similar users and making recommendations such as independently of direct user interaction with the system. In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties such as third parties hosting their own web sites may use to learn about the tastes preferences likes dislikes and other attributes of a user where the user is not engaged in a dialog or interacting directly with the computing facility of the present invention. For example a user may go to a website such as Amazon.com and make an inquiry about a product. In this instance Amazon may have an API of the present invention that enables the creation or enhancement of a taste and preference profile of a user so as to better determine the user s tastes preferences and the like and so enable the third party to better target meaningful responses back to the user with regard to the user inquiry. In embodiments the third party may use the API to determine the tastes preferences and the like of the user without user interaction such as by determining their tastes and preferences through previous interactions with the user where these previous interactions may be from previous interactions while on the third party site such as Amazon in this example or from previous interactions with other websites hosting a similar API or through direct interaction with a facility of the present invention. In embodiments the API may be used by a plurality of users such that interactions with the users may be used to identify other similar users and so use the choices decisions selection recommendations and the like of these other similar users to aid in the selection of recommendations to the present user. In embodiments these other similar users may be associated with the third party hosting the API or from another host API site or from a facility of the present invention. In embodiments the use of an API of the present invention hosted by a third party site may provide a significant advantage to the third party site with regard to recommendations that are relevant to the tastes preferences likes dislikes attributes and the like of the user.

In embodiments tastes and preferences of a user may be determined or augmented though other users such as other similar users other users that are connected to the user in a social network other users that are associated through a personal or professional activity other users that are friends or family and the like. In embodiments this may be done without the need to ask questions of the user. For instance a user may have an existing taste and preference profile as established through the present invention and that profile may be improved by collecting or inferring information about other users in their social network family place of business and the like. In embodiments the user s profile may be improved through inferring additional tastes and preferences from other similar users or users shown to have some connection to the user such as through a social network. In embodiments the user s profile may be improved through choices made by other similar users such as in a product selection recommendation and the like. In embodiments the system may learn about a known user s taste profile though their rating things they like and don t like or through the use of natural language processing such as inferring a taste profile by analyzing how the user tags their user profile.

Referring to in embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a third party website to learn about a user through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to the third party website to determine preferences of the user as applied to a market of the third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the market of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and storing them as a user preference profile 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website associated with the market of the third party and 5 supplying a recommendation to the third party based on the user preference profile and the third party information to aid the third party in the answering of the received query . In embodiments the determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The third party information may consist of at least one of product information from product manufacturers product information from web merchants pricing information from other websites availability information from other websites pricing information from merchants availability information from merchants a review comments and ratings. The preference learning API may enable the collection of at least one of cost information product information personal information and topical information. Further user profile preferences may be additionally based on information inferred from a user s social network where the user may not receive additional dialog between the user and the computer facility.

Referring to the present invention may provide for the use of a taste and preference API to target responses returned to a user such as for targeting advertising show reviews from similar users recommend products or services show similar people on social networks to rank search results based on which results similar users clicked on most and the like. In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps target responses returned to a user through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of a user as related to a market of a third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the market of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and storing them as a user preference profile 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website and 5 using in the user preference learning API the third party information related to the market of the third party and the preferences of the user as stored in the user preference profile to provide a response back to the user that relates to the query from the user .

In embodiments the present invention may utilize a taste and preference API that third parties may use to target advertising to a user based on the user s preferences where the user is not engaged in a dialog or interacting directly with the computing facility of the present invention. For instance a user may have previously undergone a dialog of questions and answers with the system and through that dialog the system may have developed a taste and preference profile for the user. In embodiments the dialog may have been provided directly with a facility of the present invention or through a third party API provided by the present invention. Alternately the user may have never interacted with a facility of the present invention where the user s taste and preference profile may be created and updated through the user s interactions responses recommendations reviews and the like. In embodiments the system may learn about a known user s taste profile though their rating things they like and don t like or through the use of natural language processing such as inferring a taste profile by analyzing how the user tags their user profile. The taste and preference profile for the user may then be used to target advertising to the user such as advertising that is matched to the user s tastes and preferences. For example a third party taste and preference API may be associated with an outdoor store website such as L.L. Bean REI EMS and the like where the outdoor store is trying to improve their targeting of advertising to their customers. A customer may then visit the outdoor store website and make a query for a product such as for hiking boots. The taste and preference API may then enable a look up of the user s tastes and preference in order to establish a match for an advertisement placement to the user s browser. In this example the user s taste and preference profile may indicate that the user enjoys traveling to New England likes to camp has a family with children and the like. As a result the advertisement facility associated with the website may select an advertisement that utilizes the information in the user query in this instance hiking boots and information from their taste and preference profile. An advertisement in this case may be for lodging in the White Mountains which combines the user s hiking boot query with their preference for travel in New England. Further the lodging may be a family lodging because of the user likes to travel as a family and with attributes that mirror the user s preferences. In embodiments the third party taste and preference API may enable a third party to improve their targeting of advertisements to users such that they are able to increase revenue made on a given advertisement placement from an advertisement sponsor. In embodiments the user taste and preference profile may be developed in real time as focused on their immediate query. Tastes and preferences may be gleaned so as to better target advertisements to the user such as during subsequent refinement of product search at the point of purchase and the like.

In embodiments advertising may be targeted to a user or a group of individuals associated with the user based on taste and preferences inferred though the user s social network. For instance a taste and preference API used by a third party may be used to establish taste and preferences for a group node cluster and the like such as in a user s social network. In embodiments the tastes and preferences inferred from the social network may utilize taste and preference profiles previously formed such as though third part sites or through a facility directly associated with the present invention. These taste and preferences may then be used to better target advertisements to the user or to members of the user s social network. In an example a third party may want to target advertisement to a user where the user has an established taste and preference profile stored in a facility of the present invention. The third party may then use information in the user s profile to target advertisements. Alternately the third party may additionally use information inferred from a social network that the user is part of such as information pertaining to the topics of the social network common interests of users associated with the user in the social network and the like. For instance the user may have a taste and preference profile that indicates they are middle aged politically conservative rural and the like and is associated with users in a social network that have hunting as a dominate interest. In this instance the third party may target advertisements for hunting equipment hunting trips and the like where the advertisement has been selected based on the user s existing taste and preference profile plus inferences from the user s social network. In embodiments this may be done without the need to engage the user in a dialog as described herein but rather indirectly through the user s interactions such as on the third party website through third party supplied information on other websites where the present invention has a third party API and the like. In embodiments the third party may also utilize the taste and preferences from the user to target advertisements to other members of the user s social network.

In embodiments advertising to a user may be targeted based on the product choices recommendations and the like of users with similar tastes and preferences. For example a first user may have similar tastes and preferences to a second user where the first user has an existing taste and preference profile and has made certain product choices recommendations and the like. Advertisements may then be targeted to the second user based on the decisions of the first user. For example a first user may have a profile that indicates they are older retired lives in California enjoys travel and the like where they have previously made a product choice for luggage. A second user may then be provided a recommendation for similar luggage based on the similarity of the tastes and preferences of two users. In embodiments this may be executed without the need to engage either of the users in a dialog.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps target advertising to a user through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of the user as applied to a market of a third party wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 receiving third party information related to the market of the third party 3 collecting the preferences of the user and store them as a user preference profile 4 receiving a query from the user at the third party website associated with the market of the third party and 5 providing an advertisement to the user wherein the advertisement is based on the ascertained preferences of the user. In embodiments the determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The advertisement may be provided by the computer facility. The advertisement may be provided through the third party and enabled through preferences provided to the third party from the computer facility. The API may enable the collection of at least one of cost information product information personal information and topical information. The decision may be also based on information inferred from a user s social network. An advertisement may be delivered to other users associated with the user such as through a social network.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to provide users with reviews from similar users where the user and similar users may not have engaged in a dialog or interacting directly with the computing facility of the present invention. For instance the taste and preference API may enable the present invention to collect taste and preference information for the user provide the third party with taste and preference information for the user from a previously established taste and preference profile provide the third party with taste and preference information for the user based on near term actions of the user and the like. In embodiments the user may have never interacted with a facility of the present invention where a user s taste and preference profile may be created and updated through the user s interactions responses recommendations reviews and the like. In embodiments the system may learn about a known user s taste profile though their rating things they like and don t like or through the use of natural language processing such as inferring a taste profile by analyzing how the user tags their user profile. In this case similar users may have a previously established taste and preference profile and as such may have a taste and preference profile that may be matched to the user. In addition these similar users may have reviews associated with their profile. The system may now match the user to a similar user and then provide the user with the associated review. For instance a user may have an existing taste and preference profile with the system such as directly with the computer facility or though at least one third party API and may want to know what other similar users thought of some product service person event and the like. The system may then search the taste and preference profiles for similar users on the subject the present user has interest in. In this way the system may now be able to provide reviews and such to the present user from similar users and thus helping the present user determine what they may want to do based on their tastes and preferences. For example a user may go to a product website that utilizes the taste and preference API of the present invention and is interested in reviews for digital cameras. The third party may now find similar users and then search for digital camera reviews by those similar users and provide the reviews to the current user. In embodiments the reviews may be resident at a third party facility at another third party facility at a facility of the present invention and the like. In embodiments the ability to show reviews of similar users may allow the user to access more relevant reviews in a more time efficient manner and the third party user of the API may be able to provide more targeted and relevant support to their users.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to provide users with reviews from similar users where the users are determined to be similar without the similar users participating in a dialog through the present invention. For instance the similar user may be identified as being similar through a social network friend family work and the like. In an example a user may be associated with a second user though a social network and through this association determined to be similar such as though age interests and the like. The similar user may then provide a review such as for a product an activity and the like. This review may then be provided to the user as relevant though the similarity to the other user. In embodiments similar users may be determined through similar recommendations on other topics such as in combination with other factors where the other factors may be a social association.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a user find reviews of similar users through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 providing a user preference learning API to a third party website to determine preferences of the user wherein the preference learning API is executing as an extension of the computer facility 2 collecting preferences of a plurality of users wherein the plurality of users includes the user 3 storing the preferences of the user in a taste and preference database which contains a plurality of taste and preference profiles 4 receiving a request from the user through a third party taste and preference learning API for a topical review from a user who has similar taste and preferences 5 matching the preferences of the user to at least one other user s preference in the taste and preference database 6 searching for a review related to the request for the topical review from amongst the matched other users and 7 providing the review to the user. In embodiments the determining preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The review may be found within the computer facility a facility of the third party and the like. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The preference learning API may enable the collection of cost information product information personal information topical information and the like. The review may be provided by a similar user that has no taste and preference profile where the user may be similar as determined though a social association where the social association may be a social network.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to recommend products services and the like. For instance a user may come to a third party website in search of a recommendation for a product and the third party may then utilize the taste and preference API to better understand what the user typically prefers and from that preference suggest a product. In an example the user may come to an audio store website looking for a recommendation for an audio system for playing music from their iPhone. The third party may then utilize existing taste and preferences for the user through the API. In this example the tastes and preferences of the user may indicate that they are a collage student and often on the run in their social life. From this information the third party may now make recommendations such as recommendations for audio systems that are portable small powerful and the like. Alternately the third party may use the taste and preference API to determine their taste and preferences at the time of the user inquiry such as targeted to the inquiry content of the third party for the user in general and the like. The third party may use this new taste and preference information alone or in combination with previous tastes and preference profiles through the present invention to make the recommendations. The taste and preferences as established through the third party may now be stored in a facility of the present invention such as to be used again or in combination with new taste and preference profiles generated through other third party APIs or directly through a facility of the present invention. In embodiments the ability to use the taste and preference API may improve the recommendations for products services and the like that are made through third party sites.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third parties may use to recommend products services and the like to a user based on the actions of similar users. For instance two users may have previously established taste and preference profiles with the present invention where one of the users has selected a product service or the like and where third party may now provide a recommendation to the other user based on their similarity such as determined through their profiles. In an example two users may have been determined to be similar through their taste and preference profiles such as by their age location political views social activities and the like. The first user may then select a product such as a car. In the event that the second similar user should indicate an interest in a car such as through searching advertisement selection explicit question to the present invention and the like the present invention may provide the car selection to the second user as a potential fit because of their similarities. In embodiments this may be done without a dialog provided to one or both users.

The preferences may be derived from an action of a second similar user where the similarity may be determined through a taste and preference profile for the user and second similar user. The action of a second similar user may be a selection of at least one of product and service.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third party social network sites may use to show a user people that are similar to them on the social network. These similar people may be shown as a list as photos by region by age by gender and the like. For instance the user may come to a social network site and ask to see or be connected to people who are similar to them. The social network site may then utilize the taste and preference API to provide the user with a dialog to determine their tastes and preferences such as in general to social situations to social networking to activities to music to personality and the like. Alternately the user may already have a taste and preferences profile as determined directly by a facility of the present invention through another third party API though the social network site and the like. The social network may then use this information to match the user to other people on the social network such as through taste and preference profiles of the other people as previously determined through information available about the other people as available through the social network and the like. For example the user s taste and preference may indicate that they are young and enjoy going to clubs in the NYC. The social networking site may now be able to match the user to similar people on the social network such as by list photograph by category by region of the city and the like. In embodiments the taste and preference API with a social network may provide an enhanced matching experience to the user who is trying to find other similar people to be social with.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps a user find other similar users on a social networking site through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 receiving an initial request from a user through a third party social networking site API wherein the initial request is to find other similar users to them on the social network 2 ascertaining preferences of the user through the social networking site API 3 matching the user preferences to other users on the social network with users with similar preferences and 4 providing a matching result to the user that includes the other users that match user s preference. In embodiments the ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The matching result may be presented to the user as a list of the similar users. The matching result may be presented to the user as a profile of the similar users. The matching result may be presented to the user as links to the similar users within the social network. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility.

In embodiments the present invention may provide a taste and preference API that third party searching facilities may use to rank search results based on which results similar users selected the most. For instance the searching facility may offer users the opportunity to improve the relevancy of how the search results are listed through a tastes and preference profile as provided through the taste and preference API of the present invention. A taste and preference profile database or the like may then be accumulated and maintained from which the searching facility may rank search results for the user to previously selected results by other similar users. In an example a user may have a taste and preference profile that shows a retired male who likes to sail and is a bit adventurous. When the user searches for Caribbean vacation destinations the searching facility may rank the search results with these taste and preference attributes listed first such as for sailboat rental packages in the islands hiking in the islands off beat destinations and the like. In embodiments the use of a taste and preference API provided to a searching facility may improve the relevancy of ranked search results to the user.

Referring to the present invention may utilize social graphs to infer the taste and preferences for an unknown user by finding paths through an Internet based social interactive construct to people with known taste preferences. In this way the present invention may provide a way to get data for a user that the system has never heard of before. In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps determine an unknown user s preferences through the use of internet based social interactive graphical representations on a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 ascertaining preferences of a plurality of users who are part of an internet based social interactive construct wherein the plurality of users become a plurality of known users 2 determining the internet based social interactive graphical representation for the plurality of known users and 3 inferring the preferences of an unknown user present in the internet based social interactive graphical representation of the plurality of known users based on the interrelationships between the unknown user and the plurality of known users within the graphical representation . In embodiments the Internet based social interactive graphical representation may be a social network a social graph a social diagram and the like. The unknown user may be three degrees five degrees and the like away from the closest known user in the internet based social interactive graphical representation. The inferred preferences of the unknown user may make the unknown user a new known user and the new known user may be used to contribute to the inferring of the preferences of a second unknown user. The preferences may include personal information topical information and the like related to interactions of the user where the interactions may be through the internet based social interactive graphical representation. The interactions may be through an API provided to a third party website. The inferring may be provided in conjunction with other known users that are related to the user in the user s internet based social interactive construct. The ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The inferred preferences may be used to target advertising to the unknown user to share reviews with the unknown user. The inferred preferences may be used to recommend products services and the like to the unknown user. The inferred preferences may be used to aid in ranking search results for the unknown user. Known users that are in close proximity to the unknown user may carry more weight in an inferring algorithm. The inferred preferences may be refined by information from other sources where the other sources may include third party sources recommendations made by the plurality of known users search queries by the plurality of known users search result selections one of the plurality of known users personal tastes as determined through web interactions by at least one of the plurality of known users and the like. The other sources may include a third party preference learning API.

In embodiments the present invention may utilize social network graphs diagrams graphical representations and the like to infer the taste and preferences for an unknown user by finding paths through a social network to people with known taste or visa versa. Social diagrams are generally speaking the mapping of a plurality of users and how they are related. By using the social diagram a taste and preference of a known and unknown user may be determined from their interrelation within the diagram. For instance a user with a known taste and preference profile may be directly associated with a plurality other users such as represented in a social diagram. To a first approximation it may be assumed that these plurality of other users are similar to the user and so have similar taste and preferences. These other users may then be provided refined services that take advantage of knowing a users taste and preference such as described herein. For example provided with a user with a known taste and preference profile indicating they are a rock climber it may be assumed that users within a first link of the user s social diagram are also rock climbers. In reality this may prove to be too general an assumption. However it may be a good assumption that the user does have associations with other rock climbers and so the system may go out through the social diagram searching for other known users that enjoy rock climbing. In this example it may be found there is another known user such as three links away that also enjoys rock climbing and this user is found in a cluster that connects to the first user. From this it may be a good assumption that this cluster is a group of rock climbers and rock climbers may all share a set of similar tastes and preferences with each other. In embodiments tastes and preferences may be inferred from associations within a social network diagram and as such may be provided benefits from the present invention as described herein.

In embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers helps determine an unknown user s tastes and preference through the use of social network graphical representations on a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 ascertaining preferences of the user wherein the user becomes a known user 2 determine the social network graphical representation for the known user 3 determine the presence to other known users within the known user s social network graphical representation and 4 infer the preferences of an unknown user present in the known user s social network graphical representation based on the interrelationships between the unknown user and the known user and other known users within the network graphical representation. In embodiments the ascertaining of preferences may be through the use of natural language processing. The social network graphical representation may be a social graph a social diagram and the like. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility.

In embodiments the present invention may combine the tastes and preferences of a user as determined through two or more third party API to improve recommendations provided through the two or more third party API. For instance there may be taste and preference profiles being established through more than a single third party API and by combining these different tastes and preference profiles by the present invention a combined taste and preference profile may be generated. Further as additional taste and preference profiles are created through third party API they may be used to continuously update the combined taste and preference profile for a user. The third parties may then utilize the combined taste and preference profile to improve their recommendations. This may especially be the case when different third parties focus taste and preference profiling on different areas such as products personal relationships services celebrities and the like. It can be appreciated that combining a number of more specific profiles into a combined profile may provide a richer taste and preference profile then could be generated through any one of the more specific profiles. In addition a user may change their tastes and preferences over time and so combining more recent user profile interactions on one third party API may benefit another third party that the user has not interacted with in recent time but where the other third party wants to keep their user profiles up to date.

Referring to in embodiments the present invention may provide for a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers provides improved taste and preference profiling through the use of a computer facility by performing the steps of 1 creating a first taste and preference profile of a user through the user s interactions with a first third party website through a first preference learning third party API 2 collecting additional user interaction information through a second third party website through a second third party API and 3 combining the additional user interaction information with the taste and preference profile to improve the taste and preference profile . In embodiments creating a first taste and preference profile may be through the ascertaining of user preferences through the use of natural language processing. The computing facility may be a machine learning facility. The API may enable the collection of at least one of cost information product information personal information and topical information.
