The embodiments herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government without the payment of royalties thereon.

Magnetic storage has a limited storage lifetime bit density and volatility. The magnetic medium used in traditional disk storage degrades within a decade. The information is stored in small magnetic bit regions through magnetizing each region in a particular direction. Over time the magnetization of the bit regions is corrupted by external electromagnetic forces or through exposure to the Earth s magnetic field or by thermal upsets. Thermal upsets are statistical processes that occur when the magnetization of a bit is thermally activated to overcome the anisotropy barrier. Magnetic tape is used extensively for archiving but the tape deteriorates over time. With magnetic tape there is an additional cost associated with controlling the temperature and humidity in order to slow down the deterioration of the tape. Another disadvantage of magnetic tape is that the access time for getting information from a particular part of the tape is long.

As electronic recording evolves and more information is digitized there exists not just a critical necessity for storage volume but also increased storage permanency. A need exists for high density stable non volatile memory with a longer storage life and less potential to be corrupted by external influences.

The present invention is directed to inter alia storage of information using regions with different permeability and the use of laser heating in conjunction with recording to thermally change the permeability of for example Metglas or multilayers of copper and permalloy. In the latter case it does this by having the copper diffuse into the permalloy and destroying the magnetism of the nickel.

The present invention utilizes the laser heating device for heat assisted magnetic recording to heat the substrate to change the magnetic permeability of the bit regions.

The present invention is also directed to a method of reading information from a magnetic medium based upon the magnetic permeability of the bit regions some having low permeability and some having high permeability. The laser heating device s associated with heat assisted magnetic recording operates to heat the substrate to change the magnetic permeability of the bit regions.

A preferred methodology for reading media in a non erasable or nonvolatile memory technology is based on bits of high and low magnetic permeability. Since the permeability is an intrinsic property this technology can potentially encode information at higher densities and with longer retention times than present magnetic storage based on spin domains. To illustrate the preferred embodiment technique 10 micron wide magnetic tunnel junctions MTJs are used to read approximate 10 micron wide lines with approximate 50 micron separation of a soft magnetic material permalloy deposited on low permeability glass as depicted in . The dimensions may be modified without departing from the scope of the present invention. A magnetic probe field is unaffected by the glass but is shunted away from the MTJs by the higher permeability permalloy lines. The difference in field sensed by the MTJs has a signal to noise ratio of 45 dB that persists and is not altered after the lines are exposed to fields of 6400 Oe. Reading information density with higher density can be accomplished by decreasing the size of the magnetic tunnel junctions and the separation between the bits and the MTJ.

Current magnetic memory technology that manipulates an extrinsic property of magnetic media e.g. the direction of magnetization as shown in to encode information has two major disadvantages for data storage. First since the information is written by applying a magnetic field to switch the spin direction the information can also be erased by exposure to an inadvertent magnetic field. Secondly the density and lifetime of the bits are restricted by the need to preserve thermal stability of the magnetic domains. Thermal stability of the domains is constrained by the super paramagnetic limit as described in greater detail in Y. Zhimin et al. in Magnetic Recording Conference 2009. APMRC 09. Asia Pacific. 2009 and R. F. L. Evans Applied Physics Letters 2012. 100 10 p. 102402 3. For example to reliably store information at room temperature for 7 years domain sizes above 5 50 nm are required to satisfy the N el Arrhenius relation KV kT 50 where Via the volume of the bit Kis the crystalline anisotropy kis the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. Alternative methods of information storage do not presently possess the density of magnetic memory and generally do not retain information indefinitely. Thus each year billions of dollars worldwide must be spent duplicating huge amounts of data to prevent corruption by deteriorating of magnetic tapes thermal upsets or accidental exposure to magnetic fields. To improve the ability to store information a preferred embodiment technology stores information by using an intrinsic property of soft ferromagnetic materials the magnetic permeability. The presence of high low permeability material modifies does not affect an external probe magnetic field. Any magnetic field modification is detected by a reader in close proximity to the media which consists of regions of different permeability as described in greater detail in U.S. Published Application No. 2008 0102320 by A. S. Edelstein and G. A. Fischer entitled Non Erasable Magnetic Identification Media hereby incorporated by reference. The media is non erasable as the magnetization of a soft ferromagnet returns to its original demagnetized state when the probe magnetic field is removed. Since the magnetic permeability is an intrinsic property dependent on the atomic arrangement of the media it is insensitive to external influences e.g. electromagnetic radiation and temperature and should maintain an indefinitely long retention time under typical environmental conditions. Furthermore there is no theoretical limit on the density that is equivalent to the restriction of the super paramagnetic limit. The limitation instead is the practical requirement of finding an economical method for reading and writing the information.

The changes in field were determined by the tunneling magnetoresistance TMR in the MTJs at a constant current of 1 mA and a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. There are 10 serially connected 40 10 micron MTJ ellipses in the reader. The magnetic sense direction of these MTJs is in the plane of the glass and perpendicular to their major axis which is in the same direction as the MTJ chain. MTJ stacks were deposited onto a thermally oxidized silicon substrate in a magnetron sputtering system with a base pressure below 1 microtorr. Each magnetic tunnel junction MTJ reader shown in may comprise nm thick layers of Ta 5 Ru 20 IrMn 5 CoFe 4 Ru 0.8 CoFeB 3.5 MgO 2 CoFeB 1.8 NiFeCuMo 50 Cu 10 . The two layers immediately above the MgO insulator comprise the free layer and electrode . There are three layers not shown below fixed layer that constitute the synthetic antiferromagnetic SAF reference layer that is used to pin the direction of the magnetization in the fixed layer. See in this regard S. H. Liou et al. Magnetics IEEE Transactions on 2011. 47 10 p. 3740 3743 hereby incorporated by reference.

As seen in the reader MTJ chain for example has a maximum tunneling magnetoresistance TMR of 22 and a maximum sensitivity of 0.48 Oe in a field of 22 Oe. The reason that the maximum sensitivity is shifted from zero field has been attributed to roughness of the films and edge effects on each MTJ giving rise to stray fields from the reference layer as described further in S. Ikeda J et al. Electron Devices IEEE Transactions on 2007. 54 5 p. 991 1002. The permanent magnet provides a probe field of 32 Oe in the sense direction of each MTJ in the chain which results in a tunneling magnetoresistance TMR change of 11 and sensitivity of 0.32 Oe with no media present.

Referring again to shown in block diagram form is an illustration of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention using a spin torque oscillator and a spectrum analyzer to read magnetic media. As an alternative the spin transfer oscillator can be a spin valve in which the oxide in the magnetic tunnel junctions is replace by a non magnetic conductor. As shown in a reader comprises a magnetic field source a constant current source spectrum analyzer spin torque oscillator STO and magnetic media . The constant current source spectrum analyzer and STO are electrically connected in parallel. Permeable material changes the effective field at the position of the sensor which then changes the precession frequency of the STO. The precession frequency is measured as the frequency of the microwave voltage by the spectrum analyzer.

According to Wikipedia the spin transfer torque is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a magnetic tunnel junction or spin valve can be modified using a spin polarized current. Charge carriers such as electrons have a property known as spin which is a unique quantity of angular momentum intrinsic to the carrier. An electrical current is generally unpolarized consisting of 50 spin up and 50 spin down electrons a spin polarized current is one with more electrons of either spin. By passing a current through a thick magnetic layer one can produce a spin polarized current. If a spin polarized current is directed into a magnetic layer angular momentum can be transferred to the layer changing its orientation. This can be used to excite oscillations or even flip the orientation of the magnet. The effects are only seen in nanometer scale devices because of the need to have a high spin polarized current density. Spin transfer torque is illustrated in . Further according to Wikipedia spin transfer torque can be used to flip the active elements in the conventional magnetic random access memory. Spin transfer torque random access memory or STT RAM has the advantages of lower power consumption and better scalability over conventional magnetoresistive random access memory MRAM which uses magnetic fields to flip the active elements. Spin transfer torque technology has the potential to make possible MRAM devices combining low current requirements and reduced cost.

Unlike conventional memory construction the preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes the property of magnetic permeability to distinguish binary bits. The bits are read with a spin transfer oscillator that uses spin transfer torque to balance the effect of damping or read with some other magnetic sensor such as a magnetic tunnel junction.

The STO in is positioned to hover proximate the magnetic media . The media is comprised of first portions or bit regions having a stable nonvolatile state namely its magnetic permeability in a material such as Permalloy or Metglas. Metglas for example may be written by laser heating such that cooling rates determine whether a bit region has a high rapidly cooled amorphous state or low permeability less rapidly cooled crystalline state . The laser produces two distinct permeability regions on the Metglas that represent 1 s and 0 s. The resultant bit data may be permanent provided the Metglas is not exposed to high heat i.e. in excess of 400 C. . The bit regions may be radially aligned or arranged as a grid for accurately locating and reading the individual regions of the media . is a schematic illustration of a grid or array of cantilever heating elements. When the tips of the cantilevers are hot they can be utilized to write bits into a medium such as Metglas. Instead of the tips on the cantilevers lasers may be focused in an array similar to the array of cantilevers. In the spin transfer oscillator STO also known as a spin transfer torque microwave oscillator can contain either a spin valve or a magnetic tunnel junction. If it contains a magnetic tunnel junction it is comprised of a top electrode a magnetic free layer a non magnetic layer a magnetic pinned fixed layer and a lower electrode . Often an artificial antiferromagnet not shown is used to pin the magnetization of the fixed layer. A current is passed from the current source through the STO electrodes and such that spin polarized current passes through the insulator . The magnetic moment of the free layer is in the plane parallel to the non magnetic layer . Some embodiments may be comprised of a non magnetic insulator material such as Magnesium Oxide MgO or Aluminum Oxide AlO . In the combination of the fixed layer insulator and free layer known as a magnetic tunnel junction the non magnetic layer or insulator layer acts as a spacer to magnetically decouple the free layer and the pinned layer . The structure of the STO thus leaves the magnetic torque of the free layer to rotate in response to external magnetic fields or the torque provided by a spin polarized current.

According to Wikipedia the tunnel magnetoresistance TMR is a magnetoresistive effect that occurs in a magnetic tunnel junction MTJ which is a component consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator. If the insulating layer is thin enough typically a few nanometers electrons can tunnel from one ferromagnet into the other. Generally thin film technology or film deposition forms the magnetic tunnel junction which is accomplished by magnetron sputter deposition molecular beam epitaxy pulsed laser deposition or electron beam physical vapor deposition. The direction of the two magnetizations of the ferromagnetic films can be switched individually by an external magnetic field. If the magnetizations are in a parallel orientation it is more likely that electrons will tunnel through the insulating film than if they are in the oppositional antiparallel orientation. The magnetic field that determines the orientations of the two layers can be altered by the at least one second portions of high permeability.

Consequently such a junction can be switched between two states of electrical resistance one with low and one with higher resistance which in effect measures whether the sensor is in close proximity to either a region of low permeability or high permeability.

In an STO electrons driven from the pinned layer causes electrons to orient with the field of the pinned layer then electrons interact with the free layer to cause the magnetization of the free layer to tend to align parallel with the magnetization of the pinned layer i.e. torque is transferred to the free layer . If the current direction is reversed the magnetization of the free layer tends to align antiparallel with the magnetization of the fixed layer . This torque transfer can prevent the magnetization of the free layer from relaxing and aligning parallel with the magnetic field. This causes the magnetization of the free layer to precess around the direction of the magnetic field and radiate microwave energy at the Larmor frequency that is proportional to the vector cross product right arrow over M right arrow over H where right arrow over M is the magnetization of the free layer and right arrow over H is the effective field acting on the magnetization of the free layer.

The current density driving the STO must be very high e.g. 10amps cm and be spin polarized. The motion of the free layer is governed by the Landau Lifshitze Gilbert LLG equation that includes the spin transfer torque term 

In equation 1 right arrow over M is the magnetic moment. right arrow over H is the effective magnetic field whether from the pinned layer or from an external source such as the magnetic media or probe field and includes the anisotropy field magnetostatic field and exchange field. is the gyromagnetic ratio 

x is the direction of current flow and is a constant which determines the relaxation rate. The quantity bis given by 2 where P is the spin polarization of the current is the Bohr magnetron jis the electric current density and Mis the saturation magnetization value of M.

The first term on the right hand side of the equation i.e. right arrow over M right arrow over H gives rise to the precession and the second term

The high permeability regions change the effective magnetic field right arrow over H . This in turn changes the frequency of the STO microwaves such that there is a measurable change in the frequency detected by the spectrum analyzer . The change is due to the amount of permeability for a specific bit area region on the media . The permeability of the media modifies the magnetic field right arrow over H from equation 1 in that magnetic field lines are attracted into the regions of the media with high permeability. Depending of the geometry i.e. the position of the high permeability regions in the media relative the STO this can either increase or. decrease the first term in Eq. 1. This will change the precession frequency. Since the STO has a high quality factor Q small changes in the microwave radiation are easily detectable as shifts in this microwave precession frequency. The voltage across the STO may be directly measured with the spectrum analyzer such that the change in the precession frequency is detected or indirectly the amplitude and the width of the resonance frequency change may be measured. Other embodiments may include an antenna to indirectly capture and couple the signal to the spectrum analyzer .

The magnetically permeable media will modify the RF signal from the STO in two ways. Firstly the permeability will modify the magnetic field at the position of the STO by modifying magnetic flux. Modifying the field will shift the precession frequency and hence also shift the frequency of the RF signal. Secondly the media will absorb microwave energy because of resistive losses. Since energy is absorbed into the media this will affect the spin oscillation in the STO free layer and lower the Q.

As the reader operates based on the magnetic permeability of the media the memory is non volatile as permeability is an intrinsic property. Lifetime integrity is also extended almost indefinitely as the media no longer needs to have a minimum energy for maintaining the magnetization direction that determines the bit value of the individual bit regions. Furthermore since the reader is not reliant on the magnetization direction of the regions the media is not limited by the super paramagnetic limit and may have greater bit density. Thus in some exemplary embodiments the reader may read bits that are 20 20 nm or 400 nmwith a bit density of 2.5 10 cm. The bit values detected by the spectrum analyzer may then be output to a computer for additional processing of the information.

The addition of the permanent magnets and allows for improved freedom to tailor the STO for particular media by modifying the frequency of the microwave radiation from the STO . The frequency modification may also allow using the maximum sensitivity of instruments such as the spectrum analyzer . depicts the exemplary embodiment including placing permanent magnets and of opposite polarity on either side of the STO and allowing the magnetic field to change the microwave frequency emitted by the STO and measured by the spectrum analyzer . Further embodiments may use one permanent magnet or multiple magnets or electromagnets to create an external magnetic field and may be proximately located to the STO as necessary to alter the microwave radiation from the STO .

The frequency counter digitizes the resulting IF signal for the threshold comparator . The comparator compares the outputted f output with some accepted value for example the predefined accept value may be determined based upon whether the shift frequency is greater than one half the expected f. The comparator applies predetermined known criteria for anticipated frequency shift values for a high or low permeability bit. The results of the high or low bits i.e. 1 or 0 are then output for processing by a computer comprising a CPU memory A D converters D A converters and digital signal processing ultimately leading to a user interface. Further embodiments may include the measured change in the frequency response as a change in quality factor gain or impedance matching.

The criterion includes a threshold for a 1 bit value at step which if returned true flags the bit location as a 1 . The method then determines if there are more bits to be read at step which if true proceeds back to align the STO with the next bit in the media or else the method ends . However if at step it is determined the 1 bit value threshold is not met the method determines whether the threshold for the bit value is a 0 at step . Should the threshold for bit 0 be met the bit location is accordingly flagged as a 0 and the method continues to determine if more bits are to be read at step . However if step determines the threshold for the 0 bit value is not met the method ends as an error or inconclusive reading. One of ordinary skill in the art would know of a variety of methods for dealing with this situation. For example the cycle could be repeated and if the threshold still is not met a determination of the value of the bit might be deduced from the context of information about neighboring bits. An alternative would be planned redundancy in crucial places where bits are essentially duplicated. Error correcting methods could also be used. In an exemplary embodiment wherein the frequency response is measured the measured frequency shift is compared with predetermined frequency criterion for bit values. As an example a 1 is where f f 2 and 0 is f 0 where fis the preset expected value for the high penneability bit.

Other further embodiments may include rewritable media such as the ferromagnetic class of alloys known as Metglas. Metglas is a material that has a high magnetic permeability of approximately 10 000 N Ain the amorphous state and a low permeability of approximately 5 10 N Awhen it is crystalline. By controlling the cooling rate from above 800 C. that results from heating by for example using an e beam or evanescent wave it is possible to rewrite the media by making the material either crystalline or amorphous. The advantage of using an evanescent wave is that one can achieve higher density because the resolution is not limited by the wave length of the light. In optics using geometric constraints electromagnetic waves are transmitted from one medium to another producing an evanescent exponentially decaying electromagnetic field.

Other embodiments may include multiple levels that are based on corresponding levels of permeability and saturation. The multiple levels of permeability may thus also allow for more information to be stored per bit area and or greater bit density. Nevertheless the reader disclosed above utilizes intrinsic magnetic permeability and thus provides the ability to read magnetic media that is effectively immune from corruption by magnetic fields.

In the reader is swept at approximately 3 Hz and 30 Hz under a group of three lines with w 50 microns a lateral separation of 50 microns and d 10 microns. The amplitude and signal to noise ratio SNR in both cases are comparable to situation depicted in where the sweep rate was slower. The insensitivity to sweep rate indicates this approach has a scalability towards higher reading rates. shows data taken using a similar 3 Hz sweep both before and after the media was exposed to a large 6400 Oe field for 60 seconds. Such sweeps of which the post field scan is representative were repeated multiple times with the 6400 Oe field at different orientations to the reader. Within experimental error the amplitude and SNR is unchanged indicating the non erasability of the information in large magnetic fields.

In accordance with the above one can read 10 micron wide non erasable or nonvolatile magnetic lines and distinguish regions of high and low permeability with a SNR of 45 dB. In addition to showing that the read rate is capable of improvement an increase in the SNR is expected to be obtainable by optimizing the performance of our MTJ readers. Since the lower limit on media size is determined by the reader dimensions and fly height and not the thermal stability of the media higher density media are not constrained by the super paramagnetic limit. Through the effect of shunting of flux across a gap in a magnetic circuit by a soft magnetic material a reader can detect an enhancement of the probe field and thus sense the presence of soft ferromagnetic media field in other configurations as reported in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 186 854 and 7 233 142 to Edelstein hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. In fact any detectable change in the probe field magnitude and opr direction due to differences in media permeability should suffice for the reading process. Finally because e beam writing is expensive alternative methods for low cost recording re writing of media consisting of regions of high and low magnetic permeability may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. The ability to write as well as read such non erasable or nonvolatile media can potentially fulfill the growing need to store both large and small amounts of data indefinitely.

Turning now to a comparison of read heads is illustrated. In the left portion the bit is determined by the direction of the magnetic field generated by the remanent magnetization in the bits of the media. This illustrates current magnetic memory technology that senses the direction of magnetic domain fields an extrinsic property. The disadvantages include information can be erased by exposure to magnetic fields or radiation and thermal instability leading to superparamagnetism constraints on the density of information and storage lifetime usually 

Shown to the right in the non erasable or nonvolatile magnetic memory of the preferred embodiment senses the modification of a probe field H by the magnetic permeability of a soft ferromagnet an intrinsic property. The advantages are that the storage is unaffected by magnetic fields or radiation thermal instability does not lead to superparamagnetism constraints limiting information density and storage lifetime and the probe field may be tailored to the read head media.

Types of writing using preferred embodiments of the present invention include A e beam writing optical lithography which may be utilized in conjunction with a non erasable or nonvolatile card system 10 m capability and has the potential for permanent archiving at 50 nm. B Thermal laser writing which may be utilized in conjunction with a non erasable card system 10 m capability and has the potential for permanent archiving at 50 nm or still smaller with less than 100 sec. writing time. C Thermal hot tip evanescent wave or ohmic heating writing which has capability of writing on a 10 nm scale. D Thermal joule writing with an scanning tunneling microscope which has the capability of writing at the 10 nm scale. The thermal writing can be aided by heating the all of the media so that the energy needed for writing individual bits is smaller. Thermal writing can also be performed using a laser and a near field transducer on a 10 nm scale. E Dip pen writing or magnetic ink jet writing which has a potential for writing on a submicron scale. One can use an MTJ reader 20 nm and STO reader with a read time of less than 20 sec.

Thermal writing and reading with MTJ STOs is applicable towards radiation hard DOD space applications magnetic swipe cards and ID tagging. Archiving at current information density is expected for thermal writing with cantilevers shown in and MTJ STO reading is very likely. Information written in this manner is intrinsically robust and difficult to tamper with or change.

Alternatives to highly permeable permalloys and low permeability air for use in conjunction with the present invention include soft amorphous ferromagnetic material with magnetic species e.g. Fe and network glass formers e.g. Si B that hinder crystalline nucleation e.g. Metglas 2605 SA2 with composition FeSiB . Optical or electron beam lithography may be utilized as well as potentially dip pen deposition. For thermal writing on Metglas one could sputter amorphous phase which is magnetically soft and has high permeability greater than 10 000. The crystalline phase has low magnetic permeability 10. An alternative is to go from amorphous to crystalline phase in Metglas by heating above the glass temperature 400 500 C. Another alternative is to go from crystalline to amorphous phase by first melting 1100 C. followed by rapid quenching 10 C. sec. In another alternative for non rewritable storage thin super paramagnetic layers of a magnetic species e.g. Ni could be interspersed with non magnetic layers e.g. Cu . Before heating the layers would have high permeability. Selective heating of regions i.e. bits would induce interdiffusion between the layers resulting in low permeability regions. Presently thermally writing is being done with a laser.

Information on media can be accomplished using heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR read heads a depiction of which is shown in . Using such heads regions as small as 28 by 38 nm may be heated to 700 C.

The preferred embodiment shown in comprises a substrate A having magnetic material for storing information based upon regions of high and low permeability. A reader shown in comprises a sensor for reading information by measuring the magnetic permeability. The bits are read by subjecting them to a magnetic field and measuring their effect on the magnetic field. The magnetic field can be an external field i.e. an external probe field and or a magnetic field from the spin transfer oscillator shown in . The magnetic field at the position of the STO sensor determines the frequency Q and or amplitude of the microwave radiation. Thus measuring the microwave radiation emitted from the STO determines the magnetic permeability of the first and second portions of differing permeability . Optionally when the at least one first or second portion are subjected to the magnetic field they modify the magnetic field at the position of the sensor which in turn determines the properties of the microwave radiation namely the frequency Q and amplitude. The resultant radiation is compared to a reference frequency to determine whether the shift in frequency is sufficient to indicate whether the at least one first or second portion has low permeability or high permeability. The resultant radiation may be compared to a reference frequency using a mixer and comparator and the frequency of the STO microwave radiation is changed when the STO microwave radiation is effected by the magnetic field change caused by the permeability of at least one first or second portion. The at least one first portion of low permeability may be created by heating the magnetic material with a laser hot tip or ohmic heating such that the atomic structure is changed. Alternatively the heating may be done with an evanescent field. In this case a laser wave guide and a near field transducer may be required. The near field transducer operates to produce an evanescent wave is a near field wave having an intensity that exponentially decays over the distance from the boundary from where wave originated. Evanescent waves form in the location shown by the text box when an electromagnet wave encounters an obstruction through which there is a small gap or hole from which a wave may propagate a short distance into a new medium or space. If a laser is placed near a plate with a small hole whose diameter is less than the wave length of the laser light light will propagate a short distance through the hole.

Evanescent waves are created by 1 to coupling a laser output into the wave guide that carries the energy to the near field transducer NFT 2 coupling the energy to the near field transducer and having the near field transducer NFT create the evanescent wave. It is necessary to heat the media without overheating and causing wear on the near field transducer which constrains the wave to about 25 nm. One method for avoiding damaging the near field transducer is to send less of the energy and or send some of the energy via a separate path such that there is two stage heating first stage heating directly from a wave guide and second stage heating from a near field transducer. When using a waveguide the core of the wave guide can have a core of TaO. The first stage heats the media several hundreds of degrees centigrade. The second stage starts heating before the media has cooled from its peak temperature by 10 from the heating from the first stage.

The solid immersion lens has higher magnification and numerical aperture than common lenses because the object space is filled with a high refractive index. The spot size is reduced by a factor of one over the refractive index of the solid lens. The index can be 2.5 for GaN. The energy in the focused spot can be coupled evanescently into the medium situated in the near field of the optical spot near field transducer . The distance between the solid immersion lens and the surface A of the medium A is less than half the diameter of the spot. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that other lens and or components could be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. Solid immersion mirrors may also be used. Near field transducers use apertures or antennas as shown in such as for example an aperture triangle aperture L shaped aperture bowtie aperture etc. A magnetic coil surrounds the solid immersion lens and provides a magnetic field which may be used as a probe field. Although one laser is sufficient two lasers may be used so that one heats the area around the targeted shot so the evanescent wave laser doesn t have to raise the temperature as much as in the singular laser case.

A slider may be used to control height or distance of the support from the media disk A. The height or distance is approximately a nanometer from the surface A of the media disk A as the evanescent wave dies quickly.

The use of heat assisted recording heads are used to thermally change the permeability of Metglass or multilayers of copper and permalloy. In the case of copper which diffuses into the nickel region and destroys the magnetism of the nickel it is envisioned that the device of will achieve more than 600 C. in a 30 nm region. This provides the ability to store at low cost large amounts of information classified or not classified indefinitely without being concerned about the humidity temperature and EM pulses. The information could include photos and cloud storage.

The advantages of the system that includes near field writing as depicted in are high density low cost non erasable radiation hard and not effected by EM pulses indefinitely long retention time rapid access to the information and storage without needing to be concerned about temperature or humidity.

Note that an array of hard disks sometimes referred to as RAID originally redundant array of inexpensive disks allowing the embodiment of to configure many desktop class hard drives for use in RAID setups. The hard disks may be changed by robots.

The system of may be combined with a reader incorporating a spin torque oscillator that radiates an RF signal which is effected by the different permeability regions wherein the effected signal is inputted into a mixer such as that shown in which measures the frequency shift by comparing the frequency of the effected signal with a known reference frequency to determine a difference value which indicates whether the spin torque oscillator is in close proximity to either a first portion of low permeability or a second portion of high permeability and wherein either a 1 or 0 bit is outputted according to the mixer output. Optionally the mixer output may be further inputted into a comparator which compares the difference value to a predetermined frequency shift.

It is noted that magnetization M tends to precess around magnetic field H and to relax into the direction of the field. The spin polarized current can maintain an angle between M H and the system radiates at a microwave frequencies dependent on H and the changing H via soft magnetic material changes the frequency of the STO. The sense element size is 20 nm. Thus one can probably read 20 nm bits if the fly height is of order 20 nm or still smaller.

Using the preferred embodiments reading 10 micron wide permalloy lines with a 45 dB signal to noise ratio have been attained using magnetic tunnel junctions. Spin transfer oscillators can also be used for reading. Potential applications include tagging a magnetic card reader magnetic tunnel junctions used for reading laser thermal writing of magnetic material securely storing large amount of data indefinitely ability to go to sub microns features 20 nm STO and high density magnetic recording.

Alternate approaches within the scope of the present invention include initially using a hot plate to heat Metglas above glass temperature 400 degrees C. so that it will crystallize and enable operator to write a line at a lower localized thermal energy than otherwise. illustrates alternative writing approaches utilizing the principles of the present invention. The present invention contemplates dip pen writing which is at present limited to micron size features. One can use parallel tips . Issues remain with wetting. Another form of thermal writing would involve a hot filament e.g. Tantalum wire that can transfer energy to the magnetic media e.g. magnetic swipe card to form lines of high and low permeability.

Alternate approaches towards writing include e beam writing sputtering soft magnetic film laser control of amorphous and crystalline phases ink jet like printing of the high magnetic permeability bits creating nanoparticle slurry dip pen writing and thermal writing with sub micron pens.

The system shown in for writing information uses an evanescent wave. The preferred embodiment of comprises a disk substrate A which may be for example formed of silicon or glass having media A formed thereon which may be sputtered as described in connection with the previously mentioned embodiments and such as shown in . The media may be for example a single layer deposited on the disk A by sputtering. The media A may be formed of materials such as for example Metglas an amorphous ferromagnet that has a large magnetic permeability whose permeability can be increased or decreased thermally by heating by means that include a heater and or an evanescent wave. When heated to over 400 C. the glass temperature Metglas crystallizes into nanocrystals or microcrystals that have a much smaller permeability.

As an alternative the media A may comprise bilayers comprising a ferromagnet and a nonferromagnetic material that decreases the permeability of the ferromagnet when the bilayer is heated causing the atoms of the nonmagnetic material diffuses into the ferromagnet. An example of bilayer suitable for use with the preferred embodiment is permalloy and copper. Permalloy is 80 nickel and 20 iron. Nickel becomes nonmagnetic if it has too many copper atoms intermixed. The advantage of using thinner layers and repeating them is that lower temperatures and shorter times can be used to cause sufficient diffusion to change the permeability. When the layers are sputtered impurities can be added to the layers. The impurities will move to the grain boundaries. Doing this has the benefit of decreasing the in plane thermal conductivity. One type of impurity that can be used is carbon atoms. Decreasing the in plane thermal conductivity will decrease the probability that neighboring bits will be written when one writes a bit. Another advantage of adding impurities that reside at the grain boundaries is that they will tend inhibit the changes made thermally from propagating to neighboring b its. The top surface of the media is covered by a lubrication layer. A heater A is positioned above the media which may be an HAMR as described in with . The heater can be used via its effect on thermal expansion to control the fly height. A laser illuminates the light cable . Elements A provide the source of the magnetic probe field which is sensed by the magnetic sensor shown in . Also shown in is a cassette for disks and mechanism for inserting disks A A and electronics for operating different components of the system.

As to the media A it may comprise a single layer a bilayer or multilayers. The single layer media consists of a material whose permeability can be increased or decreased thermally by being heating by means that include a heater and or an evanescent wave. An example of a material that can be used in a single layer is Metglas an amorphous ferromagnet that has a large magnetic permeability. When heated to over 400 C. the glass temperature Metglas crystallizes into nanocrystals or microcrystals that have a much smaller permeability. A higher temperature of over 1000 C. and rapid quenching is required to return the Metglas back to its amorphous state. A temperature of 550 is required to have a high diffusion rate of Cu atoms into Permalloy. The heater A is used to heat the media so that the evanescent wave does not have to supply as much energy to heat up the bit. Alternatively light from the laser or from another laser can be used to heat the region around the bit so that the evanescent wave does not have to supply as much energy to heat up the bit. The laser inputs into the optical fiber which carries the light to within one or a few nanometers of the surface. The evanescent wave emerges from the end of the optical fiber a distance that is some fraction of the diameter of the optical fiber. The source A of the probe field may for example be an electromagnet or permanent magnetic whose field is directed parallel to the surface of the wafer and whose magnitude is set at the field that maximizes the sensitivity of the magnetic sensor. The magnetic sensor is either a magnetic tunnel junction MTJ or spin transfer oscillator. The magnetic sensor determines the degree to which the probe field is altered in the vicinity of the permeable bit. The cassette holds two to more than a hundred disks and includes a mechanism for inserting disks on a rotating platform nm below the optical fiber and magnetic sensor. If the system includes the cassette and a mechanical system for changing the disks then the entire system including the cassette laser optical fiber and magnetic sensor must be fabricated and sealed in a clean room to avoid contamination from particles. The electronics with optional processor for operating the different components of the system includes electronics for controlling the laser the system for rotating the disk the system for taking selected disks from the cassette and positioning them correctly for operating the magnetic probe field and magnetic sensor and inputting and outputting information. Suitable inputs and outputs may be connected to the system shown in .

Advantages of the preferred embodiment systems include the features that the information is not erased by magnetic fields or radiation not affected by superparamagnetic limit a card write and read systems with these advantages very large commercial potential for a system that can securely store large amounts of data for decades low cost writing of bits low density applications difficult to tamper with or modify the data e.g. ID cards using laser thermal writing of Metglas high density applications using dip pen or thermal writing of Metglas with heated element or HAMR system.

Shown in is a tapered waveguide alternately utilized in conjunction with a heat assisted magnetic recording subassembly comprising a tapered waveguide . The tapered waveguide may optionally be lined with a aluminum coating to facilitate heat transfer to the media A.

Examples of ferromagnetic material that can be used are permalloy and nickel. The ferromagnetic bit may consist of either a single bilayer of a ferromagnet such as permalloy and copper or the bilayer shown may be repeated to make a multilayer. Permalloy is typically approximately an 80 Ni 20 Fe alloy. Using a multilayer will increase the amount of material and hence the magnetization and the signal. Alternatively one can use Ni or Metglas instead of permalloy. By adjusting the magnitude of the current and its duration one can raise the temperature of a soft magnetic material such as Metglas above its glass temperature or cause the copper to diffuse into the ferromagnetic materials in the bilayer or multilayers. The time dependence of the pulse is also important. If the pulse turns off more quickly more current is needed to reach the same temperature and to cause the same amount of diffusion. If the ferromagnetic is an amorphous material such as Metglas and if the pulse is turned off in millisecond the soft magnetic material cools and will crystallize thereby having a lower permeability. The advantage of this approach is that one can setup a fabrication process to produce large numbers of identical blank memory chips in order to minimize cost. The chips can then be written in a different lower cost system without the need of expensive lithography. Once written the chips can be read by using a probe magnetic field and a magnetic tunnel junction reader or a spin transfer torque reader in a read head to measure how the bits modify the magnetic flux lines of a probe magnetic field. The reader may or may not be part of the media. When using a moving read head the read head either moves over the media or the media is moved under the read head. Readers with the needed smaller dimensions have already been fabricated by many companies. Alternatively one can have a magnetic sensor located near each sensor.

There are alternative methods for writing the media or creating the tunable permeable layer. Specifically the media or tunable permeable layer can be a bilayer or multilayer of copper and nickel or a bilayer or bilayers or multilayers of copper and permalloy. In this case heating the bilayer or multilayer will cause the copper and nickel or permalloy to alloy and the resulting alloy will be non magnetic or less magnetic. This approach will be used in creating a read only memory.

The percentage change in tunneling magneto resistance TMR will be measured by sweeping the reader over the media. As an example for reading micron sized media the reader may have a fly height d of 5 microns and the probe field H 32 Oe. Smaller fly heights will be required for high density media.

Using a different optional design that allows for heating to higher temperatures and faster cooling the tunable portion of an amorphous ferromagnetic material can revert to its original permeability. The tunable permeability portion may comprises soft magnetic material e.g. Metglas that has a high magnetic permeability when it is amorphous and a low magnetic permeability when it is crystalline. The electrodes will allow the current to pass through the heating laser element associated with a particular bit. By passing a current through the laser and by adjusting the magnitude of the current one can raise the temperature of the soft magnetic material above its glass temperature. By using a higher current one can melt the amorphous material. The time dependence of the pulse is also important. If the pulse turns off in millisecond the soft magnetic material cools and will crystallize and have a lower permeability. If the heat melts the Metglas and the pulse turns off in microseconds and the cooling rate is high the soft magnetic material will revert to being amorphous and have a large permeability. In other words if the cooling is slow the magnetic portion of the memory cell will be in a crystalline state with a low magnetic permeability irrespective of whether a current is applied thereafter similar in effect to a write once read only memory comprising 20 nm non erasable bits 

As discussed above a current through the laser can be used to modify the permeability of the tunable permeability ferromagnetic layer. Tunable ferromagnetic layer is a ferromagnetic material whose permeability may be changed by heating. As a result of the changeable natures of the ferromagnetic layer the cell may have one of 2 states at a given time.

Optionally heat sinks may be utilized so that neighboring bits are not affected by the writing. The heat sinks can be for example pillars of Cu. If this is done the array consists of unit that will have an area of 16F2 and there are two bits in each unit. Thus the area per bit is 8F2.

When using Cu Ni bilayers or multilayers the ferromagnetic layer or magnetic bit will become nonmagnetic if heated because diffusion will cause the Ni atoms to have too many Cu neighbors. Ni atoms become nonmagnetic in Ni Cu alloys when they have too many Cu atoms. The change is irreversible. When Metglas is amorphous it has a high permeability and a small coercivity. If Metglas is crystalline it has a low permeability and a higher coercivity. If one chooses Metglas the t ferromagnetic layer or magnetic bit A will crystallize if heated to 500 C. It will be possible but difficult to return the Metglas to the amorphous state. Thus these choices for the tunable ferromagnetic layer will lead to a non erasable memory. If one uses NiFe one has a rewritable memory. Material for ferromagnetic layer or magnetic bit A that are rewritable include Finemet an alloy of Fe Zr Nb Hf B and Cu other versions of permalloy such as Nanoperm and Hitperm. If the ferromagnetic layer or magnetic bit A cools quickly it becomes a disordered alloy and the permeability is much larger than if one slowly cools and the material crystallizes into the compound NiFe. Heating the tunable ferromagnetic layer without affecting the MTJ can be facilitated by providing an air space of 2 to 100 nm between the MTJ and the extra layers. Though extra power is required in what has been described above heating is already utilized in heat assisted magnetic recording HAMR to allow the use of materials with higher anisotropy in order to increase the thermal stability.

The media can be read by using a probe field and a method for detecting the changes in the probe field by placing a magnetic sensor directly over the media. The reader is shown in . The magnetic sensor shown in can be a magnetic tunnel junction MTJ or a spin transfer oscillator. MTJ sensors are devices whose resistivity depends on the magnetic field. One measures the voltage as a constant current passes through the device. The voltage changes as the magnetic field changes. As in standard read heads the read head is translated over the media at a small nm fly height.
