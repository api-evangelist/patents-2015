Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder typically appearing in late adolescence or early adulthood with a world wide prevalence of approximately 1 of the adult population which has enormous social and economic impact. The criteria of the Association of European Psychiatrists ICD and the American Psychiatric Association DSM for the diagnosis of schizophrenia require two or more characteristic symptoms to be present delusions hallucinations disorganized speech grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior positive symptoms or negative symptoms alogia affective flattening lack of motivation anhedonia . As a group people with schizophrenia have functional impairments that may begin in childhood continue throughout adult life and make most patients unable to maintain normal employment or otherwise have normal social function. They also have a shortened lifespan compared to the general population and suffer from an increased prevalence of a wide variety of other neuropsychiatric syndromes including substance abuse obsessive compulsive symptoms and abnormal involuntary movements prior to antipsychotic treatment. Schizophrenia is also associated with a wide range of cognitive impairments bipolar disorders major depression and anxiety disorders the severity of which limits the functioning of patients even when psychotic symptoms are well controlled. The primary treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics for example risperidone olanzapine however fail to significantly ameliorate the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Antipsychotic drugs have shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of the following diseases 

Fibromyalgia which is a syndrome characterized by chronic generalized pain associated with different somatic symptoms such as sleep disturbances fatigue stiffness balance problems hypersensitivity to physical and psychological environmental stimuli depression and anxiety 2012 26 2 135 53 

Schizoaffective disorders includes psychotic and affective symptoms this disorder falls on a spectrum between bipolar disorders with depressive and manic episodes alcohol and drug addiction substance abuse and schizophrenia. 2010 712 14 92011 13 5 291 302 

Now it has been found that the compounds of formula I may be used for the treatment of CNS diseases. The described compounds have been shown to reverse the L 687 414 3R 4R 3 amino 1 hydroxy 4 methyl pyrrolidin 2 one a NMDA glycine site antagonist induced hyperlocomotion a behavioral pharmacodynamic mouse model for schizophrenia described by D. Alberati et al. in 97 2010 185 191. The authors described that hyperlocomotion induced by L 687 414 was inhibited by a series of known antipsychotic drugs. The compounds of formula I demonstrate marked activity in this model. The results are shown in Table 1. These findings predict antipsychotic activity for the present compounds making them useful for the treatment of positive psychosis and negative symptoms of schizophrenia substance abuse alcohol and drug addiction obsessive compulsive disorders cognitive impairment bipolar disorders mood disorders major depression resistant depression anxiety disorders Alzheimer s disease autism Parkinson s disease chronic pain borderline personality disorder sleep disturbances chronic fatigue syndrome stiffness antiinflammatory effects in arthritis and balance problems.

In addition to the reversal of L 687 414 induced hyperlocomotion experiment as described above some compounds of the present invention have been tested in SmartCube an automated system in which the behaviors of compound treated mice in response to multiple challenges are captured by digital video and analyzed with computer algorithms Roberds et al. Frontiers in Neuroscience 2011 Vol. 5 Art. 103 1 4 .

The described compounds of formula I reduce L 687 414 induced hyperlocomotion. This was assessed by using a computerized Digiscan 16 Animal Activity Monitoring System Omnitech Electronics Columbus Ohio to quantify locomotor activity. Animals were kept under a 12 h light dark cycle and experiments were performed during the light period. Each activity monitoring chamber consisted of a Plexiglas box 41 41 28 cm W L H with sawdust bedding on the floor surrounded by invisible horizontal and vertical infrared sensor beams. The test boxes were divided by a Plexiglas cross providing each mouse with 20 20 cm of moving space. Cages were connected to a Digiscan Analyzer linked to a computer that constantly collected the beam status information. Records of photocell beam interruptions for individual animals were taken every 5 min over the duration of the experimental session and the sum of the first 6 periods was used as the final parameter. Compounds were administered either p.o. 15 min before a s.c. injection of 50 mg kg of L 687 414 or i.p. at the same time as a s.c. injection of 50 mg kg of L 687 414. Mice were then transferred from their home cage to the recording chambers for a 15 min habituation phase allowing free exploration of the new environment. Horizontal activity was then recorded for a 30 min time period. The inhibition of L 687 414 induced hyperlocomotion was calculated according to the equation 687 414 horizontal activity drug 687 414 horizontal activity 687 414 horizontal activity 100

IDvalues defined as doses of each compound producing 50 inhibition of L 687 414 induced hyperlocomotion were calculated by linear regression analysis of a dose response data using an Excel based computer fitting program.

As data was not presupposed to be normally distributed groups treated with test compounds were statistically compared with the control vehicle treated group using one tailed Mann Whitney U tests. In statistics the Mann Whitney Utest also called the Mann Whitney Wilcoxon MWW or Wilcoxon rank sum test is a non parametric statistical hypothesis test for assessing whether one of two samples of independent observations tends to have larger values than the other. It is one of the most well known non parametric significance tests. A p value gives the probability that two groups are significantly different from each other and the value of 95 chance that two groups are really different from each other. P values given in table 1 are one tailed since only decreases in locomotion were expected and tested for Mann H. B. Whitney D. R. 1947 On a Test of Whether one of Two Random Variables is Stochastically Larger than the Other Annals of Mathematical Statistics 18 1 50 60 .

As mentioned above some compounds have been tested in SmartCube an analytical system developed by PsychoGenics Inc.

SmartCube was used to compare the behavioral signature of a test compound to a database of behavioral signatures obtained from a large set of clinically approved reference drugs grouped per indications. In this way the neuro pharmacological effects of a test compound can be predicted by similarity to major classes of compounds such as antipsychotics anxiolytics and antidepressants. This approach is ideally suited to screen collections of existing drugs or drug candidates with previously unknown neuropharmacology which could expedite the development of new and unexpected treatments for psychiatric disorders.

Some compounds of the present invention were injected i.p. at different doses 15 minutes before the test. At least 8 mice were used in each treatment group. Digital videos of the subjects were processed with computer vision algorithms to extract over 2000 dependent measures including frequency and duration of many different behavioral states. The results of the classifications are presented as bar charts for each compound and dose mg kg the Y axis indicates the relative probability that the test compound will show efficacy in the specific CNS indication.

The bar charts of example compounds 13 54 58 and 71 at a dose of 25 mg kg are shown in . For comparison the behavioral signatures of the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone are shown in . Compounds of the present invention show similar signatures to those of atypical antipsychotics. An independent analysis was performed on the unclassified data to determine the similarity of the example compounds to active doses of known atypical antipsychotics. For this analysis we use discrimination rate as the measure of separability between the two drugs i.e. one drug s distinguishability from another. A rate equal to 50 or 0.5 corresponds to zero distinguishability. Empirical data has shown that a threshold rate for reliable separation lies above 70 i.e. two drugs showing a discrimination rate of 70 or lower are considered similar whereas a discrimination rate higher than 70 indicates that two drugs are dissimilar. The table below shows the similarity analysis of selected compounds of the present invention to several atypical antipsychotics. In most cases the example compounds show a similarity to risperidone clozapine and olanzapine with a discrimination rate of 0.70.

Therefore it can be assumed that the present compounds have similar efficacies as known atypical antipsychotics.

The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally e.g. in the form of tablets coated tablets drag es hard and soft gelatine capsules solutions emulsions or suspensions. However the administration can also be effected rectally e.g. in the form of suppositories or parenterally e.g. in the form of injection solutions.

The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose corn starch or derivatives thereof talc stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used for example as such carriers for tablets coated tablets drag es and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are for example vegetable oils waxes fats semi solid and liquid polyols and the like depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are however usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are for example water polyols sucrose invert sugar glucose and the like. Adjuvants such as alcohols polyols glycerol vegetable oils and the like can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water soluble salts of compounds of formula I but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are for example natural or hardened oils waxes fats semi liquid or liquid polyols and the like.

In addition the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives solubilizers stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers sweeteners colorants flavorants salts for varying the osmotic pressure buffers masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.

As mentioned earlier medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and if desired one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers. The active compounds may also be used in form of their prodrugs.

As further mentioned earlier the use of the compounds of formula I for the preparation of medicaments useful in the prevention and or the treatment of the above recited diseases is also an object of the present invention.

The dosage can vary within wide limits and will of course be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01 20 mg kg day with a dosage of 0.1 10 mg kg day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult person weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7 1400 mg per day preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.

A compound of formula I lactose and corn starch are firstly mixed in a mixer and then in a comminuting machine. The mixture is returned to the mixer the talc is added thereto and mixed thoroughly. The mixture is filled by machine into suitable capsules e.g. hard gelatin capsules.

A compound of formula I is dissolved in a mixture of Polyethylene Glycol 400 and water for injection part . The pH is adjusted to 5.0 by acetic acid. The volume is adjusted to 1.0 ml by addition of the residual amount of water. The solution is filtered filled into vials using an appropriate overage and sterilized.
