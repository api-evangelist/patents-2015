Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems and networks that more particularly include an online presence for a wagering game machine.

Wagering game machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Traditionally wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings like casinos e.g. resort casinos roadside casinos etc. . The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet shrewd wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network such as the Internet can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Any individual with a personal computing device e.g. a personal computer a laptop a personal digital assistant a cell phone etc. can connect to the Internet and play wagering games. Consequently some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites online casinos . However online casinos face challenges and struggles. For instance online casinos have struggled to provide the excitement and entertainment that a real world casino environment provides. Some online casinos have struggled enforcing cross jurisdictional restrictions and requirements. Further some online casinos have struggled adapting the online gaming industry to a traditionally non wagering game business environment. As a result wagering game manufacturers casino operators and online game providers are constantly in need of innovative concepts that can make the online gaming industry appealing and profitable.

People can use social networks to establish an online presence. For example people can create accounts on social networking websites such as Facebook Twitter Linked In etc. By posting personal information on such social networking websites people establish an online presence . Some embodiments enable wagering game machines to establish an online presence in ways similar how people establish an online presence. Some embodiments enable a wagering game machine to sign up for and own a social networking account a microblogging account a URL for the machine s own online website etc. Using these various internet based social media wagering game machines can establish their own online presence. By owning social networking accounts wagering game machines can post information and media e.g. text video audio etc. to the social networking accounts. Such posts describe activities occurring at the machine. Accordingly players can follow a given wagering game machine s activities by monitoring the machine s online presence e.g. Facebook posts Twitter tweets etc. . For example on Facebook a machine s account may be viewable by everyone not just friends . Players can sign on to Facebook and view the machine s posts about activities occurring on the machine. Therefore embodiments enable players to follow activities on a wagering game machine even when they are not present at the machine.

Some embodiments enable wagering game machines to post various media such as live feeds of wagering game activity e.g. videos of spinning reels for a slots game notifications of certain wins e.g. jackpots progressive wins etc. leader boards for different wagering game activity notification if wagering is currently occurring a history of wagering game activity e.g. a list of the amounts date and time of the last 50 big wins etc. The wagering game activity can also comprise idle activity where active wagering operations are not occurring.

Each wagering game machine can have a personality defined by one or more factors such as a theme of games played on the machine the machine s physical location etc. The machine s personality can then determine at least in part a type of information to publish on the machine s social networking accounts. For example one wagering game machine s personality can require publishing of 1 wins above 50 000 2 the number of times the max button is selected etc. A second wagering game s personality can require publishing of 1 wins above 500 2 any progressive wins etc.

Some embodiments allow for anonymity of people involved in the wagering game activity and people following the machine s online presence e.g. Facebook account the machine s website etc. . In particular some embodiments allow for a range of engagement with a machine s online presence. For example a highest level of engagement for tracking an online presence can include a person becoming a friend of the wagering game machine on a social network. In another example a mid level of engagement can include a person logging into a social media website to view public posts by the machine. In another example a lowest level of engagement for tracking a machine s online presence can include a person accessing a website updated and controlled by the wagering game machine. In such an example the person may not be required to provide identification to access the website. Also wagering game players can opt out of having their wagering game play published.

In some embodiments one wagering game machine can subscribe to an online presence of another wagering game machine. For example wagering game machine A with game theme X could subscribe to wagering game machine B that also has theme X. Accordingly the feeds from wagering game machine B could be posted on the feeds for wagering game machine A. Therefore a person viewing machine A s online presence could also see updates from machine B. For example the person could see jackpot wins from machine B on machine A s Facebook wall.

The system includes a number of servers illustrated as a social network server a microblogging server and a URL based website server that are communicatively coupled to the network . Each of the social network server the microblogging server and the URL based website server define online channels that make up an online presence for the wagering game machine . In particular the social network server is an online channel the microblogging server is an online channel and the URL based website server is an online channel . The online channels together serve as online channels included in the online presence . As noted in the online presence is for the wagering game machine . However wagering game machine may have the same online presence.

In a wagering game player is playing a wagering game at the wagering game machine . A wagering game player is playing a wagering game at the wagering game machine . A person is using the device and a person is using the device .

The wagering game machines can be either physical machines or virtual representations. For example a physical wagering game machine can be a machine located in a brick and mortar wagering game establishment or any other type device e.g. a mobile device that provides for wagering game play regardless of location. In some embodiments a wagering game machine can also be a virtual representation of a machine. For example online wagering play can include virtual casinos that have virtual representations of wagering game machines located on the floor of the virtual casino.

In this example the wagering game machine creates the online presence . A software application executing on the wagering game machine can create the online presence . In particular the software application can use Application Programming Interfaces APIs for accessing the different online channels e.g. social media websites . The software application can create accounts for the different online channels e.g. a social network account a microblogging account etc. thereby creating an online presence for the wagering game machine. Also the software application e.g. a bot can transmit data about wagering game activity to the different online channels. This data is then published or posted to one or more of the different online channels. For example the wagering game machine can publish or post different types of data e.g. text video audio etc. regarding wagering game activity that occurred at the machine. Accordingly persons e.g. wagering game players can follow activity for a given wagering game machine based on its online presence even when the persons are not present at the machine . The audio and video can be based on a live feed from a camera where the audio and video include the reactions of the wagering game player playing the game. Alternatively or in addition the audio and video provided as part of the online presence can be a stream of data that represents what is actually being presented to the player independent of capturing by a camera .

Examples of the different data that is published to an online presence includes live feeds of wagering game activity e.g. spinning reels for a slots game notifications of certain wins e.g. jackpots progressive wins etc. leader boards for different wagering game activity notification if wagering is currently occurring a history of wagering game activity e.g. a list of the amounts date and time of the last 50 big wins etc. etc. Other examples include the different wagering games that are currently available for play at the wagering game machine its current denominations its line counts and its physical location.

The wagering game machine can also post more human like messages that are indicative of wagering game activity. For example if the amount of coin in exceeds a monetary amount in a given time period e.g. six hours the wagering game machine can publish I am busy Or if there has been no wagering for a given time period e.g. one hour the wagering game machine can publish I am lonely The wagering game machine can also publish more personalized messages to specific persons. For example the wagering game machine can publish I have not seen Jim Smith in over a month or I miss you Jane Anderson you were my last big winner. 

Also data for one type of wagering game activity e.g. progressive wins can be published in one online channel but not in a different online channel for one particular wagering game machine. Each wagering game machine can be unique about what is published and to which online channel s to publish. For example each wagering game machine can have its own personality that is defined based on the theme of the game being thereon its physical location etc. The machine s personality can then determine at least in part the type of information to publish for its online presence. For example one wagering game machine s personality can require publishing of 1 wins above 5 000 2 the number of times the max button is selected etc. In contrast a second wagering game s personality can require publishing of 1 wins above 500 2 any progressive wins etc.

Some embodiments can allow for anonymity for the persons involved in the wagering game activity and the persons following an online presence. As described above some embodiments allow for a range of engagement with the online presence. For example the person may want to be anonymous by viewing the online presence of the wagering game machine by accessing the website hosted by the URL based website server . While the person may want a higher level of engagement. For example the person can friend the wagering game machine for the social network hosted by the social network server . Accordingly a minimum level of involvement can begin with a person only having knowledge of the location of the wagering game machine. Based on that knowledge the person can then decide how involved they want to be in tracking the online presence of the wagering game machine. For example the person can track the machine s online presence through a website becoming a friend of the machine on a social media website etc.

As described the wagering game machine publishes information to its online presence without a request for such information by a person. Also wagering game players can opt out of having their wagering game play being published as part of the online presence of the wagering game machine.

In some embodiments one wagering game machine can subscribe to an online presence of a different wagering game machine. For example the wagering game machine can subscribe friend on a social network to the wagering game machine . The wagering game machine can subscribe to other wagering game machines having a same wagering game theme other wagering game machines in a same wagering game establishment other wagering game machine having a same wagering game theme across all wagering game establishments for a given city or region etc. Accordingly the feeds from the online presence of the wagering game machine could be published on the feed for the wagering game machine . Therefore a person viewing the online presence of the wagering game machine could also see the feed updates for the wagering game machine . Such examples are provided below in conjunction with the description of . Also a physical wagering game machine at a brick and mortar wagering game establishment can follow the online presence of a virtual wagering game machine.

The wagering game machine can also establish relationships with persons based on the wagering game activity at the wagering game machine . In particular the wagering game machine provides access to its online presence to a person if that person has performed various activities such as wagered at least a given monetary amount at the wagering game machine won a given number of times wagered at the particular wagering game machine a give number of times on separate occasions etc. For example the wagering game machine may friend the person on a social network because the person has wagered at least 100 at the wagering game machine .

In some embodiments a wagering game player can log into their player account to play the wagering game machine. For example the wagering game player can log into their player account to play the wagering game machine . As further described below this player account can be associated with the player s accounts for tracking an online presence. For example the player account and the accounts for different online channels e.g. social networking websites blogging websites etc. can communicate with each other. Accordingly if the wagering game player has logged into their player account the wagering game machine could send direct messages or make friend requests to the wagering game player through their accounts for tracking an online presence for the wagering game machine .

Also the wagering game machine can make an inquiry to the wagering game player during play of the wagering game machine. The inquiry can be a request for the wagering game player to follow the online presence for the wagering game machine. For example the inquiry can include an option to allow the wagering game player to create an account at one or more online channels to monitor the machine s online presence. To illustrate the wagering game machine can present an input window on one of its displays to the wagering game player during wagering game play. If the wagering game player does provide the necessary input e.g. user ID and password for setting up or accessing an account for accessing at least one online channel the wagering game machine can communicate over the network with the associated server for the online channel s using APIs for the associated server.

In some embodiments websites may provide online play of wagering games typically available at real life wagering game machines. Websites may also provide online non wagering versions of such wagering games. Also websites may provide casual non wagering games that are not functionally equivalent to wagering games but still relate to the wagering games. There may be a synergy between wagering games at a real life wagering game machine the machine s online presence its counterpart online wagering game version its counterpart online non wagering version and its counterpart casual games.

For some wagering games played on wagering game machines there are counterpart wagering games for online play including both desktop and mobile versions. These counterpart games can be functionally equivalent to the wagering game offered on the real life wagering game machine. Also these counterpart games can be either non wagering or wagering. In some embodiments these counterpart games can provide an option to enable the player to access the online presence of one or more wagering game machines with the wagering game. For example the person can play the online wagering version of a wagering game offered at wagering game machine while the person can play an online non wagering version of the same game.

These online versions can attempt to motivate the persons to access the online presence for the wagering game machine . For example these online versions can provide the URL addresses for five of the wagering game machines having the highest payout in the last month including the wagering game machine . This allows the player to access activity of the wagering game through an online presence of a particular wagering game machine . Such access could motivate the persons to play the wagering game version on the wagering game machine . Additionally the wagering game machine itself can provide information about its online presence e.g. account ID for a social network account to the wagering game player.

Also a different website can allow for play of casual non wagering games that relate to the wagering game. The play of these casual games can affect the play of the wagering game. For example some wagering games are episodic wherein a player unlocks new episodes based on game play of current episodes at the wagering game machine. The play of these casual games allows a player to earn points that are credited to unlocking of new episodes on the wagering game at the wagering game machine. Accordingly the player can advance to a new episode of a wagering game based on play of these casual games. For example with reference to the wagering game player can play these casual non wagering games through the website that relate to the wagering game at the wagering game machine prior to arrival at the wagering game machine . The wagering game player may then be further along in the play of the wagering game based on the play of these casual non wagering games. Similar to the online versions of the wagering game described above this website for play of casual games can attempt to motivate the wagering game player to access the online presence for the wagering game machine . For example this website for play of casual games can provide information about the different online channels social network server enabling access to the online presence for the wagering game machine .

The wagering game machine can also provide information on how to access its counterpart wagering versions and non wagering version and play of the casual games e.g. URL addresses of the websites . Also the wagering game machine can provide an option to the wagering game player to convert some of the money into virtual coins used for play of the counterpart non wagering version or transfer of actual monies used for play of the counterpart wagering version. For example if the wagering game player is about to cash out the wagering game machine can provide an option to allow the player to convert at least some of their money to virtual coins for play of the counterpart non wagering version. Accordingly these different aspects of the wagering game can drive players to one another. For example the wagering game machine its counterpart wagering version its counterpart non wagering version and its counterpart casual games can attempt to drive a wagering game player to follow the online presence of the wagering game machine.

As described above each wagering game machine can have its own personality wherein the personality can then determine at least in part the type of information to publish for its online presence. In some embodiments the activity occurring at one or more of the counterpart wagering version the counterpart non wagering version and the counterpart casual games can affect the personality of the wagering game machine. For example if the players are playing a particular bonus game in the online version of the wagering game either wagering or non wagering the online presence is altered to provide information about this particular bonus game.

The social network server can present identifying information e.g. a machine name an avatar thematic artwork etc. for the wagering game machine . In some embodiments the social network server presents descriptive information of the wagering game machine s location history statistics or other properties and characteristics e.g. how to access a wagering game machine what the wagering game machine is paying out etc . The descriptive information can include a map application that shows a map graphic depicting the descriptive information .

The social network server can present a list of friends of the wagering game machine as part of the social network profile for the wagering game machine . As shown the friends include persons and other wagering game machines. The persons that are friends include Amy S. and Marcus M. The other wagering game machines that are friends include Mach 2 Mach 8 and Mach 50.

The social network server can also present friends status feeds as part of the social network profile for the wagering game machine . As shown the friends status feeds can include updates from persons and other wagering game machines that are friends of the wagering game machine . In this example a friend status is notification from Amy S. indicating that she won 500 credits on Mach 1 the name for the wagering game machine . A friend status is notification from Mach 2 indicating that this wagering game machine is busy. A friend status is notification from Mach 50 indicating that this wagering game machine is missing a previous winner Jane Anderson . A friend status is notification from Mach 8 indicating that this wagering game machine just paid out 10 000. Also a comment was adding regarding the friend status . Specifically the comment was from Mach 2 indicating a congratulations to Mach 8 and a notification regarding its most recent payout.

The social network server can also present a status for the wagering game machine as part of the social network profile for the wagering game machine . For example the social network server can present a status message about what the wagering game machine is doing e.g. playing a game with Amy S. . In some embodiments the social network server can provide levels of benefits based on degrees of wagering activity. For example the social network server can require that a player perform certain activities using the wagering game machine or on different wagering game machines e.g. require that the player play games at different locations on different wagering game machines to unlock a game application . The social network server and the wagering game machine can report player activities and accomplishments back and forth to each other to update the game application and unlock access to the game application or access to different levels of the game application once the player performs the activities.

Further the social network server can post videos of player activities e.g. replays wins etc. using a video sharing application wherein the videos are provided by the wagering game machine . The video that is posted can be a live feed from a camera wherein the audio and video include the reactions of the wagering game player playing the game. Alternatively or in addition the video can be a stream of data that represents what is actually being presented to the player independent of capturing by a camera . The social network server can also provide a comments feature to enable friends of the wagering game machine to provide comments about the status of the wagering game machine .

The social network server can integrate with social network applications indicated in an applications console or elsewhere on the social network website . The social network applications can provide levels of benefits e.g. levels of information access rewards privileges etc. for the social network applications. For example social network server can make friend s accounts i.e. social contact accounts linked to a player owned social network account eligible to win sweepstakes offered by a sweepstakes application on the social networking website . In another example social network server can present statistics in a statistical or information application or features. For instance social network server can determine statistics for the wagering game machine such as a popularity of the wagering game machine by all players or specifically by one or more linked social network accounts that are linked to the social network account. The social network server can review a machine s play history e.g. review who has played the wagering game machine and when and submit the play history to a popularity tracking social network application that can list the popularity of the wagering game machine based on the play history. The social network server can also compare an individual player s history to other players histories to generate a comparison of the popularities among individual players.

The social network server can submit the comparison to the popularity tracking social network application to present on the social network website . In yet another example the social network server can control a leader board application that posts rankings of players that are participating in a gaming tournament. In another example the wagering game machine can report information to groups using group applications that feed to groups of users e.g. send a picture of a player at the wagering game machine to a group of friends using a picture sharing application .

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below a flowchart is described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in the flowchart.

At block the online presence module creates an online presence for a wagering game machine. With reference to the online presence module creates an online presence for the wagering game machine . In particular the online presence module can use APIs for accessing the different online channels in creating the online presence. Using the APIs the online presence module can create accounts for the different online channels e.g. a social network account a microblogging account etc. thereby creating an online presence for the wagering game machine . Operations of the flowchart can continue along two different paths the operations in these two paths can be performed serially or in parallel . After the operations at block operations can continue at block and .

At block the online presence module determines that wagering game activity has occurred at the wagering game machine. With reference to the online presence module determines that some type of wagering game activity e.g. player login reel spin jackpot win etc. has occurred at the wagering game machine . Operations of the flow chart continue at block .

At block the online presence module determines whether to publish wagering game activity to the online presence. With reference to the online presence module makes this determination for the wagering game machine . As described above each wagering game machine can have its own personality that is defined based on the theme of the game playable thereon its physical location etc. The machine s personality can then determine at least in part the type of information to publish for its online presence. For example one wagering game machine s personality can require publishing of 1 wins above 50 000 2 the number of times the max button is selected etc. Whereas a second wagering game s personality can require publishing of 1 wins above 500 2 any progressive wins etc. If the wagering game activity is to be published operations of the flowchart continue at block . Otherwise operations of the flowchart return to block to determine a next wagering game activity has occurred at the wagering game machine.

At block the online presence module publishes wagering game activity to the online presence. With reference to the online presence module publishes the wagering game activity for the wagering game machine to one or more of the online channels . In particular the online presence module can use Application Programming Interfaces APIs for accessing the different online channels for the online presence. Using the APIs the online presence module can transmit data regarding the wagering game activity over the network to one or more of the social network server the microblogging server and the URL based website server . As described above the decision of which online channel to publish can be based on the personality of the wagering game machine . Operations of the flowchart continue at block .

At block the online presence module determines whether the publishing of wagering game activity to the machine s online presence is completed. For example the online presence module can stop publishing if a network connection for publishing is unavailable if the wagering game machine is rebooted or a configuration is updated to preclude publication of wagering game activity to the online presence. If the publish is complete the operations for this path of the flowchart are complete. Otherwise operations of the flowchart return to block to determine a next wagering game activity has occurred at the wagering game machine.

At block the online presence module determines whether to subscribe to an online presence of other wagering game machines. With reference to the wagering game machine can subscribe e.g. friend on a social network to the wagering game machine . The decision of whether to subscribe to other wagering game machines can be based on the personality of the wagering game machine e.g. theme of the wagering game the physical location etc. . For example the wagering game machine can subscribe to other wagering game machines having a same wagering game theme other wagering game machines in a same wagering game establishment other wagering game machine having a same wagering game theme across all wagering game establishments for a given city or region etc. Also a physical wagering game machine at a brick and mortar wagering game establishment can follow the online presence of a virtual wagering game machine or vice versa. Accordingly the feeds from the online presence of the wagering game machine could be published on the feed for the wagering game machine . Therefore a person viewing the online presence of the wagering game machine could also see the feed updates for the wagering game machine . With reference to see examples of the status feeds of Mach 2 Mach 50 and Mach 8 being shown on the social network profile for a social network account for the wagering game machine . If it is determined that the wagering game machine is not to subscribe to the online presence of other wagering game machines operations continue at block where another determination is made of whether to subscribe to the online presence of other wagering game machines. Otherwise operations continue at block .

At block the online presence module subscribes to the online presence of other wagering game machines. In particular the online presence module can use APIs for subscribing to the different online channels for the online presence of other wagering game machines. Using the APIs the online presence module can use request subscription to the different online channels e.g. a social network account a microblogging account etc. for the other wagering game machines. For example the online presence module can make friend requests on the social network for those wagering game machines in a same brick and mortar wagering game establishment or virtual casino that have a wagering game with a same theme. Operations continue at block where another determination is made of whether to subscribe to the online presence of other wagering game machines. These operations along this path of the flowchart continue to allow subscription to the online presence of other wagering game machines at later points in time.

Social communication is on the rise. Internet users are enjoying a proliferation of social networking mechanisms e.g. social networking websites online chats blogging social networking applications etc. that are appearing online in vast quantities. Many of those Internet users are also wagering game enthusiasts. Wagering games are also expanding in popularity. Many wagering game enthusiasts are demanding greater access to wagering games and content related to wagering games especially content that includes social networking. As stated previously some wagering game companies have created online wagering game websites that provide a way for wagering game enthusiasts to play wagering games while connected to the Internet e.g. via a web browser . Some online wagering game websites provide various features such as some social networking functionality. Social networking features for example allow wagering game players players to create user accounts with one or more unique identifiers that represent an online persona. One example of a unique identifier is an avatar. Avatars are graphical cartoon like depictions of a social networking persona. These online personas and associated avatars add to the fun of belonging to a social network. Many online casinos however present an unsatisfactory wagering game experience to players who enjoy a more integrated gaming experience.

Some embodiments of the inventive subject matter describe examples of integrating social networking and wagering systems for a network wagering venue e.g. an online casino a wagering game website a wagering network etc. . Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network e.g. public or private that provides access to wagering games such as a website e.g. via wide area networks or WANs a private gaming network e.g. local area networks or LANs a file sharing network a social network etc. or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services such as account based wagering systems e.g. account based wagering game websites account based casino networks etc. .

In some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player i.e. of wagering games and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities at the computer level that are initiated by players. Therefore a player account represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example in some embodiments a player account may be referred to as performing an action controlling an item communicating information etc. Although a player or person may be activating a game control or device to perform the action control the item communicate the information etc. the player account at the computer level can be associated with the player and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore for brevity to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance a player account may be referred to herein in either context. Further in some embodiments herein the word gaming is used interchangeably with gambling. 

The computer can access a social network account e.g. Amy S. s social network account stored on the social network server . The social network server can host a social networking website e.g. the fictional social networking website Facepage . The social network server can include other devices servers mechanisms etc. that provide functionality e.g. controls web pages applications etc. that social network users can use to connect to the social networking website and utilize social networking website features e.g. communications mechanisms applications etc. . The computer can present the social networking website via a web browser application web browser . The social network account e.g. Amy S. s social network account can log in to the social networking website through the computer as indicated by social network user login information . The computer can present the social networking website in the web browser .

The social networking website can present social networking profiles for social networking contacts e.g. friends subscribers etc. that socialize with the owner of the social network account e.g. with Amy S. via the social networking website . The social network account can have a number of social networking contacts. For example the social network user Amy S. can link the social network account to a separate social network account for a second social network user Marcus Miller via the social network server . Likewise the social network account for Marcus Miller is linked to the social network account for Amy S. It should be noted that the social network account is a different account from the player account although Marcus Miller the user may own and control both the player account and the social network account . Further although the social network account and the social network account may be linked they may be linked only as social contacts so that the users Amy S. and Marcus Miller can receive social communications from and about each other but each user maintains separate control of his or her own social network account.

On the account server the player account can include a social networking contact list that can show one or more social network contact accounts from various social networking websites and services. For example the social networking contact list includes linking controls that link or otherwise associate the social network account for the social network user Amy S to the player account . Once linked the player account can show information that identifies the social network account such as an avatar identifier for Amy S. . The player account can also include options settings preferences etc. for presenting social communications from the social network account during wagering games. For example the player account includes a comment display control that when activated will show social communications from the social network account . For example when the social network account views a profile page for the social network account e.g. for Marcus Miller s Facepage profile page a comment feature can present options for the social network account to comment about the social network account e.g. for Amy S. to comment on a picture posted by Marcus Miller on the profile page . The social network server can send a comment made by the social network account e.g. I love that place sent by Amy S. to the account server and or the wagering game server . The account server and or the wagering game server can receive the comment and present it in the wagering game machine to present in the wagering game display . The wagering game machine can present the comment in different ways. In one embodiment the wagering game machine presents the comment in a comment application .

The wagering game server can include a content controller configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the client . For example the content controller can generate game results e.g. win loss values including win amounts for games played on the client . The content controller can communicate the game results to the client . The content controller can also generate random numbers and provide them to the client so that the client can generate game results. The wagering game server can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client . The wagering game server can also include an account manager configured to control information related to player accounts. For example the account manager can communicate wager amounts game results amounts e.g. win amounts bonus game amounts etc. to the account server . The wagering game server can also include a communication unit configured to communicate information to the client and to communicate with other systems devices and networks.

The wagering game system architecture can also include the client configured to present wagering games and receive and transmit information to integrate social networking and wagering systems. The client can be a computer system a personal digital assistant PDA a cell phone a laptop a wagering game machine or any other device or machine that is capable of processing information instructions or other data provided via a communications network . The client can include a content controller configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the client . The client can also include a content store configured to contain content to present on the client . The client can also include a social networking module configured to communicate with social network accounts associated with wagering game player accounts. The social networking module can also be configured to present events e.g. achievements machine occurrences etc. associated with the wagering game player account for a wagering game session and communicate the events to the social network account associated with the wagering game player account. The social networking module can also be configured to enable the client to be a social networking contact to the social network account. The client can thus perform social communications and other related social networking activities that social networking contacts perform on social networking websites e.g. link to social network accounts make comments build relationships etc. . The social networking module can interact with social networking websites as a pseudo user. The social networking module can provide unique identification for the client such as a name an avatar and other identifying features that are associated with a social network account. The social networking module can also convey social communications made from social networking communication mechanisms e.g. social communication features on a social networking website or associated with a social communication application to the client . The social networking module can present the social communications during a wagering game session.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a social network server configured to host social network accounts provide social networking content control social networking communications store associated social networking contacts etc.

The wagering game system architecture can also include a web server configured to control and present an online website that hosts wagering games. The web server can also be configured to present multiple wagering game applications on the client via a wagering game website or other gaming type venue accessible via the Internet. The web server can host an online wagering website and social networking. The web server can include other devices servers mechanisms etc. that provide functionality e.g. controls web pages applications etc. that web users can use to connect to a social network website and utilize social networking and website features e.g. communications mechanisms applications etc. . The web server can also be configured to communicate with the client and present data from the client as social communications on the social networking website.

Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via the communications network . However some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example the wagering game server can also be configured to perform functions of the social networking module and other network elements and or system devices. For instance the wagering game server can communicate with the client throughout a wagering game session and connect the wagering game player account to one of its social network accounts. The wagering game server can control communications between the wagering game player account and a connected social network account during a wagering game session. The wagering game server can also control communications between the wagering game player account and a machine owned social network account which represents a wagering game machine e.g. the client can be a wagering game machine in one embodiment that the wagering game player account uses during the wagering game session.

Furthermore the components shown may all be contained in one device but some or all may be included in or performed by multiple devices as in the configurations shown in or other configurations not shown. For example the account manager and the communication unit can be included in the client instead of or in addition to being a part of the wagering game server . Further in some embodiments the client can determine wagering game outcomes generate random numbers etc. instead of or in addition to the wagering game server .

As mentioned previously in some embodiments the client can take the form of a wagering game machine. Examples of wagering game machines can include floor standing models handheld mobile units bar top models workstation type console models surface computing machines etc. Further wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games or can include non dedicated devices such as mobile phones personal digital assistants personal computers etc.

In some embodiments clients and wagering game servers work together such that clients can be operated as thin thick or intermediate clients. For example one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the client or the wagering game servers server . Game play elements can include executable game code lookup tables configuration files game outcome audio or visual representations of the game game assets or the like. In a thin client example the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets while the clients can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user e.g. player . In a thick client example the clients can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player s account.

In some embodiments either the client or the wagering game server s can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally e.g. by the wagering game server s or locally e.g. by the client . Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management presentation of advertising software or firmware updates system quality or security checks etc.

Furthermore the wagering game system architecture can be implemented as software hardware any combination thereof or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example any of the network components e.g. the wagering game machines servers etc. can include hardware and machine readable media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine readable media includes any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a wagering game machine computer etc. . For example tangible machine readable media includes read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory machines etc. Machine readable media also includes any media suitable for transmitting software over a network.

This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below some flowcharts are described with reference to block diagrams presented herein. However in some embodiments the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.

In certain embodiments the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine readable media e.g. software while in other embodiments the operations can be performed by hardware and or other logic e.g. firmware . In some embodiments the operations can be performed in series while in other embodiments one or more of the operations can be performed in parallel. Moreover some embodiments can perform more or less than all the operations shown in any flowchart.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines a player owned social network account associated with the wagering game player account and connects to the player owned social network account. The player owned social network account can be associated with a social network. In some embodiments a wagering game server or other device on the wagering game network can access the wagering game player account and look for a listing of one or more listed social network accounts that belong to the wagering game player account. The wagering game server can select any one or more of the listed social network accounts. The listed social network accounts can be associated with social networks that are separate from the wagering game network. For example the social networks can be hosted by social network servers separate from and or external to the wagering game network. Nevertheless a wagering game server or other device on the wagering game network can access the listed social network account using social network account logon information e.g. a social networking website address a user name a password etc. stored in the wagering game player account. The wagering game server can use the social network account logon information to connect or logon to the player owned social network account.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines an event that occurs to the wagering game player account during the wagering game session and posts a social networking message of the event to the player owned social networking account. In some embodiments the event can be an achievement by the wagering game player account for a wagering game an availability of a wagering game machine feedback e.g. humorous commentary from the wagering game machine etc. In one example the event can specify that a wagering game machine e.g. Zeus machine is available and can notify players of the wagering game machine s availability. Further the wagering game machine can notify a player s friends that a machine next to a player is open and can invite friends. is an illustration of controlling social networking interactions between player accounts and wagering game machines according to some embodiments. In a wagering game system system includes a wagering game machine connected to an account server and a wagering game server via a communications network . The wagering game machine includes a wagering game display that presents a wagering game . In the wagering game a wagering game player account player account accomplishes a wagering game win. The wagering game machine presents a congratulatory message that indicates that the player account wins a certain amount. The system also includes a computer connected a social network server via the communications network . The computer presents a web browser . The web browser presents a social network website hosted by the social network server . The system transfers a message of the win to the social network server which presents a status indicator comment about the player account s win in a status feed console .

Returning to the system can post the social networking message of the event according to a personality e.g. aggressive sophisticated upbeat etc. that has been programmed into a wagering game machine. The wagering game machine can refer to personality rules that dictate a degree of friendliness aggressive or other personality behavioral traits. The system can provide options for an operator to set the wagering game machine s personality rules. The system can set the personality rules on other factors instead of or in addition to operator preferences including but not limited to maintenance needs locations in a casino availability in a tournament etc.

The system can post the social networking message using a social network messaging application for the social network. The system can provide the social networking message to the social network messaging application of the social network and instruct the social network messaging application to transmit the social networking message. For example the system can update a status on Facebook present a tweet on Twitter generate a comment on MySpace create a post on a blog website or use any other social networking messaging mechanism available on social networking websites and their social communication applications.

In some embodiments the social networking messaging application is provided by a social networking website which the system can utilize directly and indirectly. For example the system can plug in a version of the social network messaging application directly into a gaming application and use the plug in to post comments directly to a social networking website. In other embodiments however the system can indirectly connect to the social networking website by sending instructions to a social network server to post the social networking message. The social network server can send a verification message to the wagering game player account to authorize the posting of the message before the message is posted. For example the social network server can send a verification text message to a player s cell phone to verify or authorize access by the wagering game machine and or to enable posting activity. If the player authorizes the access the player s cell phone can return an authorization message which the social network server can then use as authorization to post the message on the social networking website.

In some embodiments the system can store and use player configured event posting settings that report or filter different types of events. The types can refer to win levels subject matters game themes or any other discernible property or characteristic of the event. The system can determine an event type associated with the event and determine that the event type complies with the player configured event posting settings. The system can then generate the social networking message of the event and present the social networking message on the social network. In some embodiments the system can store the player configured event posting settings with a social network messaging application with the wagering game player account or with the player owned social network account.

In some embodiments the system can also provide a selectable object e.g. a link a button a video player etc. along with the social networking message that will present a replay of the event when a user selects e.g. clicks on the selectable object. In some embodiments the system can receive comments from social networking contacts associated with the social network account and communicate the comments to the wagering game network to present on a wagering game machine associated with the wagering game session. In another example the system can incorporate the comments into the wagering game e.g. present the comments on the reels include images of social networking contacts who made the comments etc. . Additionally the system can reward friends for commenting. In some embodiments the system can receive comments from a wagering game player account via the wagering game machine and post those comments using the social network messaging application.

The flow continues at processing block where the system attributes wagering game activity performed by the wagering game player account on the wagering game machine as social interaction with a machine owned social network account. In some embodiments the system can first link the wagering game machine owned machine owned social network account to the player owned social network account as exemplified in . is an illustration of controlling social network accounts for wagering game machines according to some embodiments. In a wagering game system system includes a computer system connected to a social network server via a communications network . The system also includes a wagering game machine . The wagering game machine can have identifying information e.g. a machine name Mach 1 an avatar etc. that the system uses to sign up the wagering game machine for a social network account hosted by the social network server . The social network server can host a social networking website as well as other social network accounts for a user Amy S. and for a user Marcus Miller . The computer can present the social networking website in a web browser . The social networking website can present a social network profile for the social network account . The social network account may also be referred to as a machine owned social network account because it belongs to or is owned by the wagering game machine . The social network accounts may be referred to as player owned social network accounts because they belong to or are owned by wagering game player accounts. The social networking website can present the machine owned social network account as a linkable social contact e.g. a friend a contact a follower etc. on the social networking website . The system can link the machine owned social network account to the player owned social network accounts using a social contact linking feature from a social network application e.g. a linked friends feature on the social networking website . Some examples of linking features on some known social network websites include the friend connection feature for Facebook and the follower subscription feature for Twitter . In some embodiments the system can link for example the player owned social network account for the user Marcus Miller to the machine owned social network account without any required social interaction by the user Marcus Miller or by Marcus Miller s wagering game player account other than a request by Marcus Miller to link the to the machine owned social network account . In some embodiments however the system may require a certain level of activity or social interaction before the system links the player owned social network account to the machine owned social network account . For example system may only perform the link if the user Marcus Miller logs on to the wagering game machine using a wagering game player account and plays i.e. places a wager on the wagering game machine .

Returning to in some embodiments a wagering game machine can have a programmed personality which the wagering game machine use to perform social interactions with the wagering game player social network accounts etc. For example the wagering game machine can appear to feel bad and possibly de friend a social contact account for neglecting it or for playing on other wagering game machines.

In some embodiments the system can detect a pre defined wagering activity by a wagering game player account and use it as a measure of social interaction with the wagering game machine establish a level of social status or in other words build a friendship with the wagering game machine. For example in the system can determine a significance metric or degree of significance e.g. significance in value amount duration etc. for the wagering activity. The system can determine whether the significance metric of the wagering activity e.g. the wagering game win amount meets one or more pre defined levels of social interaction for the wagering game machine . The pre defined levels of social interaction can be related to level of social status to the wagering game machine owned social network account. If the wagering activity meets the pre defined levels of social interaction the wagering game machine can assign i.e. increase a level of social status or friendship level for a social network account associated with the player account i.e. increase a friendship level for Amy S. s Facepage account because Amy S. s player account player account won as indicated in the congratulatory message . Other examples may include increasing a level of social status if the player account pays a certain amount of money on the wagering game machine over time increasing a level if the player recruits a certain number of friends to play the wagering game machine and so forth.

In some embodiments the system can attribute the social interaction with the wagering game machine by providing social network benefits or rewards associated with a machine owned social network account. For instance as indicated in a comments section the system can reward a player owned social network account with benefits e.g. a video replay of Amy S. s win for any social network account that has a friendship level of 5 or above for the social interaction performed by the player account with the wagering game machine . In other examples the system can provide monetary awards e.g. spins coins credits etc. and or non monetary awards e.g. sweepstakes entries points coupons links to new friends invitations to join groups etc. . In some embodiments the system can provide reward for varying levels of social interaction performed by a wagering game player account. The system can increase the rewards in value as the wagering game player account reaches higher levels of social interaction with the wagering game machine . Therefore in some embodiments the more the wagering game player account plays on the wagering game machine the more the system will rewards the wagering game player account or a player owned social network account associated with the wagering game player account.

Returning to in some embodiments the wagering game player account can link or introduce friends to the wagering game machine. The system can reward friends for making introductions as well as for recruiting others to link to the wagering game machine s social network account. For instance the system can reward introductions or links by making the linked friends eligible to be integrated into wagering game play e.g. via a reel element substitution . In some embodiments the system can provide social networking awards that affect the player owned social network account on the social network and or provide gaming awards that affect the wagering game player account on the wagering game network.

The flow continues at processing block where the system performs social networking account activity between the machine owned social network account and the player owned social network account. In some embodiments the system performs the social networking account activity on behalf of the wagering game machine. A casino controlled device e.g. the wagering game machine a wagering game server an account server etc. can be programmed to perform social networking account activity for the machine owned social network account. In some embodiments the casino controlled device works in conjunction with a social network server and or a social network application on the social network server that receives instructions from the casino controlled device to perform the social networking account activity on the social network server. The system can socially communicate with the machine owned social network account with any linked social network accounts of the machine owned social network account i.e. the player owned social network account or with any other social network account with which the social network allows communication e.g. social network contacts of the player owned social network account . The system can post comments on social network websites using social networking communication features e.g. Facebook comments Twitter tweets Blogger posts etc. . The wagering game machine can have identifying information e.g. a machine name an avatar etc. assigned to it which the system can use to perform social activities on behalf of the wagering game machine e.g. post an avatar on machine owned social networking profiles use a machine name to identify social networking communications made by the machine owned social network account etc. . For example in the system can present a status message about what the wagering game machine is doing e.g. playing a game with Amy S. . The social network account can read the status message from the social network profile for the social network account when the social network account logs on to the social network website .

In some embodiments the system can perform the social networking account activity using social network applications and features on a social networking website and or by sponsoring a social networking application on the social networking website. For example in the system can utilize a comments feature for the social network website. In another embodiment the system can integrate with social network applications indicated in an applications console or elsewhere on the social network website . The social network applications can provide levels of benefits e.g. levels of information access rewards privileges etc. for the social network applications. For example the system can make friend s accounts i.e. social contact accounts linked to a player owned social network account eligible to win sweepstakes offered by a sweepstakes application on the social networking website . In another example the system can present statistics in a statistical or information application or features. For instance the system can determine statistics for the wagering game machine such as a popularity of the wagering game machine by all players or specifically by one or more linked social network accounts that are linked to the machine owned social network account . The system can review a machine s play history e.g. review who has played the wagering game machine and when and submit the play history to a popularity tracking social network application that can list the popularity of the wagering game machine based on the play history. The system can also compare an individual player s history to other players histories to generate a comparison of the popularities among individual players. The system can submit the comparison to the popularity tracking social network application to present on the social network website . In yet another example the system can control a leader board application that posts rankings of players that are performing in a gaming tournament. In another example the wagering game machine can report information to groups using group applications that feed to groups of users e.g. send a picture of a player at the wagering game machine to a group of friends using a picture sharing application . Further the wagering game machine can post videos of player activities e.g. replays wins etc. using a video sharing application .

In some embodiments the system can present descriptive information of the wagering game machine s location history statistics or other properties and characteristics e.g. how to access a wagering game machine what the wagering game machine is paying out etc . The descriptive information can include a map application that shows a map graphic depicting the descriptive information .

In some embodiments the system can provide levels of benefits to the social networking applications based on degrees of wagering activity. For example the system can require that a player perform certain activities using the wagering game machine or on different wagering game machines e.g. require that the player play games at different locations on different wagering game machines to unlock a game application . The social networking website and the wagering game machine can report player activities and accomplishments back and forth to each other to update the game application and unlock access to the game application or access to different levels of the game application once the player performs the activities.

The flow continues at processing block where the system determines social networking activity performed by one or more social contact owned social network accounts which are linked to the player owned social network account and presents the social networking activity on the wagering game machine during the wagering game session. In some embodiments the system can monitor the player owned social network account for social networking communications from one or more social contact owned social network accounts friend accounts associated with the player owned social network account. The friend accounts can send the social networking communications using social networking communication features of the social networking website. The system can format the social networking communication for presentation on the wagering game machine and present the communication on the wagering game machine see for an example of the system presenting the comment feature by the social network account on the comment application on the wagering game machine . In some embodiments the system can present the social networking communication as part of the wagering game.

In some embodiments the system can use social networking activity by friend accounts to affect or control the wagering game player account associated with the player owned social contact account. For example the system can use instructions indicated in friend accounts comments to influence a gaming effect during the wagering game player account s wagering game session. In some embodiments instructions indicated in friend accounts comments can indicate likes dislikes preferences or some other voting feature related to the wagering game session that would specify what the wagering game player account should do during the wagering game session e.g. vote for the player to bet more vote for the player to bet more lines vote for the player to select a specific item vote for the player to stop a reel at a certain time etc. . The system can present the results of the vote on a display on a wagering game machine that the wagering game player account is using during the wagering game session. In some embodiments the wagering game player account can authorize the system to enforce the results of the vote e.g. authorize the wagering game machine to bet for the wagering game player account based on audience vote .

In some embodiments the system can provide rewards to the friend accounts if the social networking communication is presented on the wagering game machine. For example if a social contact owned social network account i.e. a friend account makes a comment for the player owned social network account the system can make the friend account eligible to be integrated into the game or be eligible for some reward. If the friend account also owns a wagering game player account the system can make the friend account s player account eligible to receive rewards on the wagering game network.

In another example the system can provide rewards to the wagering game player account e.g. a promotion a privilege etc. based on an amount of social networking communication received by friend accounts during the wagering game session. For example the system can present a stacked wilds feature which grants the wagering game player account eligibility for more wilds based on the amount of social networking activity e.g. for every ten friend account comments the system makes the wagering game player account eligible for another wild . In another example the system can provides opportunities for a player to increase their chances of receiving a bonus reward or performing better in a bonus game or a wagering game e.g. a better chance of continuing a cascade a better chance of getting a multiplier etc. based on an amount of social networking communications by friend accounts.
