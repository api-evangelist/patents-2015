This application is based on and claims priority to GB Application No. GB1406594.0 filed Apr. 11 2014 the entire contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a method system and computer program for validating a facial image bearing identity document from the face pictured thereon.

The UK Home Office Identity Fraud Steering Committee defines identity fraud as when a false identity or someone else s identity details are used to support unlawful activity or when someone avoids obligation liability by falsely claiming that he she was the victim of identity fraud National Fraud Authority Fraud Typologies and Victims of Fraud Literature Review 2009 . Identity crimes are one of the fastest growing types of fraud in the UK. The UK s Fraud prevention service found that identity fraud accounted for roughly 50 of all frauds recorded in 2012 and that there had been a 9 percent increase in identity frauds compared with 2011 CIFAS 2012 Fraud Trends 17 Jan. 2013 . In December 2012 the National Fraud Authority suggested that identity fraud cost UK adults approximately 3.3 billion each year National Fraud Authority Annual Fraud Indicator 2013 . However this does not include any losses suffered by the public private or charity sectors. Therefore the full cost to the UK from identity fraud each year is likely to be considerably higher. Similarly a National Crime Victimization Survey conducted in the US found that individual financial losses due to personal identity theft totaled 24.7 billion over 10 billion more than the losses attributed to all other property crimes measured in the survey Victims of Identity Theft 2012 .

Automated systems for identity verification and matching are known. For example U.S. Pat. No. 8 322 605 describes an identity matching system which enables an operator to determine the status of an individual based on identification information contained on an identification records provided by the individual and environmental information such as threat levels issued by the military or the Department of Homeland Security. Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 7 110 573 describes an apparatus for automatically identifying and validating identity documents for validating the identity of the bearer of the document and verifying that the bearer has authorization to participate in an activity represented by the document. These prior art systems are limited insofar as they perform identity validation based on features contained in presented identity documents only. However these documents and associated features can be readily altered or forged by fraudsters.

On detection of a fraudulent counterfeit forged or fraudulently obtained document henceforth known for brevity as illegitimate documents users of authentication software and or policing or other authorities confiscate images of the illegitimate identity documents. Similarly investigations and searches of identity farms reveal faces about to be used to create new identities for the subsequent commission of identity fraud. IDscan Biometrics Limited trade mark has harvested the faces from images of illegitimate identity documents detected in routine or otherwise identity authentication processes records of faces about to be used in identity farms and detected in the course of other intelligence operations to create a sizable proprietary archive uniquely comprising of faces of persons specifically linked with a previous fraudulent activity or intended to be and about to be used in the commissioning of a fraudulent activity.

In contrast with features like name address date of birth etc. which can be readily altered on identity documents to create multiple personal identities for the bearer a person s face is considerably more difficult to change. It is particularly difficult to sufficiently alter facial configurations to create a significant number of convincingly different variants thereof. Accordingly the representation of a person s face on an identity document is a particularly useful identifier of the bearer. For the sake of brevity and clarity the term Photo ID will be used henceforth to refer to any document which may be used to verify aspects of a person s personal identity wherein the document bears a permanent photographic or other graphical representation of the person s face. For example a Photo ID may include without limitation a passport driving license social welfare benefit card medical card military identity card club membership card employee card etc.

By focussing on recognition of faces obtained from images of fraudulent counterfeit forged or fraudulently obtained documents and images obtained from identity farms the present invention removes the need for identity document verification with reference to the content and features of the document which can be altered at will. Instead the present invention provides an identity document verification system and methodology reliant solely on the photograph of the face represented on the identity document wherein the photographed face features are not as easily mimicked and altered by fraudsters as other features of the document which are not so intimately and permanently linked with the bearer. Similarly the present invention is distinguished from other face recognition systems and identity document verification systems by its focus on the detection and exclusion of the faces of persons previously detected using an illegitimate document or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document.

The problem of face recognition was considered in the early stages of computer vision and is currently undergoing a revival with recent improvements in computing power and the integration of camera systems in mobile computing devices. In one of the first automated face recognition systems T. Kanade Picture Processing by Computer Complex and Recognition of Human Faces Technical Report Department of Information Science Kyoto University 1973 marker points position of eyes ears nose etc. were used to build a feature vector and recognition was performed by calculating the Euclidean distance between feature vectors of a probe and reference image. The Eigenfaces method Turk M. and Pentland A. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience 3 1991 71 86 uses Principal Components Analysis to project high dimensional and highly correlated face image data into a lower dimensional full rank space where classification becomes easier. Recent algorithms Elastic Bunch Graph Matching Wiskott L. Fellous J. Kr ger N. and Malsburg IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 19 1997 S. 775 779 Discrete Cosinus Transform Messer K. Kittler J. Short J. Heusch G. Cardinaux F. Marcel S. Rodriguez Y. Shan S. Gao W and Chen X Advances in Biometrics Lecture Notes in Computer Science Vol. 3832 2005 p. 1 11 have focussed on local feature extraction to avoid the problems posed by the high dimensionality of face image data so that the extracted features are more robust against partial occlusion illumination and small sample size.

Referring to while certain specific features are illustrated those skilled in the art will appreciate from the present disclosure that various other features have not been illustrated for the sake of brevity and so as not to obscure more pertinent aspects of the implementations disclosed herein. The system of the preferred embodiment may comprise an operator device and an analysis module . The operator device may be locatable proximal to a point of sale and the analysis module may be contained in a second device not shown remotely located to the operator device . The operator device may be coupled with the analysis module by way one or more network and other communications interfaces and through any combination of wired and wireless local area network LAN and or wide area network WAN such as an intranet an extranet including a portion of the internet . Communications between the operator device and the analysis module may be encrypted or otherwise secured from unauthorised interception. In another embodiment the operator device and the analysis module may also be implemented in a single monolithic computer system as well as various other combinations of computer systems or similar devices connected in various ways.

The operator device may comprise an imaging device . The imaging device may comprise a camera or scanner or other device suitable for capturing a graphical representation henceforth known as an image of a Photo ID presented by a candidate client. The operator device may further comprise an extraction module adapted to extract an image of a person s face from the image captured by the imaging device . For brevity the image extracted by the extraction module will henceforth be known as the extracted image. The operator device may further comprise a display device adapted to display at least one image of a face receivable from the analysis module and the image extracted by the extraction module . The operator device may further comprise a decision module adapted to support and process the outcomes of a decision making activity undertaken by an operator of the operator device . Finally the operator device may further comprise one or more communication buses for interconnecting the above mentioned and various other components of the operator device .

The analysis module may be coupled to a primary archive comprising the proprietary IDscan Biometrics Limited archive or other suitable archive of images of faces of persons specifically linked with the handling of an illegitimate document or intended to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document. For the sake of brevity these images will henceforth be collectively referred to as suspect images. In the embodiment depicted in the primary archive is integrated into the analysis module . However the skilled person will understand that the preferred embodiment is not limited to this configuration. Instead and in another configuration the primary archive may be remotely located to the analysis module e.g. within a secure system maintained by appropriate authorities and the coupling between the analysis module and the primary archive operated through a secure communications channel not shown . The primary archive may be securely updatable by relevant authorities. The analysis module may also comprise a secondary archive of further suspect images receivable from the operator device .

The analysis module may further comprise a face recognition face recognition engine block adapted to receive 

It will be understood by the person skilled in the art that the face recognition engine block may alternatively configured to receive a compressed representation of extracted images from the extraction module of the operator device and or the primary archive . This configuration will minimize communication delays in transmitting the large quantities of data contained in a facial image. However computational load will be increased by the necessity of compressing and decompressing the facial image before and after its transmission to the face recognition engine block .

The face recognition engine block may be adapted to identify one or more suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat that most closely match the extracted image FDat or indicate that no closely matching suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat are identifiable from the primary archive or the secondary archive .

The face recognition engine block may further comprise a plurality of face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG adapted to operate in sequence or in parallel to compare the extracted image FDat with the plurality of suspect images FDat and further suspect images FDat and determine whether the extracted image FDat substantially matches one or more of the suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat . In a preferred embodiment the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG may comprise third party face software tools including without limitation the Open Source Computer Vision OpenCV face recognition tool the Lambda Labs trade mark Face Recognition Application Programming Interface API Picasa trade mark SkyBiometry trade mark Face Detection and Recognition API ReKognition trade mark Face Recognize trade mark tool Face trade mark face recognition API Acsys Biometrics Corp trade mark face recognition software development kit SDK Verilook trade mark SDK KeyLemonFace trade mark SDK and NEC s NeoFace Trade Mark Match tool. However the person skilled in the art will recognize that the above mentioned face recognition engines are provided for example only and that the preferred embodiment may use other face recognition engines including those yet to be developed.

For example the or each of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG may be adapted to produce an output vector E E . . . E wherein each output vector Emay include

It will be understood by persons skilled in the art that this representation of the output of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG is provided for example only to elucidate a potential mode of operation of the preferred embodiment. In particular the above simple example should in no way be construed as limiting the operation of the system or method of the preferred embodiment to these face recognition engine outputs. For example the or each of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG may only identify one closest matching suspect image FDat or further suspect image FDat . Alternatively each of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG may identify different numbers of closest matching suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat . Similarly the or each of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG may not provide an indication of the confidence of matching or may provide other metrics by which to interpret the significance of the identified closest matching suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat .

The analysis module may further comprise a process module adapted to receive and process the accumulated outputs from the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG in the face recognition engine block to determine one or more suspect person facial images FDat or further suspect images FDat that most closely match the extracted image FDat or indicate that no closely matching suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat are identifiable from the primary archive or the secondary archive . By accumulating the results of multiple face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG the preferred embodiment provides more robust identity matching decisions.

By way of example in the event one or more of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG identify one or more same suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat as being closely matched to the extracted image FDat the process module may rank the identified suspect images FDat and or further suspect images FDat according to the number of face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG by which each such suspect image FDat and or further suspect image FDat is identified. Alternatively the process module may weight the outputs from some of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG more or less heavily than the outputs of others. Alternatively or additionally in the event the or each of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG provide indications of the confidence of the matching of a suspect image FDat or further suspect image FDat and the extracted image FDat the process module may weight the number of incidences in which the same suspect image FDat or further suspect image FDat appears in the accumulated results O according to the confidence given to the matching by each relevant face recognition engine. Using the above example notation the process module may rank and score the accumulated outputs O from the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG according to ID where ID A subset of the identified suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat most closely matching the extracted image FDat may be selected from the accumulated results O by reference to a pre defined and or user adjustable threshold. In the event none of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG identify any suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat as closely matching the extracted image FDat the process module will produce a null output P 0 .

The person skilled in the art will understand that the above examples are provided for illustration purposes only and should in no way be construed as limiting the preferred embodiment to these process operations. In particular the process module may implement a variety of other operations on the accumulated results O from the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG dependent on the specific nature and content of the outputs Efrom each of the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG .

The analysis module may further comprise a messaging module adapted to receive an output from the process module . In the event the output from the process module comprises one or more suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat closely matching the extracted image FDat the messaging module may be adapted to transmit an alert message A Msg to the display device of the operator device . The alert message A Msg may include a notification that the face image on the presented Photo ID closely matches the face s of persons known to be linked with the handling of illegitimate documents or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document. The alert message A Msg may also include the one or more most closely matching suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat . In the event the output received from the process module is a null output the messaging module may be adapted to transmit a clearance message which may include a notification that no match has been found between the face image on the presented Photo ID and the records of faces of persons known to be linked with the handling of illegitimate documents or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document. The specific presentation and wording of the alert message and or the clearance message may be configurable by the operator. While the alert module is described as being a separate component from the display device the skilled person will understand that one or more elements of the alert module could also be integrated into the display device . Finally the analysis module may further comprise one or more communication buses for interconnecting the above mentioned and various other components of the analysis module .

Returning to the operator device the display device is adapted to receive and display the alert message A Msg . In particular and in the event the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG and process module identify one or more suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat that closely match the extracted image FDat the display device is adapted to display the extracted image FDat together with the most closely matching suspect images FDat or further suspect images FDat so that the operator not shown can use their own faculties to make a final decision regarding the authenticity of the presented Photo ID and the bearer not shown thereof.

The decision module is adapted to provide a prompt to the operator as to whether they accept the authenticity of the presented Photo ID and the bearer not shown thereof and to receive an indication from the operator not shown of their decision in this matter. In the event the decision module receives from the operator not shown an indication that they wish to reject the presented Photo ID the decision module is adapted to store the image of the Photo ID previously captured by the imaging device and or the extracted image FDat therefrom in the secondary archive of the analysis module . In a further enhancement the image of the Photo ID and or the extracted image FDat may be linked with the image of the closest matching persons known to be linked with the handling of illegitimate documents or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document identified by the face recognition engine block . In this way an archive record is assembled providing intelligence on suspect identity documents connected with the fraudster and exemplifying for example changes through ageing of the fraudster and the fraudster s identity documents so that subsequent attempts to fool facial recognition engines through progressive superficial cosmetic changes may be intercepted and outwitted.

Thus the operator device and the analysis module form a closed loop adaptive system wherein feedback from the operator by way of the image of the Photo ID and or the extracted image FDat can be returned to the analysis module to inform subsequent face recognition processes undertaken by the face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG and improve the overall performance and generalisation abilities of the system of the preferred embodiment.

Referring to in combination with in a first step of the method of the preferred embodiment an image is captured 40 of a presented Photo ID by the imaging device in the operator device . An image extracted image FDat of a person s face is then extracted by the extraction module from the image captured of the presented Photo ID . The extracted image FDat is then compared by a plurality of face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG with images of the faces of persons known to be linked with the handling of illegitimate documents or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document suspect images FDat and or the faces of persons further suspect images FDat who previously presented suspect Photo IDs to the system of the preferred embodiment.

The accumulated outputs Eto E from the plurality of face recognition engines ENG ENG. . . ENG are processed . In the event a match is found between the extracted image FDat and one or more faces of persons known to be linked with the handling of illegitimate documents or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document FDat and or faces of persons who previously presented suspect Photo IDs FDat an alert message is transmitted 50 to the operator and the extracted image FDat is displayed to the operator together with the one or more matching images of faces of known criminals and or persons who previously presented suspect Photo IDs. The operator is provided 54 with an option to accept or reject the presented Photo ID . In the event the operator chooses to reject the presented Photo ID the image of the presented Photo ID and or the extracted image FDat therefrom are stored 58 in the secondary archive . In the event no a match is found between the extracted image FDat and one or more faces of persons known to be linked with the handling of illegitimate documents or about to be used in the creation of an illegitimate document FDat and or faces of persons who previously presented suspect Photo IDs FDat a clearance message is transmitted 60 to the operator.

Alterations and modifications may be made to the above without departing from the scope of the invention.
