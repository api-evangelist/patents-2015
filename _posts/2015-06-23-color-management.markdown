title: Color management
abstract: Embodiments of techniques or systems for color management are provided herein. A graphic input may be received which includes pixels associated with color codes. Respective pixels or portions of the graphic input may be binned or indexed into color code bins. Each color code bin may be indicative or be associated with a color or color code. Sample color gradients may be assigned color codes based on counts for respective color code bins. A background or layers may be generated based on the sample color gradients. Additionally, patterns or aspects may be generated for the background or layers. In this manner, color management may be provided in the form of a dynamic, changing, or moving background which may be unique to the graphic input due to the patterns (e.g., movement patterns, shape patterns, movement speed, etc.) and sample color gradients determined based on the graphic input.
