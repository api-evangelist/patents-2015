title: Tracking the use of at least one destination location
abstract: Tracking the use of at least one destination location is disclosed. Initially, four or more first images are received from a first camera having a first field of view. It is then determined that the first vehicle is stopped within the at least one destination location at a first time and that the first vehicle has left the at least one destination location at a second time. A first characteristic of an occupant of the first vehicle based on a first image is determined to correspond to a second characteristic of the occupant of the first vehicle based on a second image. It is then determined that the occupant of the first vehicle traveled between the first vehicle and a payment station. Payment information specifying a period of time that was received by a third-party parking payment system is received. The period of time is then associated with the first vehicle.

This invention relates to the use of cameras to identify vehicles and track and control the use of parking spaces by the vehicles.

Various municipal and private parking operators have extensive legacy parking management systems for managing the use of and obtaining revenue for the user of destination locations for vehicles such as parking spaces for wheeled motor vehicles. The substantial rework and expense that traditionally has been required to upgrade such legacy systems to full automation poses a substantial up front capital investment that prevents many parking operators from performing such upgrades.

What is needed is a fully automated and autonomous parking management system which easily integrates with existing parking payment systems including systems that have already been installed and operational for some time. Doing so unlocks new revenue opportunities and efficiencies for the parking facility operators that are previously untapped.

In an embodiment there is a method of tracking the use of at least one destination location the method comprising receiving a plurality of vehicle images captured by a plurality of cameras wherein each vehicle image includes an image of a first vehicle the plurality of cameras includes a first identification camera the plurality of cameras includes a destination camera the vehicle images include one or more first identification images captured by the first identification camera a plurality of destination images captured by the destination camera including a first destination image captured at a first time a second destination image captured at a second time after the first time and a third destination image captured at a third time after the second time determining a first unique identifier for the first vehicle based on the first identification images determining a first plurality of characteristics for the first vehicle based on the first identification images determining a second plurality of characteristics for a vehicle based on one or more of the destination images determining that the second plurality of characteristics correspond to the first plurality of characteristics determining that an image of the first vehicle is included in the plurality of destination images based on the determining that the second plurality of characteristics correspond to the first plurality of characteristics determining the first vehicle is stopped at a first destination location based on the first destination image and the second destination image determining the first vehicle has left the first destination location based on the third destination image indicating that the first vehicle began use of the first destination location at the first time and indicating that the first vehicle completed use of the first destination location at the third time wherein the preceding steps of receiving determining and indicating are performed by one or more computers collectively programmed to perform the preceding steps.

Various benefits obtained by the disclosed subject matter include but are not limited to 1 offering hands off self enforcement for parking citations 2 offering hands off self enforcement for parking citations that integrates with existing in place parking payment infrastructure 3 a smaller number of sensors and associated reduction in installation costs in comparison to techniques relying on proximity sensors that identify the presence of only one or very few vehicles a factor which can prove significant for the management of parking spaces in large open areas such as parking lots 4 leveraging commercial off the shelf COTS technologies and associated reduction in equipment costs for vehicle detection and parking enforcement 5 improvements in software based vehicle detection techniques can be quickly updated throughout the system particularly in an embodiment where image processing is performed remote from the cameras and realizing improvements in vehicle detection without hardware changes throughout a parking management system 6 the ability to rapidly make changes in system behavior system wide or in connection with a more narrowly defined subset of parking spaces.

Identification camera illustrates one of a plurality of such cameras included in system . For the convenience of discussion only a single Identification camera is illustrated in . Identification camera is positioned such that it may capture images of vehicle identifiers such as but not limited to an automobile license plate or a label affixed to a vehicle that provides a vehicle identifier in a format such as but not limited to a QR code or a bar code. Images captured by Identification camera such as image are used in conjunction with images captured by one or more destination cameras in order to identify individual vehicles such as vehicle and record their usage of various destination locations. Examples of destination locations for wheeled motor vehicles include areas designated as appropriate for parking although possibly subject to various restrictions such as but not limited to parking spots and areas designated as inappropriate for parking such as but not limited to bus stops fire lanes areas around fire hydrants sidewalks areas within X feet of an intersection driveways islands medians bicycle lanes pedestrian crossings. For example server system may be configured to determine when a vehicle is parked at a bus stop and request or take action upon that determination such as requesting the vehicle be towed or issue a citation by mail. In an embodiment other parking violations may be identified such as a vehicle not being properly parked within a designated parking space parking more than 1 foot from a curb parking with the left wheels toward the curb parked facing wrong direction back in angle parking and abandoned vehicles left in a particular location for X or more consecutive days . In an embodiment an Identification camera may also include a mobile or handheld camera including for example a camera included in a smartphone.

Destination camera illustrates one of a plurality of such cameras included in system . For the convenience of discussion only a single destination camera is illustrated in . Destination camera is positioned such that it may capture images of one or more destination locations such as but not limited to automobile parking spots. Typically destination camera will be mounted at an elevation such as but not limited to on a lighting or telephone pole or on the fa ade or top of a building. By mounting destination camera at an elevation the field of view of images such as image captured by destination camera can include and therefore be used to monitor multiple destination locations. In an embodiment a destination camera may also include a mobile or handheld camera including for example a camera included in a smartphone. In an embodiment a destination camera may be included in a parking meter body. In an embodiment a destination camera may be provided by a space satellite imaging camera potentially obviating a need for destination cameras installed throughout a municipality. In an embodiment a destination camera may be included in an air vehicle such as but not limited to a blimp or other airship or an unmanned air vehicle and may be autonomously operated for extended periods of flight.

Although Identification camera and destination camera may be configured to each directly communicate with network via respective communication links and . In another embodiment Identification camera may be configured to communicate directly with and relay data through destination camera such that rather than Identification camera being configured to communicate directly with network via communication link it communicates with destination camera via communication link and destination camera communicates with network via communication link such that destination camera serves to relay data to and from identification camera . Communication link may be a wireless networking link. Although illustrates an example with a communication link between the two cameras and this may be extended to data being sent from or to a given camera by relaying the data through multiple cameras. Additionally a wireless mesh network may be established among a plurality of cameras providing a fault tolerant and self configuring wireless communication medium among the cameras. By using wireless communications instead of hardwired links the number of hardwired communications links in the system as a whole and expense and labor associated with installing and maintaining such hardwired links can be reduced. Also this may serve as a useful alternative to using for example cellular data communications for conveying data to network as typically the cost of cellular data communications is significantly greater than via a hardwired link. However wireless communication is not required and some or all cameras may communicate via a hardwired link.

Server system comprises one or more computer systems which provide central data storage data retrieval and processing services. The computer systems included in server system will generally each include a random access memory and a processor . Server system includes database which is used to record information such as usage of destination locations such as parking spaces by vehicles vehicle account information identifications of vehicles obtained via identification camera images observations of vehicles obtained via destination camera images destination reservation information billing information and payment information. Database may be implemented for example using software programs such as MySQL Oracle or DBASE. Database may comprise multiple database instances executing across multiple computer systems.

In an embodiment server system is configured to perform vehicle and vehicle identification recognition from images captured by identification cameras such as identification camera and destination cameras such as destination camera . Further server is configured to perform decision making based on the recognized information such as determining the usage of destination locations and when the usage of a destination location is in violation of use restrictions for the destination location. This embodiment in which image processing and decision making are centralized in server system exploits Moore s Law in which the number of transistors in a microprocessor and a corresponding amount of data processing capability doubles every 18 months and Nielsen s Law which hypothesizes that bandwidth speeds grow by 50 per year. Significant benefits can be realized by this centralized approach. Not only can the intelligence feature richness of server applications be quickly scaled up with ever cheaper and faster CPU power new features and applications can also be quickly rolled out to onsite thin client devices. Manufacturing costs are generally reduced by use of COTS commercial off the shelf components throughout the system. In addition a highly networked system will be well positioned to take advantage of updates in technology services available via network. Finally as microprocessor and bandwidth costs continue to decrease the costs of expansion in size or capability can be realized at ever reducing costs.

In another embodiment some functions may be distributed to other components of the system. For example identification camera may be configured to identify the presence of vehicle identification information such as license plate numbers in captured images. In such an embodiment the amount of data communication bandwidth between identification camera and server system and the amount of processing which must be performed by server system may be significantly reduced with a tradeoff in that identification camera needs to be a more sophisticated device capable of performing image processing functions capable of for example identifying the presence of vehicles in images identifying the presence of vehicle identification information in images and or extracting vehicle identification information from images. By way of another example the identification and destination cameras can be programmed to determine characteristics of vehicle images as detailed below in connection with rather than perform such determinations using server system . How functions may be distributed throughout the system as a whole would depend on the anticipated costs of providing distributed functionality such as providing the necessary processing hardware and programming to identification and or destination cameras weighed against the anticipated costs to convey images captured by the cameras to a central location for processing. Moving programmed functions from one computer system to another to accommodate communication bottlenecks such as from server system to identification camera and ensuring that adequate processing resources are provided for various computer systems to perform these functions is a routine exercise which is well within the skill in the art.

Mobile device comprises a programmable computer an identification camera and wireless data communication capability for communicating with server system . In an example if vehicle were determined to be using a destination location but a unique identification for vehicle had not been determined mobile device could be dispatched to the destination location and an image of vehicle captured from which a unique identification for vehicle could be obtained. In additional to capturing an image of a license plate as done by identification camera mobile device can also be configured to capture a vehicle VIN identifier tag which may be helpful for vehicles lacking license plates. This helps overcome occasional situations such as occlusion of vehicle by another vehicle as it passes through the field of view for identification camera in which identification camera is unable to capture images effective for uniquely identifying vehicle . Multiple mobile devices may be included in the system in order to better ensure timely capture of images across all of the destination locations managed by server system . In an embodiment mobile device may also be configured to provide features useful for parking enforcement. For example mobile device may be configured to print out a paper citation for parking violations identified by server system .

Onsite payment system is one of a plurality of devices which offers a direct physical interface generally located near one or more destination locations for an end user to submit a payment or an agreement to pay for the use of a destination location. Examples of payment system include but are not limited to a parking meter dedicated to an individual destination location a payment station associated with several street parking spaces and a payment station for destination locations provided in a parking lot or garage. In an embodiment onsite payment system may include a destination camera which captures images for one or more destination locations.

End user system is a programmable computer system by which an end user such as a driver of vehicle may interact with server system . Examples of such systems include but are not limited to a desktop computer system with a web browser application a smartphone with a web browser application or dedicated parking application and an in vehicle system included in vehicle . End user system may be used for example to create an end user account for repeated interactions with server system reserve use of destination locations request identification of an available destination location and submit payment information for the use of a destination location.

In an embodiment end user system may be configured to request and obtain information from server system describing available destination locations for a given area. In an example end user system may further be configured to obtain and or request particular criteria for acceptable destination locations such as destination locations which are in a parking garage or not on street parking such as a parking lot . In addition to location information other information such as but not limited to cost of use for a given destination location may be obtained by end user system . End user system may be further configured to request and obtain information for currently available destination locations and or destination locations available at a specified point or range of time in the future. End user system may be further configured to provide a graphical user interface to the end user showing specific locations such as on a map of one or more of the available destination locations obtained from server system . In an embodiment where multiple destination locations are available at a parking facility such as a parking garage or parking lot end user system may be configured to broadly indicate the availability possibly indicating a number of available destination locations of a destination location at the parking facility rather than individually identifying each destination location. End user system may be configured to receive an indication of a selected destination location from the end user. End user system may be further configured to provide guidance such as turn by turn directions to the selected destination location. End user system may be further configured to instruct server system to reserve use of an available destination location.

Manual review system is a programmed computer system by which a human operator provides assistance to server system for identifying vehicles such as vehicle . For example server system may determine that an error has occurred in performing an automated machine based determination of a unique identifier for vehicle from images such as image captured by identification camera . In response to this error server system may request assistance from human operator to determine a unique identifier such as a license plate number for vehicle . Manual review system provides a user interface by which human operator may review image and perhaps other images captured by identification camera or other cameras. For example human operator can rewind the video footage manually and freeze frame forward in order to manually determine the vehicle license plate number and state province information. Via this interface human operator may provide an identification of vehicle or indicate that human operator was unable to determine an identification for vehicle which may result in mobile device being dispatched to a destination location in order to make a positive identification of vehicle . More than one manual review system may be made available for use by server system depending on the volume of information processed by server system . Additionally human operator may be a member of a Live Operator team discussed in more detail below.

In an embodiment one or more of the identification and destination cameras capture images at a higher frame rate and or resolution than the images transmitted from the cameras to server system . Although not all of the image data captured by such cameras is transmitted to server system in the interest in conserving possibly expensive network communication bandwidth for example a cellular data network and limited image processing resources available at server system such cameras can buffer a limited amount of the full image data that they capture such as in a circular buffer. Additionally such cameras are configured to respond to requests for such additional image data including for example portions of higher resolution images which may be useful for license plate recognition. By this mechanism server system may automatically determine that additional images may be useful for identifying and tracking vehicles or manual review system may request various images in order to resolve an error raised by server system .

Parking operation system is a programmed computer system by which a parking facility operator may interact with and control server system . Server system is expected to operate autonomously with little input required by a parking operator the majority of the time. However occasionally there are instances when the parking facility operator personnel take an active part in its operation. For example parking operation system may provide a live indication as to how many and which destination locations are being used and or are available. As another example parking operation system may provide a live indication as to destination locations in which vehicles are violating usage restrictions allowing parking facility operator personnel to take action for such violations as deemed necessary.

Identification images captured by identification camera are used for two primary purposes 1 obtaining a unique identification of a vehicle such as by reading an identifier from a license plate mounted on the front or rear of the vehicle and 2 determining various characteristics of the vehicle so that it may be determined that an image of a vehicle obtained by another camera corresponds to an identified vehicle as discussed below in connection with . In the example identification image shown in a view of a vehicle and its license are available for processing by server system . Multiple identification images may be used for determining vehicle characteristics such as speed and direction of travel.

In the field of license plate readers various techniques are known in the art for reliably capturing images effective for reliable reading of vehicle identifiers under a variety of illumination and vehicle conditions. One nonlimiting example is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 016 518 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In an embodiment issues arising from the lack of natural illumination during night may be avoided where restrictions for the use of destination locations are only in effect during daylight hours.

In an embodiment machine vision techniques for obtaining vehicle identifiers may be performed by identification camera . In such an embodiment the amount of data sent from identification camera to server system may be significantly reduced as a vehicle identifier can be sent in place of identification images. However one or more identification images may still be transmitted to server system for storage and or determination of vehicle characteristics by server system although in an embodiment this may also be performed by identification camera .

In an embodiment server system may recognize it is only able to obtain a portion of a vehicle identifier perhaps as a result of certain particular conditions such as the angle of the vehicle or a closely following vehicle. In such a case server system may further rely on a second identification image captured by a second identification camera to obtain the remaining portion of the identifier.

In an embodiment identification camera may have pan tilt and or zoom capability which may be used for server system to obtain a more detailed view of a vehicle or may be used by parking facility operator personnel via a user interface on parking operation system to monitor particular areas of interest viewable by identification camera . In such an embodiment server system may be configured to perform a coordinate transformation in order to accurately determine vehicle characteristics while varying the field of view of identification camera .

In an embodiment when a vehicle appears in the field of view of identification camera server system performs one or more of six tasks. In the first task server system detects the presence of one or more vehicles based on one or more images captured by identification camera . In an embodiment server system may be configured to detect the presence of a vehicle based on differences in color between the vehicle and the background and a determination that a size of a total shape for a potential vehicle is larger than a specified minimal vehicle size adjusted for any applicable zoom level. Specifically such an algorithm may compare colors of all the pixels in an image against each other. Pixels are divided into rows and columns for example an absolute location may represent a pixel located on Row and Column . Since the image likely includes other non vehicle objects such as but not limited to a fire hydrant pedestrian cars grass or road marking paint the algorithm may be configured to detect groups of pixels with similar colors a range of colors that be considered to be similar may be specified in a system configuration such as that similar colors may be a maximum of 2 shades difference with reference to shades indicated by a color chart . The locations of these pixels are then mathematically computed to determine whether they form a shape larger than the minimal vehicle size for example a relative size of 10 30 may represent a shape measuring 10 rows by 30 columns . Vehicles appearing in images captured by identification camera tend to appear to be parallelograms rather than rectangular in shape due to the viewing angle. Therefore the determination may take this factor into account.

A further refinement could be made to accommodate holes or imperfections in a detected shape due to for example a reflection of the sun a windshield area or a roof rack. For example the algorithm may specify a number of shapes of a particular minimum size up to certain distance or pixels away from each other which may correspond to portions of a vehicle such as a hood roof and trunk which are typically of the same color.

Once a vehicle has been detected an entry is recorded in a portion of database corresponding to identification camera along with information including for example a date time color of vehicle size of vehicle locations of pixels and zoom level. This information may be used in conjunction with other detections of the vehicle to identity of the vehicle. Alternatively such information may be temporarily recorded in volatile memory such as RAM.

In the second task server system detects the presence of license plates and or additional identification such as but not limited to decals on vehicles in images captured by identification camera . Once a license plate and or additional identification has been detected an entry is recorded in a portion of database corresponding to identification camera along with information including for example a date time license plate state province decal details for example a type an identifier and expiration locations of pixels and zoom level. This information may be used in conjunction with other detections of the vehicle to identify the vehicle in other images such as images captured by a destination camera.

In the third task server system identifies vehicles that are moving versus vehicles which are stationary based on multiple images captured by identification camera .

In the fourth task server system identifies license plates and or additional identifications that are moving versus license plates and or additional identifications which are stationary based on multiple images captured by identification camera . In an example server system may be configured to 1 based on license plates and or additional identification information obtained such as via OCR from the current image find corresponding matches in previous images for example by reviewing data stored in database or memory and 2 once such matches are found compare the locations of pixels between the current image and previous images taking into account any change in zoom level. Based on such processing one or more of the following scenarios may be detected. A if locations of pixels are unchanged or have unchanged below a predetermined threshold all license plates and or additional identifications are deemed to have remained stationary. In this scenario a simple update of the date and time is performed for existing entries in database or memory for the vehicles. B if pixels associated with one or more license plates and or additional identifications are at new locations the one or more license plates and or additional identifications are determined to have moved. Server system may calculate speed and direction of travel for these vehicles and update database or memory with this information along with updated locations. C if one or more license plates and or additional identifications have disappeared from the current image server system may be configured to remove data recorded in database or memory for such vehicles. D if one or more license plates and or additional identifications have newly appeared in the current image data associated with the new license plates and or additional identifications may be recorded in database or memory. In an embodiment server system may determine that one of the new vehicles corresponds to a vehicle recently determined to have disappeared and may treat the view of the vehicle as having been temporarily obstructed. E if all license plates and or additional identifications have disappeared from the current image data from database or memory from the preceding interval may be removed in connection with the license plates and or additional identifications therein. However some data may be retained in order to perform vehicle tracking to or from an identification camera as discussed previously.

In the fifth task server system mates identified license plates and or additional identifications to vehicles detected in the first task. For example server system may be configured to compare attributes of license plates and or additional identifications such as for example absolute pixel location direction of travel and speed to such attributes determined for possible vehicles and attempt to mate each license plate and or additional identification to a vehicle.

In the first through fifth tasks server system may apply machine vision techniques to identify additional identification on vehicles for the purpose of confirming that either the particular vehicle is eligibility of parking in a particular parking space or the vehicle license registration is current and valid. These other types of unique identification include but are not limited to a handicap parking decal or mirror hanger a resident only parking decal and a registration decal typically adhered to license plates.

In the first through fifth tasks OCR optical character recognition may be performed on any license plate image s in order to obtain an alphanumeric license plate number along with state province of issue. Note the license plate observed can be either the front or the rear license plate typically identification cameras are provided which point both ways up and down a street . The obtained license plate information is used to obtain a unique vehicle identifier used for recording information about the vehicle in database . In certain configurations the first task may be performed locally on the identification camera where the license plate number and state province data are transmitted to the server system in a concise data format. This is especially true when the underlying communications network between the identification camera and server system does not provide sufficient bandwidth for example 1 Mb sec may be deemed a minimum threshold for streaming images or is deemed to be too costly for example more than 10 MB . Multiple vehicles may be present simultaneously in identification image . In an embodiment server system can track up to 10 sets of vehicle license number plate information simultaneously from a single identification camera at any given time.

In the sixth task a vehicle is tracked as it moves across the field of view of identification camera . There is overlap between an image captured by identification camera and a neighboring destination camera such that a vehicle is within the field of vision of both cameras for a minimum of 2 seconds at a speed of 15 MPH approximately 44 feet . In general neighboring or nearby camera positions are determined to ensure this overlap occurs. As the two cameras have uniquely different angles of view obtaining overlapped images of any given vehicle from both of these cameras is treated as a positive identification of the vehicle via license plate number obtained from the identification image along with an exact destination location the vehicle has occupied in the event the vehicle parks .

In an embodiment preliminary motion detection may be used to reduce the number of identification images which are captured and or analyzed as there may be significant periods of time during which no vehicles pass through the field of view of identification camera .

An OCR rate is only one of the useful measurements in assessing identification performance. For example while it is impressive that of 100 license plates recorded captured server system failed to OCR only 1 of the license plates in other words was not able to produce an alpha numeric plate number if such a configuration including factors such as server system programming identification camera placement and identification camera image quality failed to capture register other license plates in other words additional license plate images were not identified as such by server system the overall effectiveness is only 49.5 . Furthermore license plate recognition systems are typically tuned to read license plates from a particular state province along with ones from a number of the surrounding states provinces. License plates from various states provinces have different colors and contrast for letters and background. In an embodiment the capture rate is at least 95 and the OCR accuracy is at least 95 yielding a minimum overall effectiveness of at least 90.25 .

Destination images captured by destination camera are used for two primary purposes 1 identifying when destination locations are being or not being used by vehicles and 2 determining various characteristics of vehicles so that vehicles may be tracked as they traverse from camera to camera by determining whether the characteristics determined from images captured by neighboring cameras correspond to one another as discussed below in connection with .

In another example not illustrated in the drawings destination camera may be positioned such that image provides a perspective view of one or more destination locations. Although illustrate the specification of rectangular areas and for destination locations other shapes may be used such as polygons which is useful where destination camera is positioned such that a destination location is seen in perspective . The GUI described below in connection with may also be configured to provide user interface elements which may be used to specify with an overlay on an image feed the position and extent of destination locations within the field of view of a camera. Additionally the GUI may provide tools for assigning identifiers for destination locations and possibly various characteristics about destination locations such as but not limited to whether they are parking spaces no parking locations and time and or date based restrictions on use.

In an embodiment when a vehicle appears in the field of view of destination camera server system performs two tasks. For the first task server system may be configured to 1 be aware of any and all vehicles present in the field of view of destination camera 2 distinguish moving from stationary vehicles 3 identify a time at which a moving vehicle becomes stationary in an area of the field of view corresponding to a destination location 4 identify which destination location s each stationary vehicle is occupying 5 keep track of how long each vehicle has occupied its respective destination location s 6 identify a time at which a stationary vehicle vacates an area of the field of view corresponding to a destination location 7 determine when use of a destination location conflicts with restrictions established for the destination location 8 identify which street or block a vehicle is improperly parked 9 track an amount of time each vehicle has been improperly parked and 10 track a time at which a vehicle ceases to be illegally parked. Various types of destination locations each having respective restrictions for wheeled motor vehicles include but are not limited to no parking areas anytime fire lane fire hydrant no parking during specified times and or days for example during rush hour or street cleaning no parking stopping standing limited time parking for example 2 hour time limit parking restricted to classes of vehicles taxi stand bus stop loading zone commercial vehicles only permitted parking handicapped or resident only parking pick up and drop off only locations and street intersections for anti gridlock block the box moving violations in which a vehicle remains within an intersection during a red light for the vehicle s direction of travel . Server system may be configured to detect other parking violations such as but not limited to parking within a specified distance of an intersection parking in a bike lane or crosswalk or other pedestrian zone not within a space for a single destination location more than a specified distance from a curb parking in or in front of a driveway use of an island or center strip vehicle parked facing the wrong direction abandoned vehicle stationary for more than a specified number of days oversize vehicles incorrect class of vehicle such as a camper trailer or boat for more than a specified number of hours in a given number of days . A destination location may also be subject to a reservation where an end user reserves exclusive use of a destination location for a specified period of time. Server system may also be configured to detect double parked vehicles while distinguishing vehicles stopping in traffic lanes due to driving conditions from improperly double parked vehicles. Server system may also be configured to recognize and in some cases distinguish smaller wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles scooters and smart cars. 

In the second task the vehicle is tracked as it moves across the field of view of destination camera . There is overlap between an image captured by destination camera and a neighboring identification or destination camera such that a vehicle is within the field of vision of both cameras for a minimum of 2 seconds at a speed of 15 MPH approximately 44 feet . In general neighboring camera positions are determined to ensure this overlap occurs. As the two cameras have uniquely different angles of view obtaining overlapped images of any given vehicle from both of these cameras is treated as a positive identification of the vehicle via license plate number obtained from the identification image along with the exact parking space the vehicle has occupied in the event the vehicle parks .

In some configurations a destination camera may be positioned to monitor vehicle movement in a particular area where the area does not include any destination locations of interest to server system . Such an area may be located for example between two areas each containing destination locations of interest. In this example images captured by the destination camera may overlap images captured by cameras corresponding to these two areas and can be used for a handoff procedure as illustrated in discussed below.

In an embodiment destination camera may have pan tilt and or zoom capability which may be used for server system to obtain a more detailed view of a destination location or may be used by parking facility operator personnel via a user interface on parking operation system to monitor particular areas of interest viewable by destination camera . In such an embodiment server system may be configured to perform a coordinate transformation in order to monitor usage of destination locations and accurately determine vehicle characteristics while varying the field of view of destination camera .

In an embodiment preliminary motion detection may be used to reduce the number of destination images which are captured and or analyzed as there may be significant periods of time during which no vehicles pass through the field of view of destination camera .

In an embodiment accurate date and time stamps are included in all images captured by identification cameras and destination cameras to facilitate later manual review of stored images should such a need arise.

In an embodiment some amount of grace period is given to vehicles after they are determined to have become stationary within an appropriate destination location in contrast to an inappropriate destination location such as a no parking zone . When a driver leaves the vehicle to pay for parking even though it has been determined that the vehicle has begun use of a destination location with no payment made some grace period is needed to delay the determination that the vehicle is in violation of a paid use requirement since some amount of time is required to complete the payment process.

At time t the identification camera captures another identification image of vehicle at the location designated . At approximately time t a first destination camera captures destination image of vehicle within overlap area for example at approximately the location . In some embodiments the identification camera and the first destination camera are synchronized such that images and are both captured at essentially the same time t. Overlap area corresponds to the field of view of identification image which overlaps the field of view of destination image . In both images and images of vehicle have been captured while vehicle is within overlap area

Based on one or more identification images captured by the identification camera such as identification image server system determines a plurality of characteristics Ca for vehicle . As noted above fixed characteristics for vehicle and recorded in database may be included in Ca. Examples of the characteristics include but are not limited to a speed of travel for vehicle a direction of travel for vehicle a position of a vehicle in a vehicle image including for example a lane of traffic vehicle is traveling in a color of vehicle and a size or dimension of vehicle . Some characteristics may be considered static characteristics of vehicle and are not expected to change over time for example vehicle color or size . Other characteristics may be considered dynamic characteristics of vehicle and may change significantly over time for example vehicle speed or lane of travel . In an embodiment static characteristics may be recorded in database as fixed characteristics of vehicle in connection with the unique identifier determined based on identification image . These fixed characteristics may be determined based on vehicle information provided by an end user such as make model year and color or they may be based on vehicle images captured during a previous encounter between vehicle and server system . The fixed characteristics may be used in connection with determining a unique identifier for vehicle by ensuring that static characteristics determined from identification images correspond to the fixed characteristics. The fixed characteristics may also be included in Ca or other pluralities of characteristics where a vehicle identification has been confirmed. Based on destination image and possibly other destination images captured by the first destination camera server system determines a plurality of characteristics Ca for vehicle . Due to factors such as the different angles of view of vehicle for the identification camera and the first destination camera and obstructing vehicles Ca and Ca may consist of different but typically overlapping sets of vehicle characteristics. For example a vehicle width may be determined for Ca but not Ca due to a partial obstruction of vehicle from the point of view of the first destination camera around time t. Additionally image distortion which is typically more significant at the borders or images or other factors may result in some vehicle characteristics such as speed or size only being approximate values. Normalization of characteristics such as size speed and direction of travel may be performed to compensate for camera positioning and zoom level.

Server system then determines whether Ca corresponds to Ca by comparing the values of the vehicle characteristics included in both Ca and Ca . As vehicle characteristics determined by server system may be approximations of the actual characteristics of vehicle an approximate equivalence between values where such equivalence is demonstrated for all of the compared characteristics is sufficient to support a determination that Ca corresponds to Ca. If Ca is determined to correspond to Ca then server system records in database in connection with the unique identifier that vehicle was observed by the first destination camera at time t. In an alternative embodiment server system instead stores in volatile memory that vehicle was observed by the first destination camera at time t and such information is recorded in database after a determination that vehicle has made use of a destination location prior to vehicle being identified by server system via identification images obtained from an identification camera other than the identification camera which captured identification image . This avoids writing vehicle location information to database that is not required to demonstrate that a use of a particular destination location by vehicle .

At time t the first destination camera captures another destination image of vehicle at the location designated . At approximately time t a second destination camera captures destination image of vehicle within overlap area for example at approximately the location . In some embodiments the first destination camera and the second destination camera are synchronized such that images and are both captured at essentially the same time t. Overlap area corresponds to the field of view of destination image which overlaps the field of view of destination image . In both images and images of vehicles and have been captured while vehicles and are within overlap area

Based on one or more destination images captured by the first destination camera such as identification image server system determines a plurality of characteristics Cb for vehicle . As noted above fixed characteristics for vehicle and recorded in database may be included in Cb. Based on destination image and possibly other destination images captured by the second destination camera server system determines a plurality of characteristics Cb for vehicle . Additionally due to the inclusion of vehicle in destination image a plurality of vehicle characteristics Cx are determined for vehicle . Differences in dynamic vehicle characteristics between Cb and Cx would result due to vehicle traveling in the opposite direction in a different lane of travel. Server system then determines whether Cx corresponds to Cb which should not occur. Server system then determines whether Cb corresponds to Cb. If Cb is determined to correspond to Cb then server system records in database in connection with the unique identifier that vehicle was observed by the second destination camera at time t. In an alternative embodiment server system instead stores in volatile memory that vehicle was observed by the second destination camera at time t and such information is recorded in database after a determination that vehicle has made use of a destination location prior to vehicle being identified by server system via identification images obtained from an identification camera other than the identification camera which captured identification image .

At time t the second destination camera captures another destination image of vehicle at the location designated . At approximately time t a third destination camera captures destination image of vehicle within overlap area for example at approximately the location . In some embodiments the second destination camera and the third destination camera are synchronized such that images and are both captured at essentially the same time t. Overlap area corresponds to the field of view of destination image which overlaps the field of view of destination image . In both images and images of vehicle have been captured while vehicle is within overlap area

Based on one or more destination images captured by the second destination camera such as identification image server system determines a plurality of characteristics Cc for vehicle . As noted above fixed characteristics for vehicle and recorded in database may be included in Cc. Based on destination image and possibly other destination images captured by the third destination camera server system determines a plurality of characteristics Cc for vehicle . Server system then determines whether Cc corresponds to Cc. If Cc is determined to correspond to Cc then server system records in database in connection with the unique identifier that vehicle was observed by the third destination camera at time t. In an alternative embodiment server system instead stores in volatile memory that vehicle was observed by the third destination camera at time t and such information is recorded in database after a determination that vehicle has made use of a destination location prior to vehicle being identified by server system via identification images obtained from an identification camera other than the identification camera which captured identification image . In an embodiment a second identification camera may be responsible for capturing image but is unable to obtain an image of a license plate for vehicle in which case characteristics of vehicle observed via the second identification camera are used to confirm that the vehicle observed in overlap area around area is vehicle . This illustrates that it is not significant whether it is a destination camera or an identification camera which is used for tracking vehicle as it moves away from the initial identification camera. When used in connection with such tracking these cameras may be broadly referred to as tracking cameras. 

At time t the third destination camera captures another destination image of vehicle at the location designated . At approximately time t a fourth destination camera captures destination image of vehicle within overlap area for example at approximately the location . In some embodiments the third destination camera and the fourth destination camera are synchronized such that images and are both captured at essentially the same time t. Overlap area corresponds to the field of view of destination image which overlaps the field of view of destination image . In both images and images of vehicle have been captured while vehicle is within overlap area

Based on one or more destination images captured by the third destination camera such as identification image server system determines a plurality of characteristics Cd for vehicle . As noted above fixed characteristics for vehicle and recorded in database may be included in Cd. Based on destination image and possibly other destination images captured by the fourth destination camera server system determines a plurality of characteristics Cd for vehicle . Server system then determines whether Cd corresponds to Cd. If Cd is determined to correspond to Cd then server system records in database in connection with the unique identifier that vehicle was observed by the fourth destination camera at time t. In an alternative embodiment server system instead stores in volatile memory that vehicle was observed by the fourth destination camera at time t and such information is recorded in database after a determination that vehicle has made use of a destination location prior to vehicle being identified by server system via identification images obtained from an identification camera other than the identification camera which captured identification image .

In association with the field of view for image illustrated in four appropriate destination locations to such as parking spots with a hourly rate for use have been specified to server system . At time t destination image is captured by the fourth destination camera at a time when vehicle is at location . Based on destination image server system determines that vehicle is within the rectangular region specified for destination location . At time t destination image is captured by the fourth destination camera with vehicle remaining at location . Based on destination image server system again determines that vehicle is within the rectangular region specified for destination location accordingly determines that vehicle began use of destination location beginning at time t and records this information in database . At time t destination image is captured by the fourth destination camera at a time when vehicle has exited destination location . Based on destination image server system determines that vehicle is no longer within the rectangular region specified for destination location accordingly determines that vehicle completed its use of destination location at time t. Based on information as to restrictions applicable to use of destination location from the time period t to t such as for example an hourly rate for use of the destination location server system can initiate actions such as billing an end user account for this use of destination location or such as levying a fine for improper use of destination location

Server system is also configured to correctly identify a vehicle which has made use of a destination location where server system first determines that a vehicle has made use of a destination location and then later is able to capture a vehicle identification via an identification camera. This situation may occur where for example a view of a vehicle is obstructed as it passes by an identification camera or a restart of server system results an identification of the vehicle not being made previously. As an example if at time t before time t the fourth destination camera were to first determine that vehicle was making use of destination location but not have an identification for vehicle a temporary unique identifier would be assigned to vehicle and entries recorded in database in connection with the temporary identifier. Sets of vehicle characteristics would be determined for vehicle while it made use of destination location as well as when it passed through overlap areas and and the correspondence of these sets of characteristics would be performed much in the same manner described above to determine and record that the same vehicle associated with the temporary identifier was still being observed. Once observed by the first identification camera while located in overlap area server system would be able to determine a correct unique identifier for vehicle . At that point records previously recorded in database under the temporary identifier can be modified or stored again under the correct unique identifier for vehicle which the use of destination location properly associated with that identifier. An alternative mechanism for obtaining an identification of vehicle after time t is to dispatch mobile device to capture one or more identification images of vehicle while it is making use of destination location . Dispatch of mobile device may be designated a higher priority where the use of destination location by vehicle is determined to conflict with restrictions associated with use of destination location

Server system receives images from the identification and destination cameras and interpolates the identities of parked vehicles. Server system may then retrieve parking payment information such as but not limited to duration of paid parking and time of expiration from a third party parking payment system via an API application programming interface . If a vehicle parking status is determined to be either unpaid or expired the server system transmits this information to the third party parking payment system via an API. The parking facility operator which runs the third party payment system can then follows its Standard Operating Procedures SOP in dealing with parking violations such as but not limited to mailing a parking violation ticket installing a wheel clamp on the vehicle or towing the vehicle upon repeated or severe parking violations .

Vehicle detection by server system may be configured to perform several functions 1 detecting the presence and location of vehicles in video frames 2 distinguishing moving vehicles from stationary vehicles 3 identifying whether particular detected vehicles are occupying destination locations such as parking spaces or no parking areas 4 determine a time at which a vehicle begins to occupy or vacates a destination location 5 track vehicles as they travel from the field of view of one tracking camera to another and raise an exception if an error in this tracking is determined to have occurred. In an embodiment server system may also be configured to identify whether particular vehicles are displaying an appropriate indicator for access or use of a destination location. Examples of such indicators include but are not limited to a handicapped parking hanger or decal or a parking hanger or decal indicating authorized use of a resident only parking location. A camera may be zoomed in to more clearly capture images of such indicators. In an embodiment a vehicle identifier such as a license plate may be used to determine appropriate access or use of a destination location and obviate the need for a separate indicator.

In an example implementation server system may be programmed to use threads to carry out its tasks for identification and destination cameras. For example a video receiver thread may handle the reception of a video and or image stream from an identifier or destination camera and store raw video and or image information. This may be with one thread per video and or image stream or multiple video and or image streams. Configurable options for this thread may include 1 store to file 2 store to memory 3 store to memory and file 4 a retention time for video data for example 4 hours . Another example is a thread to detect vehicle color shape location lane position speed direction of travel whether a vehicle location is in a handoff zone and which one camera identification and storing such information in database . This thread would examine each multiple video frames to determine updated locations and speed direction of travel of vehicles and storing such information in database . There may be one thread per video and or image stream or multiple video and or image streams. Another example is a thread which confirms a particular vehicle detected as exiting via a handoff zone is detected by a nearby camera. This may be done for example by reviewing the database for a particular camera based on in which handoff zone the vehicle was detected and or a detected direction of travel for the vehicle. There may be one thread per video and or image stream or multiple video and or image streams. Another example is a thread to determine whether a vehicle is occupying a destination location by remaining stationary at that destination location along with a time when vehicle begins to occupy or vacates the destination location. There may be one thread per video and or image stream or multiple video and or image streams.

Many machine vision techniques are known in the art which may be used for detecting the presence of vehicles in video frames. For example there are various known edge detection algorithms which may be used for detecting the presence of vehicles. As an example an algorithm may detect the presence of a vehicle based on differences in color between the vehicle and the background and whether a size of a total shape is larger than a minimum vehicle size expected in consideration of zoom level and or location in a field of vision. For example the algorithm may compare colors of pixels in a video stream snapshot against each other. Since an image likely includes various non vehicle objects such as a fire hydrant pedestrian grass road markings and paint the algorithm may detect groups of pixels with similar colors with a configurable range of variation in color considered to be a match . The number and location of pixels in the total shape are used to determine whether the shape is larger than the minimum vehicle size. The algorithm may further accommodate holes or imperfections in the shape which may occur due to specular reflections or highlights for example. Additionally the algorithm may determine whether a number of shapes of respective minimum sizes are within certain distances of each other. These shapes may correspond to for example hood roof and trunk portions of a vehicle which are typically of the same color.

A boundary condition may occur where there is insufficient contrast or difference in color between a vehicle and the background in which detection may fail. For example a black vehicle against black asphalt. Further refinements to camera hardware and or the algorithm may be introduced to address this boundary condition. For example a camera that performs both visible light and thermal imaging may be used which obtains a heat signature of a vehicle that has begun occupying a destination location. In this example the engine compartment would have a different thermal profile than its surrounding even though both the vehicle and the backdrop are black in color. Further cost benefit analysis would determine whether the benefits gained from such an approach justifies the incremental cost as well as taking in account any boundary conditions caused by the thermal imaging process can be sufficiently addressed such as by the visible light captured by the camera .

Although the presence and many characteristics of a vehicle can be recognized from a single image multiple images are needed and used to determine for example if the vehicle is stationary or moving. In an example server system may be configured to 1 based on determinations of color and size of vehicles in the current image find corresponding matches in previous images for example by reviewing data stored in database or memory and 2 once such matches are found compare the locations of pixels between the current image and previous images taking into account any change in zoom level. Based on such processing one or more of the following scenarios may be detected. A if locations of pixels are unchanged or have unchanged below a predetermined threshold all vehicles are deemed to have remained stationary. In this scenario a simple update of the date and time is performed for existing entries in database or memory for the vehicles. B if pixels associated with one or more vehicles are at new locations then the one or more vehicles are determined to have moved. Server system may calculate speed and direction of travel for these vehicles and update database or memory with this information along with updated locations. C if one or more vehicles have disappeared from the current image server system may be configured to remove data recorded in database or memory for such vehicles. D if one or more vehicles have newly appeared in the current image data associated with the new vehicles may be recorded in database or memory. In an embodiment server system may determine that one of the new vehicles corresponds to a vehicle recently determined to have disappeared and may treat the view of the vehicle as having been temporarily obstructed. E if all vehicles have disappeared from the current image data from database or memory from the preceding interval may be removed in connection with the vehicles therein. However some data may be retained in order to perform vehicle tracking to or from an identification camera as discussed previously.

In an example an algorithm for identifying which vehicles are occupying destination areas is similar to the basic vehicle detection algorithm. Once vehicle detection is completed server system evaluates whether pixel locations corresponding to a vehicle occupy any of the pre mapped visual regions. A degree of overlap may be configurable. In an embodiment a vertical offset may be applied to compensate for vehicle height and compensate for a visual obstruction such as a parked vehicle between a destination camera and the vehicle. Such obstructions may frequently occur in dense parking lots for example. Also server system determines whether the vehicle has remained stationary for at least a certain amount of time. Once it is determined that a vehicle has dwelled in a given destination location for at least the certain amount of time identification information for the vehicle the destination location and a time and date at which the vehicle began to make use of the destination are recorded in database preferably in non volatile storage. In an embodiment server system may be configured to detect when a vehicle takes up multiple destination locations such as by occupying two parking spaces. This may result in for example issuance of one or more parking citations or increased usage fees. Server system may also determine when the vehicle vacates the destination location and record corresponding information in database . Also server system may be configured to determine when user of the destination location by the vehicle will soon exceed or has exceeded a period of time for use of the destination location such as may occur in connection with a parking spot with a two hour maximum parking duration a destination location not available for vehicle use after a specified time for street sweeping or the exhaustion of funds provided for the vehicle.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to recognize one or more multi vehicle destination locations which may be used by more than one vehicle at a time. For example server system may be configured to support tracking for long block parking of vehicles in which a parking area controlled by for example a single Pay by Space Pay and Display or Pay by Plate unit is provided along the length of a curb for a city block but the parking area is not divided into marked parking spaces instead vehicles can make use of any available space along the curb excluding certain no parking regions such as but not limited to loading zones and driveways . In another example server system may be configured to track use of a parking lot but not a plurality of individually marked spaces therein controlled by for example a single Pay and Display unit. Although server system may not be configured to track use of a multi vehicle destination location on a space by space basis server system may determine and record the position of a vehicle within the multi vehicle destination location for tracking the vehicle s use over time and for parking enforcement activities such as attaching a citation to a vehicle which has exceeded its permitted use of the multi vehicle destination location. In an embodiment server system may be configured to determine a length of a vehicle making use of a multi vehicle destination location as a greater parking fee and or fine may imposed for the use of space that otherwise could be occupied by more than one vehicle. One benefit of using the server system described in this application is that whereas conventional controlled parking lots might rely on a single point of ingress and egress for controlling use of the lot tracking by use of cameras allows for a parking lot with multiple entrances and exits and a more open design as vehicles do not need to be confined by wall of fencing.

In an embodiment multiple noncontiguous destination locations or multi vehicle destination locations may be aggregated into a single multi vehicle destination location. This may include where two constituent destination locations are covered by different destination cameras. This may be useful where for example a multi vehicle destination location is broken up by various no parking destination locations along the length of a city block.

In an embodiment there may be a restricted destination location such as a no parking overlaying a multi vehicle destination location so as to carve out restricted areas of the multi vehicle location. For example in the long block scenario discussed above a single multi vehicle destination location may be defined along the entire length of a city block with no parking destination locations overlaying various portions along the city block such as but no limited to loading zones and driveways along the length of the block. A vehicle detected by server system as making use of one of the no parking destination locations will be determined by server system as having committed a parking violation despite the vehicle also have been within the larger multi vehicle destination location.

In an embodiment a computer based configuration utility may be provided. For example mobile device or manual review system may be configured with a configuration utility allowing for on site or remote configuration. For example mobile device may be used by a person performing camera installation in order to provide feedback as to the effectiveness of a camera configuration for vehicle identification tracking and or detection. Alternatively or in addition certain system or camera configuration changes may be made via manual review system as a result of configuration shortcoming identified during use of manual review system . In an embodiment a user interface may be made available via a web browser. The configuration utility may provide one or more features such as but not limited to 

To perform calibration of vehicle detection for a given camera a GUI presents two image feeds and allows an administrator to superimpose rulers on each image feed. A zoom level if any may be displayed as part of the GUI as may be a control for modifying the zoom level. The two image feeds originate from the given camera and another camera with an overlapping field of vision such cameras are often adjacent to each other . Preferably for calibration the capture of images for the two cameras is synchronized such that images are captured at the same time allowing for review of a vehicle s position in each video feed such as when it passes through the overlapping area of the two cameras fields of vision. The configuration utility may also provide by way of the GUI temporal image control functions such as pause play rewind fast forward freeze frame advance freeze frame reverse and goto frame functions.

For calibration the configuration utility may be used to find one or more vehicles of known make and model in one or both image feeds this might include for example a vehicle used by a technician operating the configuration utility and position one or more rulers in the GUI such that the rulers indicate the correct length width and or height of the vehicles by reference to known values for these dimensions for the vehicles being measured. In an embodiment the ruler function provided by the GUI is configured to compensate for nonlinearities due to factors such as visual distortion introduced by the camera which may have known characteristics based on a camera model for example or the perspective of the captured image. For example ruler markings indicating units of distance may be spaced closer on a right hand side of an image where vehicles captured in that area are further away from the camera than those captured in the left hand side of the image. The configuration utility may be configured to allow for on site calibration of such nonlinearities for a given camera by identifying markers in an image and specifying positions and or distances relative to other markers and or the camera . Such markers may be temporarily or in some cases permanently for the purpose of later recalibration placed by a technician.

Also the configuration utility may be used to specify relationships between directions of travel in the two image feeds as well as identify pixels or image locations corresponding to common points in the two image feeds. In an embodiment locations and directions of travel may be specified for lanes paths of traffic in each of the image feeds and correlated between the two images feeds allowing for example later determination of when a vehicle passes from the field of one camera to another within the same lane path of traffic . Specification of these features may be done via the GUI for example by allowing for the overlay of lines or other indicators on the image feeds indicating lane path boundaries. illustrate aspects of an example GUI. illustrates a portion of the GUI in which an image from a first camera is displayed. illustrates a portion of the GUI in which an image from a second camera is displayed. The field of views of the images and overlap with the area of overlap including areas and . Also captured in images and are two lanes paths of traffic labeled as lanes paths and in and lanes paths and in . In this particular example illustrated in traffic proceeds in the same direction generally corresponding to angle in lanes paths and although in a similar example traffic might proceed in opposing directions in lanes paths and Also captured in images and are images of three vehicles respectively labeled A B and C. In lane path boundaries have been specified with the dashed lane path boundary indicators and which may be added placed moved labeled and otherwise identified by use of the GUI. In two traffic lanes paths have been specified using the GUI the lane path between lane path boundary indicators and and the lane path between lane path boundary indicators and . In the particular example illustrating in traffic proceeds in lanes paths and in the same direction and lane path boundary indicators and are of a first type illustrated by the similar dashed lines and lane path boundary indicator is of a second type indicating the division of the area of unidirectional traffic flow between lane path boundary indicators and into the two lanes paths and . The configuration utility may be configured to automatically provide or suggest identifiers for the specified lanes for cross referencing with for example lanes identified in connection with other cameras such as lanes paths and illustrated in . In the configuration utility provides similar facilities for lane path identification with lanes paths and and lane path boundary indicator lines and corresponding to their counterparts in described above.

In an embodiment each lane path of traffic may be divided into a number of smaller segments. These segments may be specified via the GUI for example by allowing for the overlay of lines or other indicators on the image feeds indicating the segments. In an embodiment the overlaid lines may be used to aid in automatically characterizing nonlinearities in image feeds. illustrates an example with lane path segment indicator and other similar unlabeled lane path segment indicators. The configuration utility may be configured to automatically generate suggested lane path segment indicators based on previously specified lane path boundary indicators and provide via the GUI tools for adjusting the lane path boundary indicators as desired. Also the inclusion of vehicle images such as vehicles A B and C shown in may aid a technician in accurately placing or adjusting lane path segment indicators. illustrates lane path segment indicator and other similar unlabeled lane path segment indicators corresponding to their counterpart in described above.

The configuration utility may also provide similar features via the GUI for specifying an area of an image stream with an overlapping field of view with a respective area of a second image stream. As these areas are used for handing off the detection of a vehicle from one tracking camera to another these areas may be referred to as handoff zones. For example illustrate images captured by cameras with overlapping fields of view in which the field of view for handoff zone overlaps the field of view for handoff zone . The GUI may be configured to allow for specification of handoff border indicators and in and respective handoff border indicators and in . Also a specified handoff zone may be divided into a number of smaller segments using handoff segment indicators and and other unlabeled handoff segment indicators illustrated in . The configuration utility may be configured to automatically generate suggested handoff segment indicators based on previously specified handoff boundary indicators and provide via the GUI tools for adjusting the handoff boundary indicators as desired. Also the inclusion of vehicle images such as vehicles A B and C shown in may aid a technician in accurately placing or adjusting handoff segment indicators. In an embodiment the configuration utility may be configured to determine a distance between handoff border indicators and an alert a user of the GUI if this distance is below a minimum desired distance.

Although the GUI illustrated in shows and describes indicators provided by the GUI as simple lines the configuration utility and the GUI may also provide for specifying features with more complex shapes such as but not limited to curves and freehand lines. Also where an indicator specified in connection with a first camera such as lane path boundary indicator has a counterpart indicator in connection with another camera such as lane path boundary indicator these counterpart indicators may be linked using the GUI. In an embodiment such links may be automatically determined or suggested based on information such as previously specified indicators a known position of a camera a known orientation of the camera and known aspects of traffic flow proximate to a camera such as numbers of lanes paths and directions of traffic flow within those lanes paths.

In an embodiment where a camera provides for zoom and or pan tilt capabilities the configuration utility may be configured to allow for the specification of various indicator features in images captured with the camera at various zoom levels or orientations. This additional information may be used to more fully specify the overall field of view of the camera. Once a technician is satisfied with how indicators and or rulers have been used to specify the field of view of a camera this information and or other information derived therefrom may be stored in database for use in for example vehicle tracking by server system .

The configuration utility may be configured to provide a GUI to perform contiguous video camera alignment. This functionality may be provided via additional user interface elements included in the above described GUI for specifying lane path boundaries. Contiguous video camera alignment refers to the fact that during an initial camera hardware installation process or if existing camera hardware is later updated if the camera is equipped with pan tilt and or zoom PTZ function the pan tilt and or zoom settings of the camera need to be adjusted and or calibrated to ensure there is sufficient overlap in the field of vision between cameras such as the overlap illustrated in A and B. A technician can review the GUI to determine whether a handoff zone of sufficient size and or duration is provided by a pair of cameras. If not pan tilt and or zoom settings may require changes or the physical installation location of a camera may need to be changed altogether.

The configuration utility may be configured to provide a GUI to perform pre mapping of destination locations such as parking spaces and no parking zones. The GUI presents an image feed and allows a technician to superimpose grayed out polygons for example on an image feed. In another nonlimiting example a parking spot 123 might be mapped to a collection of 20 pixels as captured by a particular destination camera at a given zoom level and or PTZ orientation. The GUI may be configured to provide operations for including but not limited to moving resizing and rotating such polygons to indicate the position and extent of destination locations within a field of view of a camera. Where a camera has PTZ capabilities PTZ controls may be provided. This functionality may be provided via additional user interface elements included in the above described GUI for specifying lane path boundaries. The GUI may also provide an interface of assigning an identifier to a destination location which may be used for example to provide a common identifier for the destination location for use by various aspects of server system . The GUI may also provide interface elements allowing for various characteristics of a destination location to be specified although it may be preferable to employ other aspects of the configuration utility or server system to manage assign and or modify such characteristics with minimal direct human operation.

In an embodiment the configuration utility may be configured to provide a GUI to perform pre mapping of multi vehicle destination locations discussed above in much the same manner as the above description for pre mapping single vehicle destination locations. The configuration utility may be configured to allow multiple destination locations or multi vehicle destination locations to be aggregated into a single destination location. For example each of the constituent destination locations might be assigned a common identifier to indicate they form a multi vehicle destination location. The configuration utility may be configured to allow restricted destination locations to be overlaid a multi vehicle destination location to carve out portions of a broad area subject to parking restrictions such as but not limited to loading zones and driveways.

The configuration utility may be configured to provide a GUI for specifying what constitutes a parking violation. In a first example a grace period duration may be specified with the GUI which defines an amount of time a vehicle may occupy a destination location before the vehicle may be considered to be in violation of restrictions on use of the destination location. For example when a vehicle stops at a parking meter it is reasonable to provide a grace period sufficient for the driver of the vehicle to leave the vehicle and pay for parking. Differing periods of time may be specified for different types or groups of destination locations for example a no parking zone may have a small or zero grace period. In a second example an amount of vehicle overlap may be specified with the GUI as to how much in terms of square footage or percent area coverage a vehicle overlaps a destination location before the vehicle may be considered to be in violation. In a third example permit parking rules may be specified with the GUI including rules in connection with for example the use of handicap parking spaces resident only parking or other parking requiring the display of a permit or decal. The GUI may also provide an interface for identifying characteristics and features of a required permit or decal such as but not limited to color an image featured on the permit or decal and a location of an identifier such as a serial number for the permit or decal. In a fourth example a GUI may be configured to define rules for determining what constitutes an expired license plate tag such as whether a tag indicating the current month is considered to have expired.

The configuration utility may be configured to provide a GUI for specifying consequences for vehicle misuse of a destination location. Examples include but are not limited to on screen display of license plate information license plate lookup to obtain the name and address of a registered owner dispatching an enforcement officer provide a laser based illumination of a vehicle misusing a destination location applying a parking fine to a credit card or account on file and deducting a parking fine from a checking or other monetary account.

The configuration utility may be configured to receive and record parameters specifying certain vehicles for which outcomes of detected parking violations would be modified for example a police vehicle may be identified as exempt from specified violations . For example such vehicles may be identified by license plate number or bear a specified identifier such as a decal.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to obtain preexisting street and or parking information which may be obtained through a commercial or municipal database and or provided by a parking operator and automatically determining destination and traffic lane path information In an embodiment based on information indicating the location and orientation of the various identification and destination cameras server system may be configured to automatically pre map destination locations and or traffic lanes paths. In an embodiment server system may be configured to record and or update characteristics for destination locations and or traffic lanes paths recorded in database such as but not limited to identifiers locations for example latitude longitude or street address rates for use of destination locations and time based date based and other restrictions for destination locations described in this application. In an embodiment server system may provide an API to more easily allow a parking provider to upload destination location information and or updates in bulk.

In an alternative embodiment server system and other elements illustrated in are in the form of a turnkey platform where no integration with third party parking payment systems via an API is required. In such an embodiment part of the turnkey platform consists of payment stations equipment and equipment that generates parking violation tickets for mailing.

In an embodiment onsite payment system may include a turnkey platform Pay by Phone feature. The end result is that end users can pay for parking by calling a particular IVR interactive voice response system driven phone line and input a destination location identifier or vehicle license plate number and a duration of parking regardless of whether a destination location is associated with a curbside parking meter a Pay by Space parking space or a parking lot.

The turnkey Pay by Phone module enables end users to pay for parking by use of a telephone typically cellular phone. The turnkey Pay by Phone machine enables database level integration with server system . Database level integration is superior to API level integration since database level integration offers more flexibility and speed.

The turnkey Pay by Phone module receives data from one or more DTMF transceivers where users enter information over the telephone. There is no requirement for the turnkey Pay by Phone module to receive data from server system in order for the turnkey Pay by Phone module to operate correctly. The turnkey Pay by Phone module may be configured to output data to mobile device for manual paid parking validation as well as to server system for self enforcement. All self enforcement data processing takes place on server system .

In an embodiment onsite payment system may include Pay Online on a turnkey platform. The end result is that end users can pay for parking or view prior history by visiting a website and enter a destination location identifier or vehicle license plate number and the duration of parking regardless of whether a destination location is associated with a curbside parking meter a Pay by Space parking space or a parking lot. This extends to other online conduits such as smart phones and in the future Internet enabled media centers in cars.

The turnkey Pay Online module receives data online where end users enter information over the Internet. There is no requirement for the turnkey Pay Online module to receive data from server system in order for the turnkey Pay Online module to operate correctly. The turnkey Pay Online module outputs data to the mobile device for manual paid parking validation as well as to the server system for self enforcement. All self enforcement data processing takes place on server system .

In an embodiment onsite payment system may include a Pay and Display machine with QR codes. QR codes have become popular and accordingly have significant smartphone support. Further QR codes can easily hold all of the relevant information typically contained on a Pay and Display ticket such as but not limited to parking duration parking expiration time amount paid date and time . The turnkey Pay and Display machine allows end users to pay for parking and leave a display ticket with a QR code on the dash of the vehicle. The turnkey Pay and Display machine enables database level integration with server system . Database level integration is superior to API level integration since database level integration offers more flexibility and speed.

The turnkey Pay and Display machine receives payment from end users via a built in keypad coin acceptor credit card reader and printer. There is also a text graphics LCD display. There is no requirement for the turnkey Pay and Display machine to receive data from server system in order for the turnkey Pay and Display machine to operate correctly. The turnkey Pay and Display machine outputs data to mobile device for manual paid parking validation as well as to server system for self enforcement. All self enforcement data processing takes place on server system .

In an embodiment onsite payment system may include a Pay by Space turnkey machine. Pay by Space is increasingly becoming popular compared to Pay and Display which has a longer history of operation. Parking operations using Pay by Space are generally more efficient since parking enforcement personnel no longer have to walk to each vehicle and lean into the windshield in order to manually check the printed expiration time. Instead they can drive in a patrol vehicle and perform visual checks from a distance to see whether an occupied parking space has been paid for. In addition Pay by Space offers enhanced user experience since drivers no longer have to walk back to their vehicles to display the ticket after paying at the machine instead they can continue on to their destination.

Integration with third party parking systems is an option rather than a requirement for server system . In a turnkey configuration where the entire parking equipment platform is provided for example through a single supplier no integration with third party parking systems is required. However there are many advantages to the integration approach using API. An API provides a standard software programming interface designed to allow an external program to gain access to information in a host system without exposing any trade secrets of the host system. This is achieved by creating clearly defined functions objects and variables at the boundary of the two systems such that the external system is allowed to obtain pre defined set of information without any knowledge of how the information is gathered stored or calculated within the host system itself. As such companies generally have no reservations with publishing API for other systems to interface to its products or servers. Data may be exchanged via an API via network based mechanisms often protected by encryption mechanisms such as SSL relying on XML JSON HTML MIME or other encodings or languages supported by the API.

There are two ways for server system to integrate with an API. First by using an API published by the third party parking system server system can gain access to vehicle payment information such as but not limited to duration paid and space number . Combined with the vehicle detection and vehicle identity information server system already possesses server system has or can readily obtain the complete information necessary to produce a list of vehicle license plates with detailed parking violation information to a parking facility operator. The parking facility operator can then follow its SOP and mail parking violation tickets install wheel clamps or tow repeat or severe offenders.

The second integration method is for server system to publish its own API so third party parking systems can obtain information on vehicle detection and vehicle identity. Combined with the vehicle payment information already possessed by the third party parking system the third party parking system can then provide a seamless presentation to the parking operator including a list of vehicle license plates with detailed parking violation information. The third party parking system provider may prefer this approach in order to retain control over how the parking violation information flows back to the parking operator.

By use of APIs server system can integrate with the following types of parking payment systems Pay by Phone Pay by Space Pay and Display Curbside Parking Meters single or double space and Live Operator Option.

The basic premise of Pay by Phone is an end user such as a driver of a vehicle calls a phone number displayed in the vicinity of a destination location. Typically the phone number offers IVR interactive voice response which guides callers through an automated menu. The end user is prompted to input a unique destination location number followed by parking duration desired vehicle license plate number and credit card information.

Pay by Phone is starting to gain traction as a popular overlay payment approach where parking facility operators add Pay by Phone capability to curbside parking meters Pay by Space and Pay and Display machines. The typical motivation is to provide end users an alternate way of paying for parking in an effort to increase parking revenue. For example Pay by Phone may be added to traditional curbside parking meters single or double space in order to allow end users to pay with credit cards over the phone.

In an embodiment server system may include a Pay by Phone integration module which may be a software component that extracts parking payment information from a third party parking payment system which server system uses for parking self enforcement. The integration module for pay by phone performs steps including 1 establishing a connection with a third party Pay by Phone API 2 issuing a request for data 3 receiving data 4 processing and storing data to database 5 determining parking violation status 6 marking use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic 7 periodic confirmation that the third party Pay by Phone API is active and valid such as but not limited to by use of keep alive ping messages or commands and 8 repeating steps 2 7 or closing the connection. In connection with step 1 an API typically specifies the mechanism through which a connection to it can be established. The Pay by Phone integration module is configured to observe the protocol required by the third party Pay by Phone API and establishes a connection.

In connection with step 2 when server system determines that a particular vehicle has vacated a destination location server system signals this event to the Pay by Phone integration module such as via a database or Inter Process Communication IPC call in response to which the Pay by Phone integration module issues a request to the third party Pay by Phone API for parking payment information for the particular vehicle. Data sent to the third party Pay by Phone API may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information an identifier for the destination location recognized by the Pay by Phone API which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system and a date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

In connection with step 3 the Pay by Phone integration module may be configured to receive information from the third party Pay by Phone API including for example a paid parking start date time and a paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 the Pay by Phone integration module may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

In an embodiment in which an API provided by server system is used for integration the Pay by Phone system will obtain only the vehicle detection information actual vehicle parking start and end times from server system since typically vehicle license plate information is already possessed by the Pay by Phone system. The end result is the Pay by Phone system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

Typically when a Pay by Phone system or its staff is agreeable to using the API provided by server system the Pay by Phone system or its staff is prepared to undertake some degree of custom software development generally for the purpose of receiving some useful data from server system . In this particular case the useful data is actual vehicle parking duration indicating an actual amount of time a particular vehicle has occupied a specific destination location for a particular vehicle license plate number or destination location number. In general Pay by Phone systems already have the vehicle license plate number or destination location number as they are generally obtained as part of the end user payment process.

Integration via a Pay by Phone API provided by server system may be according to one of two options. First is a data inflow model in which the third party parking payment system pushes information into server system . Second is a data outflow model in which server system pushes all relevant information to the Pay by Phone system.

In an embodiment server system may include an inflow based Pay by Phone API for use by a third party parking payment system via for example network in which the third party parking payment system pushes information into server system via the inflow based Pay by Phone API. The inflow based Pay by Phone API may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 receiving data from the third party parking payment system 4 processing and storing data to database 5 determining parking violation status 6 marking use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic 7 periodic confirmation that the inflow based Pay by Phone API is active and valid such as but not limited to by use of keep alive ping messages or commands and 8 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout. In connection with step 1 this may involve listening on a TCP or UDP port for the third party parking payment system to establish the connection. In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the inflow based Pay by Phone API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the inflow based Pay by Phone API receive vehicle parking information from the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle driver pays for parking. The received information for a particular vehicle may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information an identifier for a destination location for which payment was received in connection with the particular vehicle which may require translation to an identifier used internally by server system a paid parking start date time and paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 a Pay by Phone integration module included in server system may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

In an embodiment server system may include an outflow based Pay by Phone API for use by a third party parking payment system via for example network in which server system pushes all relevant information to the third party Pay by Phone system. The outflow based Pay by Phone API may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 uploading data to the third party parking payment system 4 receiving an acknowledgement for the uploaded data 5 responding to keep alive ping requests from the third party parking payment system and 6 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout. In connection with step 1 this may involve listening on a TCP or UDP port for the third party parking payment system to establish the connection. In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the outflow based Pay by Phone API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the outflow based Pay by Phone API upload vehicle parking information to the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle vacates a destination location associated with the third party parking payment system. The uploaded information for a particular vehicle may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information an identifier for the destination location recognized by the third party parking payment system which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system an actual date time the particular vehicle began use of the destination location and an actual date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

In another embodiment integration between a Pay by Phone system and server system takes place in two steps. First server system obtains vehicle payment information from the Pay by Phone system such as paid parking start and end times parking space number vehicle license plate number by using the Pay by Phone system provided API. At this stage the server system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details. However instead of server system presenting this list to a parking operator there may be instances where an incumbent parking payment vendor wishes to retain control over how the parking violation information flows back to the parking operator. This can be accomplished by sending the vehicle violation data back to the Pay by Phone system by using the API provided by server system . The Pay by Phone system will then have total control over how the list of offending vehicles is presented to the parking operator for example by way of a custom software application developed by the Pay by Phone system vendor .

A significant difference between this integration method and only relying on integration via the API provided by server system is that this integration method requires minimal development effort on the part of the Pay by Phone system vendor. Since all the key information to be presented to the parking operator is already supplied by the API provided by server system without any further analysis required this information can simply be displayed or forwarded to the parking operator with minimal software development. This integration approach represents a pull followed by a push model.

The premise of Pay by Space is that once an end user parks a vehicle the end user notes the space number of the parking spot. When the end user pays for parking at a Pay by Space machine the end user enters a stall number followed by parking duration desired. Once the payment is complete the end user does not need to leave a ticket in the vehicle instead the end user can simply continue on to wherever they are going. Pay by Space works equally well for both on street curbside parking and off street parking lots parking garages.

Pay by Space is increasingly becoming popular compared to Pay and Display which has a longer history of operation. Parking operations using Pay by Space are generally more efficient since parking enforcement personnel no longer have to walk to each vehicle and lean into the windshield in order to manually check a printed expiration time. Instead they can drive in a patrol vehicle and perform visual checks from a distance to see whether an occupied parking space has been paid for. In addition Pay by Space offers enhanced an user experience since end users no longer have to walk back to their vehicles to display the ticket after paying at the machine instead they can continue on to their destination.

Similar to the above described Pay by Phone integration can be accomplished by using either a Pay by Space system provided API or an API provided by server system . The objective is for either system to gain access to all the information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation information.

In an embodiment in which server system is integrated via a Pay by Space system provided API server system obtains vehicle payment information from the Pay by Space system such as paid parking start and end times destination location number and vehicle license plate number . The end result is server system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

In an embodiment server system may include a Pay by Space integration module which may be a software component that extracts parking payment information from a third party parking payment system which server system uses for parking self enforcement. The integration module for pay by space performs steps including 1 establishing a connection with a third party Pay by Space API 2 issuing a request for data 3 receiving data 4 processing and storing data to database 5 determining parking violation status 6 marking use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic 7 periodic confirmation that the third party Pay by Space API is active and valid such as but not limited to by use of keep alive ping messages or commands and 8 repeating steps 2 7 or closing the connection. In connection with step 1 an API typically specifies the mechanism through which a connection to it can be established. The Pay by Space integration module is configured to observe the protocol required by the third party Pay by Space API and establishes a connection.

In connection with step 2 when server system determines that a particular vehicle has vacated a destination location server system signals this event to the Pay by Space integration module such as via a database or Inter Process Communication IPC call in response to which the Pay by Space integration module issues a request to the third party Pay by Space API for parking payment information for the particular vehicle. Data sent to the third party Pay by Space API may include for example an identifier for the destination location recognized by the Pay by Space API which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system and a date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

In connection with step 3 the Pay by Space integration module may be configured to receive information from the third party Pay by Space API including for example a paid parking start date time and a paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 the Pay by Space integration module may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

In an embodiment in which server system is integrated with a Pay by Space system via an API provided by server system server system transmits vehicle information to the Pay by Space system such as vehicle license plate number destination location and actual parking start and end times . The end result is the Pay by Space system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

Typically when a Pay by Space system or its staff is agreeable to using the API provided by server system the Pay by Space system or its staff is prepared to undertake some degree of custom software development generally for the purpose of receiving some useful data from server system . In this particular case the useful data is actual vehicle parking duration an actual amount of time a particular vehicle has occupied a specific destination location for a particular vehicle license plate number or space number. In general Pay by Space systems already have the vehicle license plate number or space number as this may be obtained as part of the end user payment process.

Integration via a Pay by Space API provided by server system may be according to one of two options. First is a data inflow model in which the third party parking payment system pushes information into server system . Second is a data outflow model in which server system pushes all relevant information to the third party Pay by Space system.

In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the inflow based Pay by Space API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the inflow based Pay by Space API receive vehicle parking information from the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle driver pays for parking. The received information for a particular vehicle may include for example an identifier for a destination location for which payment was received in connection with the particular vehicle which may require translation to an identifier used internally by server system a paid parking start date time and paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 a Pay by Space integration module included in server system may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

In an embodiment server system may include an outflow based Pay by Space API for use by a third party parking payment system via for example network in which server system pushes all relevant information to the third party Pay by Space system. The outflow based Pay by Space API may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 uploading data to the third party parking payment system 4 receiving an acknowledgement for the uploaded data 5 responding to keep alive ping requests from the third party parking payment system and 6 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout.

In another embodiment server system is configured to integrate with a Pay by Space system in two steps. First server system obtains vehicle payment information from the Pay by Space system for example paid parking start and end times parking space number vehicle license plate number by using a Pay by Space system provided API. At this stage server system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details. However instead of server system presenting this list to the parking operator there may be instances where an incumbent parking payment vendor wishes to retain control over how the parking violation information flows back to the parking operator. This can be accomplished by sending the vehicle violation data back to the Pay by Space system by using the API provided by server system . The Pay by Space system will then have total control over how the list of offending vehicles is presented to the parking operator such as by way of a custom software application developed by the Pay by Space system vendor .

A significant difference between this integration method and integration with the Pay by Space system via the API provided by server system is that this integration method requires minimal development effort on the part of the Pay by Space system vendor. Since all the key information to be presented to the parking operator is already supplied by the API provided by server system without any further analysis required this information can simply be displayed or forwarded to the parking operator with minimal software development. This integration approach represents a pull followed by a push model.

The premise of a Pay and Display is that once an end user pays for parking the end user needs to leave a ticket inside the vehicle on the dashboard in order for parking enforcement personnel to perform visual checks of the ticket to ensure that the period of time paid for by the end user has not expired.

Historically Pay and Display dominated off street parking lots and parking garages. Despite the recent popularity of Pay by Space machines Pay and Display still has a vast installed base. There are also Pay and Display systems deployed for curbside parking.

In order to provide self enforcement capability server system requires the following information vehicle license plate information including state province actual parking start and end times paid parking duration.

In an embodiment integrating server system with a Pay and Display system server system gathers vehicle license plate information via the identification cameras while the destination cameras provide actual parking start and end times by allowing server system to determine when a vehicle pulls into a destination location and when the vehicle leaves. Paid parking duration may be determined by utilizing destination cameras with pan tilt and zoom capability and zooming in to extract a bar code or printed characters from the display ticket itself which an end user places on a vehicle dashboard.

In an embodiment to facilitate the reading of such information a Pay and Display machine may be configured to use a larger font for the printed characters or print larger versions of other identifying features. In another embodiment a Pay and Display machine may be configured to ask for a license plate number as part of a payment process whereas a conventional system would only ask for an amount of time a driver wishes to park a vehicle. In an embodiment a Pay and Display machine may utilize rolls of display ticket paper with an RFID chip embedded within each display ticket.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to perform pedestrian tracking based on multiple images captured via one or more cameras such as a camera including a Pay and Display machine within its field of view. With pedestrian tracking server system may be configured to track a driver and or passenger of a vehicle as they walk to and or from a vehicle for which payment is obtained via the Pay and Display machine much as server system performs vehicle tracking. Based on the tracked pedestrian movement the payment may be linked to a particular location for a vehicle and a corresponding vehicle identifier such as a license plate number determined by server system . Such an embodiment eliminates a need to capture information directly from a printed ticket. In an example server system may receive a plurality of pedestrian images captured by one or more cameras including one or more images demonstrating an individual was a passenger of the vehicle and one or more images demonstrating the passenger made a payment at a Pay and Display payment station for use of a destination location. Server system may be configured to perform tracking by determining whether characteristics determined for pedestrians captured in the pedestrian images correspond over time demonstrating that the passenger traveled between the vehicle and the payment station and made the payment. Based on this server system may associate the payment with use of a particular destination location by the vehicle.

With the above information available server system is able to produce a list of vehicle license plates with detailed violation information. This holds true regardless of whether the Pay and Display system supports real time wireless networking since the Pay and Display system itself does not possess any of the said information.

In an embodiment integrating server system with a Pay and Display system via an API provided by server system to provide self enforcement capability server system requires vehicle license plate information including state province information actual parking start and end times and paid parking duration.

Server system gathers vehicle license plate information via the identification cameras while the destination cameras allow server system to determine actual parking start and end times by detecting when a vehicle pulls into a parking space and when it leaves. Paid parking duration is determined by using destination cameras with pan tilt and zoom functionality enabling zooming in to extracting the bar code or printed characters from the display ticket itself which end users place on the vehicle dash.

The Pay and Display API provided by server system may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 uploading data to the third party parking payment system 4 receiving an acknowledgement for the uploaded data 5 responding to keep alive ping requests from the third party parking payment system and 6 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout. In connection with step 1 this may involve listening on a TCP or UDP port for the third party parking payment system to establish the connection. In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the Pay and Display API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the Pay and Display API upload vehicle parking information to the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle vacates a destination location associated with the third party parking payment system. The uploaded information for a particular vehicle may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information an identifier for the destination location recognized by the third party parking payment system which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system an actual date time the particular vehicle began use of the destination location and an actual date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

When server system is configured to operate in this mode server system transmits vehicle parking violation information to the Pay and Display system such as vehicle license plate number paid parking start and end times actual parking start and end times . The end result is the third party Pay and Display system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

Typically when a Pay and Display system or its staff is agreeable to using the API provided by server system the Pay and Display system or its staff is prepared to undertake some degree of custom software development generally for the purpose of receiving some useful data from server system . In this particular case the useful data is the paid parking start and end times and actual vehicle parking start and end times for a particular vehicle license plate number. In general Pay and Display systems are paper based as they rely on a printed display ticket and do not possess any information with respect to vehicle identity or destination location number. While Pay and Display systems do possess paid parking start time and paid parking duration these systems have no knowledge of which vehicle the paid parking correlates to. The Pay and Display system has the option of presenting a list of vehicles with parking violation information to the parking operator by using an API provided by server system . Through the API the Pay and Display system can obtain the pertinent information from server system and present it in any desired format.

As such integration via the API provided by server system is a push model where server system pushes all relevant information to the Pay and Display system. Subsequently the Pay and Display system displays a list of vehicle license plates with unpaid or expired parking. In other words Pay and Display integration via the API provided by server system is generally not accomplished in a pull model.

In an embodiment a Pay and Display machine with QR codes may be provided. QR codes have become popular and can easily hold all of the relevant information typically contained on a Pay and Display ticket such as parking duration parking expiration time amount paid date and time .

In an embodiment a Pay by Phone system may overlay a Pay and Display parking system and server system may be integrated with the Pay by Phone payment system via API. In such a case where a Pay by Phone system provided API is used server system will transmit vehicle detection information to the Pay by Phone system since typically the vehicle license plate information is already possessed by the Pay by Phone system. The end result is the Pay by Phone system will have the information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

While traditional curbside parking meters single or double space would only accept coins with no built in intelligence or networking capability Pay by Phone has become a popular overlay payment approach which works well with traditional curbside parking meters. Recently there has also been an emergence of curbside parking meters which accept both coins and credit cards and have networking capability built in.

Traditional parking meters generally have either a mechanical or an LCD display expired flag to indicate that a paid parking period has expired or parking is simply not paid. When parking has been paid and there is time remaining the mechanical expired flag typically red is hidden from view whereas the LCD display shows a clear display on the side of the meter facing the roadway. In contrast when paid parking has expired or when no payment has been made the red mechanical expired flag is prominently displayed in the up position while the LCD display facing the roadway flashes alternately between a clear display and a dark display sometimes also with a flashing red LED . Both of these are generally referred to as an expired flag.

In an embodiment server system can interface with traditional curbside parking meters using a combination of information gathered from both identification and destination cameras. In addition to identifying vehicle parking status such as but not limited to parking start and end times images captured by the identification and destination cameras can pinpoint paid parking status such as but not limited to whether a prepaid time has expired on the parking meters.

Server system gathers vehicle license plate information via the images captured by identification cameras while images captured by destination cameras enable server system to determine actual parking start and end times by detecting when a vehicle pulls into a parking space and when it leaves. Time of expiration of paid parking is determined by zooming in with both location and destination cameras and monitoring the visible status of the expiration flag on each parking meter. Based on this information server system may determine parking violation status and mark use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic. In situations where an expiration flag is not readable by server system server system may be configured to indicate an exception to a parking operator or staff and or make use of a Live Operator discussed below to manually determine parking violation status and or exception flag status.

A destination image captured by a destination camera from across the street will have sufficient angle of view to monitor the status of the expiration flag on each parking meter. Additionally an identification camera with pan tilt and zoom capability can be provided with sufficient zoom power and angle of view to also monitor the expiration flag status on each parking meter. With the above information available server system is able to produce a list of vehicle license plates with detailed violation information.

In an embodiment integrating server system with a Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system via an API provided by server system to provide self enforcement capability server system requires vehicle license plate information including state province information actual parking start and end times and paid parking duration.

Server system gathers vehicle license plate information via the images captured by identification cameras while images captured by destination cameras enable server system to determine actual parking start and end times by detecting when a vehicle pulls into a parking space and when it leaves. Time of expiration of paid parking is determined by zooming in with both location and destination cameras and monitoring the visible status of the expiration flag on each parking meter.

In situations where an expiration flag is not readable by server system server system may be configured to indicate an exception to a parking operator or staff and or make use of a Live Operator discussed below to manually determine parking violation status and or exception flag status.

The Traditional Curbside Parking Meter API provided by server system may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 uploading data to the third party parking payment system 4 receiving an acknowledgement for the uploaded data 5 responding to keep alive ping requests from the third party parking payment system and 6 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout. In connection with step 1 this may involve listening on a TCP or UDP port for the third party parking payment system to establish the connection. In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter API upload vehicle parking information to the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle vacates a destination location associated with the third party parking payment system. The uploaded information for a particular vehicle may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information an identifier for the destination location recognized by the third party parking payment system which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system an actual date time the particular vehicle began use of the destination location and an actual date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

When server system is configured to operate in this mode server system transmits vehicle parking violation information to the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system which is typically a payment collection tallying system with no connectivity to the actual curbside meters. The end result is that the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

Typically when a Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system or its staff is agreeable to using the API provided by server system the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system or its staff is prepared to undertake some degree of custom software development generally for the purpose of receiving some useful data from server system . In this particular case the useful data is the expired or unpaid parking status and actual vehicle parking start and end times for a particular vehicle license plate number. In general Traditional Curbside Parking Meter systems do not possess any information with respect to vehicle identity or space number.

As such integration via the API provided by server system is a push model where server system pushes all relevant information to the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system. Subsequently the Traditional Curbside Parking Meter system displays a list of vehicle license plates with unpaid or expired parking.

In an embodiment a Pay by Phone system may overlay a traditional curbside parking system and server system may be integrated with the Pay by Phone payment system via API. In such a case where a Pay by Phone system provided API is used server system will transmit vehicle detection information to the Pay by Phone system since typically the vehicle license plate information is already possessed by the Pay by Phone system. The end result is the Pay by Phone system will have the information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

More recently curbside parking meters single or double space have been introduced which perform credit card authorization using a built in 3G or WiFi modem. In an embodiment server system can be configured to interface with this type of parking meters through a Curbside Parking Meter API. Specifically since these curbside parking meters already have built in wireless network connectivity and an associated backend server it is not difficult for server system to integrate with this third party backend server.

When server system is configured to operate in this mode an integration module for the Curbside Parking Meter API performs steps including 1 establishing a connection with a third party Curbside Parking Meter API 2 issuing a request for data 3 receiving data 4 processing and storing data to database 5 determining parking violation status 6 marking use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic 7 periodic confirmation that the Curbside Parking Meter API is active and valid such as but not limited to by use of keep alive ping messages or commands and 8 repeating steps 2 7 or closing the connection. In connection with step 1 an API typically specifies the mechanism through which a connection to it can be established. The integration module for the Curbside Parking Meter API is configured to observe the protocol required by the Curbside Parking Meter API and establishes a connection.

In connection with step 2 when server system determines that a particular vehicle has vacated a destination location server system signals this event to the integration module for the Curbside Parking Meter API such as via a database or Inter Process Communication IPC call in response to which the integration module for the Curbside Parking Meter API issues a request to the third party Curbside Parking Meter API for parking payment information for the particular vehicle. Data sent to the third party Curbside Parking Meter API may include for example an identifier for the destination location recognized by the Curbside Parking Meter API which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system and a date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

In connection with step 3 the integration module for the Curbside Parking Meter API may be configured to receive information from the third party Curbside Parking Meter API including for example an identifier for the destination location recognized by the Curbside Parking Meter API which may require translation to an identifier used internally by server system a paid parking start date time and a paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 the integration module for the Curbside Parking Meter API may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

As such integration via Curbside Parking Meter API is a pull model where server system pulls all relevant information the third party Curbside Parking Meter system is capable of outputting and adds automated vehicle violation information determined by server system to produce a list of vehicle license plates with unpaid or expired parking. In other words integration via Curbside Parking Meter API is generally not accomplished in a push model.

In an embodiment in which server system is configured to integrate with a Curbside Parking Meter system via an API provided by server system server system transmits vehicle information to the Curbside Parking Meter system such as vehicle license plate number destination location and actual parking start and end times . The end result is the Curbside Parking Meter system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

Typically when a Curbside Parking Meter system or its staff is agreeable to using the API provided by server system the Curbside Parking Meter system or its staff is prepared to undertake some degree of custom software development generally for the purpose of receiving some useful data from server system . In this particular case the useful data is actual vehicle parking duration the actual amount of time a particular vehicle has occupied a specific destination location for a particular vehicle license plate number or destination location number. In general Curbside Parking Meter systems already have the vehicle license plate number or space number as this information may be obtained as part of the end user payment process.

Integration via a Curbside Parking Meter API provided by server system may be according to one of two options. First is a data inflow model in which the third party parking payment system pushes information into server system . Second is a data outflow model in which server system pushes all relevant information to the Curbside Parking Meter system.

In an embodiment server system may include an inflow based Curbside Parking Meter API for use by a third party parking payment system via for example network in which the third party parking payment system pushes information into server system via the inflow based Curbside Parking Meter API. The inflow based Curbside Parking Meter API may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 receiving data from the third party parking payment system 4 processing and storing data to database 5 determining parking violation status 6 marking use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic 7 periodic confirmation that the inflow based Curbside Parking Meter API is active and valid such as but not limited to by use of keep alive ping messages or commands and 8 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout. In connection with step 1 this may involve listening on a TCP or UDP port for the third party parking payment system to establish the connection. In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the inflow based Curbside Parking Meter API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the inflow based Curbside Parking Meter API receive vehicle parking information from the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle driver pays for parking. The received information for a particular vehicle may include for example an identifier for a destination location for which payment was received in connection with the particular vehicle which may require translation to an identifier used internally by server system a paid parking start date time and a paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 a Curbside Parking Meter integration module included in server system may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

In an embodiment server system may include an outflow based Curbside Parking Meter API for use by a third party parking payment system via for example network in which server system pushes all relevant information to the third party Curbside Parking Meter system. The outflow based Curbside Parking Meter API may be configured to perform steps including for example 1 waiting for the third party parking payment system to establish a connection 2 authenticating the identity of the third party parking payment system 3 uploading data to the third party parking payment system 4 receiving an acknowledgement for the uploaded data 5 responding to keep alive ping requests from the third party parking payment system and 6 closing the connection when requested or upon timeout. In connection with step 1 this may involve listening on a TCP or UDP port for the third party parking payment system to establish the connection. In connection with step 2 the third party parking payment system is required to authenticate itself through the outflow based Curbside Parking Meter API before data exchange is permitted. If authentication fails a retry mechanism may be provided and after several unsuccessful attempts the connection may be dropped. In connection with step 3 server system may be configured to via the outflow based Curbside Parking Meter API upload vehicle parking information to the third party parking payment system every time a vehicle vacates a destination location associated with the third party parking payment system. The uploaded information for a particular vehicle may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information an identifier for the destination location recognized by the third party parking payment system which may require translation from an identifier used internally by server system an actual date time the particular vehicle began use of the destination location and an actual date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to integrate with a Curbside Parking Meter system in two steps. First server system obtains vehicle payment information from the Curbside Parking Meter system such as paid parking start and end times parking space number vehicle license plate number by using the Curbside Parking Meter system provided API. At this stage server system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details. However instead of server system presenting this list to a parking operator there may be instances where an incumbent parking payment vendor wishes to retain control over how the parking violation information flows back to the parking operator. This can be accomplished by sending the vehicle violation data back to the Curbside Parking Meter system by using an API provided by server system . The Curbside Parking Meter system will then have total control over how the list of offending vehicles is presented to the parking operator such as by use of a custom software application developed by the Curbside Parking Meter system vendor .

A significant difference between this integration method and integration via the API provided by server system is that this integration method requires minimal development effort on the part of the Curbside Parking Meter system vendor. Since all the key information to be presented to the parking operator is already supplied by the API provided by server system without any further analysis required this information can simply be displayed or forwarded to the parking operator with minimal software development. This integration approach represents a pull followed by a push model.

Similar to Pay by Space where a parking payment is associated with a particular numbered parking space in which a vehicle parks Pay by Plate associates a parking payment to a vehicle with a particular license plate parked in a parking space. Manual enforcement of Pay by Plate parking typically involves the enforcement officer driving past the physical parking space to ensure license plates of all parked vehicles are on a list of license plates with paid status. Conversely any parked vehicles with license plates not on the paid list would receive a parking citation.

Similar to the above described Pay by Phone and Pay by Space integration can be accomplished by using either a Pay by Plate system provided API or an API provided by server system . The objective is for either system to gain access to all the information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation information.

In an embodiment in which server system is integrated via a Pay by Plate system provided API server system obtains vehicle payment information from the Pay by Plate system such as paid parking start and end times and vehicle license plate numbers . The end result is server system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

In an embodiment server system may include a Pay by Plate integration module which may be a software component that extracts parking payment information from a third party parking payment system which server system uses for parking self enforcement. The integration module for pay by plate performs steps including 1 establishing a connection with a third party Pay by Plate API 2 issuing a request for data 3 receiving data 4 processing and storing data to database 5 determining parking violation status 6 marking use of a destination location as a parking violation in database for further processing for example by the below described parking violation pre processing logic 7 periodic confirmation that the third party Pay by Plate API is active and valid such as but not limited to by use of keep alive ping messages or commands and 8 repeating steps 2 7 or closing the connection. In connection with step 1 an API typically specifies the mechanism through which a connection to it can be established. The Pay by Plate integration module is configured to observe the protocol required by the third party Pay by Plate API and establishes a connection.

In connection with step 2 when server system determines that a particular vehicle has vacated a destination location server system signals this event to the Pay by Plate integration module such as via a database or Inter Process Communication IPC call in response to which the Pay by Plate integration module issues a request to the third party Pay by Plate API for parking payment information for the particular vehicle. Data sent to the third party Pay by Plate API may include for example vehicle license plate information including plate number and state province information and a date time the particular vehicle vacated the destination location.

In connection with step 3 the Pay by Plate integration module may be configured to receive information from the third party Pay by Plate API including for example a paid parking start date time and a paid parking end date time. In connection with step 5 the Pay by Plate integration module may be configured to compare a duration of paid parking indicated by the data received from step 3 with the actual parking duration determined by server system . If the actual parking duration exceeds the paid parking duration processing of step 6 is performed otherwise step 6 is not performed.

In an embodiment in which server system is integrated with a Pay by Plate system via an API provided by server system server system transmits vehicle information to the Pay by Plate system such as vehicle license plate number destination location and actual parking start and end times . The end result is the Pay by Plate system will have the precise information required to generate a list of vehicle license plates with parking violation details.

Typically when a Pay by Plate system or its staff is agreeable to using the API provided by server system the Pay by Plate system or its staff is prepared to undertake some degree of custom software development generally for the purpose of receiving some useful data from server system . In this particular case the useful data is actual vehicle parking duration an actual amount of time a particular vehicle has occupied a destination location for a particular vehicle license plate number. By definition Pay by Plate systems already have the vehicle license plate number as this is obtained as part of the end user payment process.

Integration via a Pay by Plate API provided by server system may be according to one of two options.

There are two main reasons why use of a Live Operator team as part of the system illustrated in warrants consideration and may offer a practical option to offer to prospective parking operators as a value added feature.

First although server system autonomously receives and processes images obtained from the identification and destination cameras there are typically live operators who monitor obtained images and software executing on server system . These live operators can review operation of server system and take appropriate actions on an exception basis if required. For example when unexpected problems occur Live Operators can review images related to the problems and deduce information that server system may not be configured to handle.

An advantage with the networked architecture supported by server system is that a single Live Operator team can oversee or augment operations at multiple sites regardless of their respective geographic locations or the fact that the facility operations may be owned by different parking operations or even competitors. As a result the Live Operator option can be a scalable and cost effective approach for parking operators. Furthermore by using IP multicast or similar standard TCP IP protocol a video stream can effectively be sent simultaneously to multiple destinations thereby allowing the Live Operator option to be added at a future date in addition to local on site monitoring staffed by the parking operators.

Second depending on the available technology Pay and Display and curbside meter configurations discussed above may present significant real life challenges. Not only are cameras with a high level of zoom are required there are also potential problems such as that an angle of view from a particular video camera may not be sufficient to properly detect an expiration flag of a traditional curbside parking meter or a bar code on a Pay and Display ticket on a vehicle dashboard may be facing away from any of the video cameras due to the physical three dimensional shape of the dashboard and the placement of the ticket itself.

With the Live Operator option server system can generate exception events to the Live Operator when server system fails to automatically detect a key piece of information such as license plate number status of an expiration flag on a traditional parking meter or bar code printed information on a Pay and Display ticket. Such an exception event may trigger a Live Operator to take a number of specific actions including but not limited to Rewind Fast Forward Pause Freeze Frame FWD RWD specific footages captured by identification and or destination cameras zoom in out on particular areas of interest in the captured footages Pan Tilt Zoom video cameras in real time in order to obtain enhanced images and dispatch on site personnel to perform inspection of a vehicle or parking meter either visually of by use of mobile device to obtain enhanced images for use by server system .

In an embodiment server system is configured to correlate a mailing address of a registered owner of a vehicle with its license plate number allowing a parking operator to collect parking citation revenue. Red light camera systems utilize such a mechanism to have citation tickets mailed to registered owners of the vehicles. In connection with such functionality parking operators are in three different categories.

First in the event that the parking operator is part of the city municipality who may already have access to DMV records server system only needs to supply a list of Vehicle License Plate Numbers with state province information along with parking violation details such as date time and location in order for citations to be mailed to registered owners.

Second for private parking operators with no pre established access to DMV records there are a number of legislated ways to obtain personal information including name and address tied to a Vehicle License Plate Number. These methods vary from state to state and provinces . As an example in the State of New York private parking operators are allowed to gain access to such information by use of Driver s Privacy Protection Act DPPA form MV 15DPPA for use in connection with the operation of private toll transportation facilities including companies that operate parking facilities for the purpose of providing notice to the owners of vehicles who have used the facility. For some jurisdictions name and address information may be released online and server system may be configured to obtain and process such information. In some jurisdictions name and address information of a third party vehicle owner may not be released online but instead must be obtained either by mail or in person. In such jurisdictions private parking operators may wish to obtain name and address information on a batched basis such as daily every 2 or 3 days or weekly .

Third for private parking operators who prefer real time access to registered owner information a number of private Vehicle License Number Plate databases are available via the Internet. The main advantage of this approach is that name and address information can be immediately and automatically retrieved with no manual operation required.

As noted in connection with end user systems can include in vehicle systems. In an embodiment new vehicle dashboards straight from car manufacturers can include an indicator icon similar to other dashboard lights such as check engine parking brake warnings or cruise control indicator lights. This indicator icon is normally not illuminated when vehicle is driving on the highway or not inside a perimeter serviced by server system . As vehicle approaches parking lots or curbside parking areas the indicator icon may light up in amber advising an end user of the availability of automated parking services provided by server system . When vehicle pulls into a destination location such as a parking space the indicator icon turns red to notify the end user that parking has not been paid. Once parking has been paid whether by the afore mentioned Pay by Phone curbside meter Pay by Space or other techniques the indicator icon turns green to signify parking has been paid. In an embodiment these visual indications may be accompanied by audio notifications which may be simple chimes or voice announcements. Audio output may be performed by providing audio information or data to a vehicle entertainment unit.

As this invention enables many aspects of parking payment and enforcement processes to be automated it is important to provide feedback to end users as to what the server system is doing or a particular state server system has associated with vehicle for example whether vehicle has committed a parking violation . End users can then react accordingly to the feedback provided. While operating within a highly automated payment and enforcement system it is a reasonable expectation that end users or registered owners do not get penalized for minor or administrative errors. Feedback provided via a simple interface such as the dashboard indicator icon can greatly alleviate this concern.

For example as vehicle parks if the indicator icon remains red after some time the end user realizes an exception event has taken place. It may be that a credit card number on file has expired and therefore server system is not able to apply a parking charge. This feedback provides the end user the opportunity to for example visit a website provided by or in connection with server system to query his her account status and correct the error.

There are a number of potential sources of information by which the dashboard indicator icon can get its information from including built in cellular data or WiFi vehicle connectivity or smart sensors discussed below . For older vehicles without factory installed indicator icons end users may be provided with a retrofit kit in the form of a visual module which receives information by way of Bluetooth cellular data or WiFi connectivity.

In an embodiment the indicator icon feature receives GPS location data from third party in vehicle subsystems via a vehicle wiring harness. The GPS data allows the indicator icon feature to determine whether vehicle is currently in a paid parking zone.

Similar to the vehicle dashboard icon smart sensors can be designed into new vehicles straight from the factory. Using technology similar to the ZigBee IEEE 802.15.4 standard low cost low power short range wireless mesh networks can be created among vehicles as well as between vehicles and parking equipment. Each vehicle becomes a node and a node can communicate with a distant end point by relaying data through intermediate nodes by forming a mesh network. Each smart sensor contains a unique identifier such that license plate information is no longer critical. In an embodiment smart sensors may be configured to communicate with server system via a cellular data connection and or provide Pay by Phone functionality whereby payment for use of a destination location may be made via the smart sensor.

Many applications are possible with the introduction of such smart sensors. For example the smart sensors can include a GPS receiver or communicate with an in vehicle GPS to determine a present location of vehicle and report the present location to server system . With some GPS techniques such as assisted GPS a location determined via GPS may have enough accuracy and precision to determine the vehicle is making use of a particular destination location. These sensors can also communicate with parking meters and in essence report the presence of the vehicle and how long it has been parked for. This parking information can be relayed to a distant device network through the mesh network so the parking equipment does not need to be located within the vicinity of the vehicle. For vehicles equipped with smart sensors use of the identification and destination cameras is not necessary as the embedded smart sensor already provide a unique identity of the vehicle to server system .

In an embodiment vehicles may be equipped with a near field communication NFC device such as an RFID chip. For example such a communication device may be included in a mirror hanger. In another example an RFID chip may be embedded in a ticket provided by a Pay and Display device. By obtaining a vehicle identification from a near field communication device use of images captured by identification cameras such as images including license plate information may not be required by server system and or may be used to verify information received from an NFC device corresponding to an observed vehicle.

In an embodiment the smart sensors can sense the status of other vehicles nearby such as but not limited to whether they are moving parked and for what duration they have been parked and report the status to server system . The end result is that server system is aware as to where almost any smart sensor equipped vehicle is parked and for how long. By combining this information with parking payment information from either third party systems or turnkey platforms it is possible to determine the identity of vehicles that did not pay for parking or with expired parking and have parking violation tickets mailed to the registered owners or even charging a parking fine on the spot for example by charging a credit card on file .

In an embodiment a destination camera can be provided with laser status notification. Similar to laser logo devices seen at shopping malls and retail outlets the laser status notification feature shines a nonharmful flashing red light enveloping a parked vehicle to notify an end user upon return that parking was not paid or has expired. This is akin to returning to a vehicle and seeing a parking ticket clipped under the windshield wiper under the traditional manual parking enforcement model. As a destination camera is typically located at elevation with respect to vehicles an included laser status notification module has a bird s eye view to below destination locations to facilitate shining laser notification onto vehicles and destination locations.

In an embodiment laser status notification feature replaces the need to mail out paper parking violation tickets. Once an end user receives a laser notification for a parking violation the end user can then be expected to pay the parking fine through a number of media including but not limited to an online website or Pay by Phone. Furthermore laser status notifications can be captured by the destination camera to provide later evidence of the parking violation and notification.

In an embodiment dynamic real time Individual Parking Space Reservation is a feature made possible by an online phone smart phone parking space reservation system and may be further enhanced with the laser status notification feature. While currently some vendors offer parking space reservation feature the feature is limited to space reservation in the general vicinity of parking spaces for example somewhere on a parking lot as there is no practical method of physically reserving a single particular parking space in an automated fashion. In addition the reserved spaces are typically held open for a long period of time because there is also no practical way of knowing when a reserved parking spot becomes available again after the driver who reserved the space has parked and subsequently driven off.

In contrast the dynamic real time Individual Parking Space Reservation feature allows end users to pinpoint the exact parking space they desire for example a space closest to a shopping mall during Christmas shopping period for a specified period of time for example a destination location may be reserved for use during some day in the future . Once a parking space has been reserved a laser notification may be shined on the parking spot to indicate that the destination location is reserved providing for example a red color as a warning to other drivers . The use of a destination location during a reserved period by another vehicle will result in a parking violation. This enables a parking operator to increase revenue by offering both tiered premium parking spots and advance reservation of parking spaces.

In an embodiment a parking operator may designate particular destination locations as restricted only for use by vehicles for which a reservation has been made. In this embodiment server system may determine a number of available reserved destination locations for a given time and price reservations according to how many unreserved destination locations remain available. In an embodiment server system may be configured to allow buyers to submit competing bids for the use of reserved destination locations.

In an embodiment a Pay by Phone feature can be offered either directly on a turnkey platform or through a partnership with a third party vendor. The end result is that end users can pay for parking by calling a particular IVR phone line input a destination location number or vehicle license plate number and a duration of parking. In another embodiment Pay Online is a variation along the same theme to support online payment for parking typically via a website accessible via a web enabled smartphone.

In an embodiment a push technology feature can be incorporated where as soon as an end user parks vehicle the end user receives a text message or other notification prompting for an affirmative reply to charge a specific parking rate until vehicle leaves a destination location. Server system identifies vehicle via an identification camera and further determines that vehicle is associated with a pre registered end user with credit card or other billing information and a cellular phone number or other contact information on record. Once server system determines via a destination camera that vehicle has parked in a destination location server system initiates a push sequence to actively notify and engage the driver for payment or confirmation of payment. By simplifying the payment process improved parking revenue is realized.

In many traditional parking meter systems if an end user pays for more time than actually used by the end user excess time remains on the meter for use by a following end user. In an embodiment of the disclosed subject matter as destination camera allows server system to accurately determine when a vehicle leaves a destination location any leftover paid parking time can be reset to zero. One exception is traditional curbside meters as these typically do not have any communication capability or the intelligence to activate the expiration flag prior to time expiration.

Server system may be configured to provide a push technology software component that enhances the user experience when it comes to paying for parking. Push technology supports functions such as 1 initiating a payment sequence via text message 2 allowing a pre registered user to take a photo of their license plate then provide the photo to server system by way of for example email or text message 3 allowing a non registered user to take a photo of their license plate then provide the photo to server system by way of for example email or text message and 4 allowing drivers to sign up once to not get parking fees under a subscription based model. The push technology component interacts with vehicle identifier detection logic vehicle detection logic database and a payment gateway. In connection with item 1 based on a vehicle identifier of the vehicle that has just begun use of a destination location such as a parking space the push technology component pushes a text message indicating that use of the destination location has begun to a mobile phone number registered with server system . When the driver assents to the text message by replying with yes a credit card associated with the registered account may then get charged an appropriate usage fee such as but not limited to a flat rate parking fee for use of the destination location. In connection with item 2 a driver who has pre registered with server system may take photos of their license plate then email or text message the photo to server system . A credit card associated with a registered account for the pre registered user then gets charged a usage fee. In connection with item 3 for vehicles bearing license plates not registered with server system a driver may take a photo of the license plate then email text message the photo to server system . Where a mobile phone service provider supports and provides access to such a billing feature usage charges may be added to a user s monthly mobile device bill. In connection with item 4 a driver may sign up once to automatically pay for all usage fees or at least all parking fees with a registered credit card. The push technology software component may also be configured to automatically send a text message to a user In the event that server system determines inappropriate use of a destination location such as parking a vehicle in a no parking area.

Server system may be configured to provide a parking violation pre processing logic software component that examines all occurrences of destination location usages newly identified as violations and assigns them to a corresponding destination as specified in a system configuration such as the license plate lookup module or the license plate forward module discussed below. The parking violation pre processing logic software component interacts with database the system configuration utility and third party APIs. The parking violation pre processing logic software component may be configured to 1 enqueue violations identified by other software processes included in server system 2 examine the next violation in the queue 3 validate the destination location usage is a violation by verifying rules established via the system configuration utility in connection with the destination location and detected use of the destination location by a vehicle 4 assign the violation to license plate processing logic and 5 examine any other enqueued violations or await an identification of a later violation.

Server system may be configured to determine whether a vehicle has an expired tag from an identification image. The identification image may be captured using a fixed Identification camera although at typical distances and vehicle speeds and the small size of the typical expiration date indicator on a license plate determining whether a vehicle bears an expired tag from the identification image alone is generally not possible. With a PTZ capable camera zoomed into a license plate of a stationary vehicle either with an Identification camera or destination camera it may be possible to zoom into a license plate to obtain enough detail to determine whether a vehicle bears an expired tag from the obtained image alone. In an embodiment the identification image instead can be captured via a mobile or handheld camera including for example a camera included in a smartphone or mobile device . An identification image obtained from such sources often has enough detail to determine whether a vehicle bears an expired tag from the identification image alone. In an embodiment rather than use an image alone to determine if a tag is expired server system may be configured to query via an API to a municipal database determine whether a vehicle registration for a particular license plate number is expired. Server system may be configured to in the event it determines a vehicle is bearing an expired tag report the vehicle to a municipality.

Server system may be configured to provide a license plate processing logic software component that takes an identified destination location usage violation such as a violation assigned by the parking violation pre processing logic component and converts it into an actionable item for either a Registered Owner RO user of a vehicle involved in the destination location usage violation or for a parking operator responsible for the destination location. For example the actionable item can be in the form of a parking citation automatically mailed to the registered owner or a license plate number displayed on a screen at a parking operations office. The license plate processing logic software component interacts with the parking violation pre processing logic software component system configuration utility and database . The license plate processing logic component may be configured to check one or more business rules specified via the system configuration utility in connection with the destination location to determine the appropriate actionable item. For example if a business rule specifies license plate lookup a specific type of license plate lookup may also be specified such as via an API provided by a municipality or an API provided by a private business. Then license plate lookup is performed as specified. Also business rules may identify sub options such as mailing out parking tickets to a registered owner via API or just providing a mailing address for a registered owner and any other associated information for the violation to the parking operator. In another example if a business rule specifies license plate information forwarding the license plate processing logic component checks to see the specific type of license plate information forwarding specified and forwards the license plate information accordingly.

In order to utilize a license plate lookup API option for the purpose of identifying a mailing address for a registered owner from a license plate vehicle identifier a license plate database such as one provided by a private business must exist and be available for searches for license plates belonging to a particular state province for the license plate. Also use of such a database must be reasonable in terms of any fees involved to such lookup is commercially viable. In the event that either condition above does not materialize an alternative option may include providing the license plate in question to a municipal body which typically has access to license plate records via the local police branch or otherwise.

The license plate processing logic software component may include a license plate lookup and followup submodule. The license plate lookup and followup submodule may be configured to make an API call to a license plate database to retrieve the mailing address for a registered owner of a vehicle. Examples of such databases include an HTTP based Dial in Search Account API provided by the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles database services provided by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators AAMVA or other insurance companies and online collections of public records such as PublicData.com although many such collections are less reliable than government or commercially managed databases thus possibly requiring additional efforts to ensure information is valid and accurate .

Also the license plate lookup and followup submodule may be configured to automatically mail a parking citation to a registered owner associated with a vehicle that has misused a destination location. For example the process of mailing may be automated via an API call to a printing mailing service such as but not limited to L Mail.com.

In an embodiment the license plate lookup and followup submodule may be configured to create maintain and review records in database to see if a given vehicle identifier such as a license plate is associated with prior misuse of a destination location within a specified period of time which is configurable via for example the system configuration utility If so the license plate lookup and followup submodule may presume that the previously obtained address remains valid and accurate skip the API call and mail a citation using the previously obtained mailing address in the system in order to lower operating expenses associated with API calls. In the event that the parking citation has not been paid after a specified number of days actual duration also configurable via for example the system configuration utility or the citation is returned as undeliverable a subsequent API call may be made to obtain a current address.

In an embodiment a parking violation such as but not limited to when paid parking expires or a vehicle is parked without payment server system may be configured to notify one or more enforcement officers with a location of a destination location such as a longitude and latitude or an approximate street address. An enforcement officer then may go to the offending vehicle and issue a citation on the spot. In an embodiment server system may be configured to identify and or locate an individual enforcement officer who is best suited to deal with a particular offending vehicle. Factors for making this identification may include for example the distance from the offending vehicle or workload of an enforcement officer or whether an offending vehicle is to be towed for example where an offending vehicle must be promptly removed . In an embodiment offending vehicles may have to be enqueued where for example there are too few enforcement officers or a particular enforcement officer has multiple offending vehicles to handle. In an embodiment multiple enforcement officers may be notified of nearby offending vehicles and individual enforcement officers may accept to handle particular offending vehicles. Server system may also be configured to track enforcement officer performance which may be used in connection with a reward or quota system for the enforcement officers. In an embodiment an enforcement officer may be equipped with a mobile device and mobile device may be configured to preprint a citation for an offending vehicle to reduce an amount of time taken to deliver the citation to the vehicle.

Server system may be configured to provide dynamic variable rate parking fees. In an embodiment server system may record different parking rates for a destination location which vary according to time of day and or day of the week for example. In the event that a vehicle occupies a destination location over a period of time in which first and second rates apply server system may be configured to determine a total fee for use of the destination location based the first rate being applied from the beginning of the use of the destination location until the second rate applies and the second rate being applied for the remaining time the vehicle occupies the destination location. In an embodiment server system may be configured to determine a number of vehicles which may be accommodated by the destination locations available in a given area and base a fee or rate for parking on the determined number of vehicles. For example as server system determines this number decreases for example because there are fewer remaining destination locations it may apply a higher rate for vehicles which begin to make use of the few remaining locations.

Server system may be configured to allow a parking provider via an API or the configuration utility specify particular events for which a specified parking rate or flat fee is to be applied for specified destination locations. For example if a concert occurs from 7 11 PM at a venue associated with or near a parking facility the parking facility may levy a flat 10 fee for vehicles parked after 4 PM that same evening.

Server system may be configured to provide a no fine feature where a driver may leave a vehicle parked in a destination location for as long as they wish and have a credit card or other account billed for according to rules established for the destination location such as but not limited to per hour or flat rate per day fees . In an embodiment a text message or email may be pushed or otherwise sent to the driver indicating that the no fine feature is available for the destination location and allowing the driver to elect use of the no fine feature such as by replying with a message such as yes or no fine . In an embodiment server system may be configured to generally make the no fine feature available for all unrestricted destination locations in specified areas or throughout the destination locations tracked by server system . However server system may be configured not to offer the no fine feature for a restricted destination location such as for example a destination location subject to a 3 6 PM no parking rush hour restriction.

In an embodiment server system may be able to perform profiling based on 3D outline of the vehicle. For example such profiling may be able to roughly profile a vehicle as belong to a category such as but not limited to sport utility vehicle SUV van sedan coupe or motorcycle. In addition a vehicle may be categorized as having a light or dark color. The vehicle profiling can serve non parking applications such as but not limited to assisting police tracking of stolen vehicles within a certain vicinity Amber alert Homeland Security needs. In an embodiment the vehicle profiling can be used to provide additional vehicle characteristics for comparisons performed in tracking a vehicle from one tracking camera to another. In an embodiment the vehicle profiling may provide an additional layer of confirmation of an identity of a vehicle for an automated parking citation mailing process. In an embodiment manual 3D vehicle profiles are provided to server system . For example one manual 3D vehicle profile for a Chevrolet Impala may describe a ratio of 1 2 1 for height of hood to height of passenger compartment to height of trunk.

In an embodiment a laser transmitter which may be integrated with an actuated beam deflecting mirror may be configured to shine a laser beam onto one or more destination locations. In an embodiment the laser beam may shine on a retroreflector mounted on or around a destination location to provide a return signal to a receiver associated with the laser transceiver. When a vehicle occupies a destination location illuminated by the laser beam the presence of the vehicle is detected by interruption of the laser beam or a return signal. In response to this detection server system may be configured to obtain a destination image and or an identifier image with a nearby camera.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to in addition to the aforementioned uses involving vehicle identification also use an identification camera as a red light camera for the detection of events in which a vehicle incorrectly proceeds through an intersection controlled by a traffic light. For example as a traffic light changes from amber to red vehicles incorrectly proceeding through a late amber or red light may be identified along with a captured vehicle license plate such that server system is configured to simultaneously utilize an imaging camera for both purposes. Alternatively or in addition server system may be configured to use an identification camera to detect block the box moving violations where a vehicle remains within an intersection during a red light for the vehicle s direction of travel which may lead to gridlock high traffic situations.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to provide real time vehicle tracking services for third parties such as but not limited to repossession companies for locating vehicles with outstanding loan payments law enforcement homeland security. Server system may provide an API by which such third party entities may register vehicles of interest by for example a vehicle identifier such as a license plate. In the event that server system determines the presence of a vehicle with the vehicle identifier the registering party may be notified. Notifications may be provided in connection with an initial detection of the vehicle and or when the vehicle is determined to have stopped. In an embodiment records of the movements of a registered vehicle may be retained by server system and made accessible for example via a map based web interface which may be configured to present updated information in real time. The API may also allow a third party to designate an area of interest for which server system is configured to perform identification and tracking of any vehicles determined to have entered the area of interest. Server system may also be configured to provide images of registered vehicles obtained by the tracking cameras. In an embodiment any archived tracking information such as the past use of destination locations may also be made available to reconstruct a person s whereabouts over time assuming the person is connected with the vehicle . In an embodiment server system may be configured to obtain vehicle images including an image of a driver s face and may further be configured to perform facial recognition techniques to confirm facial characteristics of the driver correspond to a person of interest.

In an embodiment server system may be configured to determine and provide traffic count information such as the number of vehicles determined to have traversed a given portion of roadway. Such information may be employed for purposes including but not limited to dynamic control of traffic systems such as traffic lights in response to currently observed traffic counts and for determining construction requirements based on traffic counts observed over time. The traffic count information may include and or be filtered on the basis of time and or date and or determined vehicle characteristics including but not limited to direction of travel and vehicle size or type such as SUV truck car or motorcycle . Additionally server system may determine vehicle counts in connection with a direction of entry and or exit for a portion of roadway such as for example how many vehicles were northbound or southbound upon exiting an eastbound portion of roadway based on a direction each vehicle exits an intersection. In an embodiment server system may be configured for use in controlling access to and or levy a toll upon vehicles by type such as assessing a fee for the use of specified roadways by large trucks.

Computer system may be coupled via bus to a display such as a cathode ray tube CRT or liquid crystal display LCD for displaying information to a computer user. An input device including alphanumeric and other keys is coupled to bus for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control such as a mouse a trackball or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes a first axis e.g. x and a second axis e.g. y that allows the device to specify positions in a plane. Another type of user input device is a touchscreen which generally combines display with hardware that registers touches upon display .

The invention is related to the use of one or more computer systems such as computer system collectively configured and or programmed to perform implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention those techniques are performed by computer system in response to processor executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory from another machine readable medium such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory causes processor to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments hard wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.

The term machine readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing data that causes a machine to operation in a specific fashion. In an embodiment implemented using computer system various machine readable media are involved for example in providing instructions to processor for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media includes for example optical or magnetic disks such as storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory such as main memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves such as those generated during radio wave and infra red data communications. All such media must be tangible and or nontransitory to enable the instructions carried by the media to be detected by a physical mechanism that reads the instructions into a machine.

Common forms of machine readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape or any other magnetic medium a CD ROM any other optical medium punchcards papertape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM and EPROM a FLASH EPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave as described hereinafter or any other medium from which a computer can read.

Various forms of machine readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor for execution. For example the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra red transmitter to convert the data to an infra red signal. An infra red detector can receive the data carried in the infra red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus carries the data to main memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor .

Computer system also includes a communication interface coupled to bus . Communication interface provides a two way data communication coupling to a network link that is connected to a local network . For example communication interface may be an integrated services digital network ISDN card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example communication interface may be a local area network LAN card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation communication interface sends and receives electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.

Network link typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider ISP . ISP in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the Internet . Local network and Internet both use electrical electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams. The signals through the various networks and the signals on network link and through communication interface which carry the digital data to and from computer system are exemplary forms of carrier waves transporting the information.

Computer system can send messages and receive data including program code through the network s network link and communication interface . In the Internet example a server might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet ISP local network and communication interface .

The received code may be executed by processor as it is received and or stored in storage device or other non volatile storage for later execution. In this manner computer system may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.
