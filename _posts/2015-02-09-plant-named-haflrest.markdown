title: plant named ‘Haflrest’
abstract: A new and distinct cultivar of plant named ‘Haflrest’, characterized by its upright, outwardly spreading to somewhat trailing and mounding plant habit; vigorous growth habit; freely branching habit; freely flowering habit; long flowering period; large inflorescences with dark orange-colored ray florets with yellow-colored borders and bright yellow-colored disc florets; and strong peduncles that hold the inflorescences above and beyond the foliar plane.

The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of plant botanically known as and hereinafter referred to by the name Haflrest .

The new plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Okayama ken Japan. The objective of the breeding program is to create new freely branching plants with unique ray floret coloration.

The new plant originated from a self pollination made by the Inventor in Okayama ken Japan in January 2010 of K SAIKA001 not patented. The new plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated self pollination in a controlled greenhouse environment in Okayama ken Japan in May 2010.

Asexual reproduction of the new plant by vegetative cuttings in a controlled environment in Okayama ken Japan since June 2010 has shown that the unique features of this new plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations.

Plants of the new have not been observed under all possible combinations of environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity without however any variance in genotype.

The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of Haflrest . These characteristics in combination distinguish Haflrest as a new and distinct plant 

Plants of the new differ primarily from plants of the parent K SAIKA001 in ray floret color as inflorescences of K SAIKA001 have yellow and subdued orange bi colored ray florets.

Plants of the new can be compared to plants of Haflpare disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side by side comparisons conducted in Okayama ken Japan plants of the new differed from plants of Haflpare in ray floret color as plants of Haflpare have deep orange and yellow bi colored ray florets.

Plants of the new can be compared to plants of Hafltibr disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side by side comparisons conducted in Okayama ken Japan plants of the new differed from plants of Hafltibr in plant size and ray floret color as plants of Hafltibr are more compact than plants of the new and have orange colored ray florets with orange red colored central and lateral stripes.

Plants of the new can be compared to plants of Hafltifrpu disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side by side comparisons conducted in Okayama ken Japan plants of the new differed from plants of Hafltifrpu in plant size and ray floret color as plants of Hafltifrpu are more compact than plants of the new and have orange and yellow bi colored ray florets.

Plants of the new can be compared to plants of Hafltufr disclosed in a U.S. Plant Patent application filed concurrently. In side by side comparisons conducted in Okayama ken Japan plants of the new differed from plants of Hafltufr in ray floret color as plants of Hafltufr have ray florets with dark orange colored centers and yellow to light yellow colored apices.

Plants of the new can also be compared to plants of Florbikano disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 25 087. In side by side comparisons conducted in Okayama ken Japan plants of the new differed from plants of Florbikano in the following characteristics 

The aforementioned photograph and following observations and measurements describe plants grown in 15 cm containers during October in a polyethylene covered greenhouse in Cartago Costa Rica and under cultural practices which approximate those generally used in commercial production. During the production of the plants day temperatures averaged 26 C. night temperatures averaged 18 C. and light levels ranged from 12 to 15 moles per day. Plants were pinched two times and were 21 weeks old when the photograph and description were taken. In the following description color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart 2007 Edition except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
