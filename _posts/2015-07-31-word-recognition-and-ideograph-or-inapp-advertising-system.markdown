abstract: A non-transitory processor readable medium storing processor executable instructions is described. The processor executable instructions, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to: receive application data indicative of text from a user device via a communications network; analyze the application data for one or more indicator being at least a portion of the text entered into the application and having one or more meaning; retrieve one or more selected ideograph from a database populated with ideographs received from and associated with one or more advertisers, the one or more selected ideograph being indicative of a graphical representation of the one or more meanings of the one or more indicator; transmit the one or more selected ideograph to the user device via the communications network; and charge a fee to at least one advertiser associated with the one or more selected ideograph.
