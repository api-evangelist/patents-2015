This disclosure relates in general to the field of communications and more particularly to a system and method to facilitate service hand outs using user equipment UE groups in a network environment.

Networking architectures have grown increasingly complex in communication environments. For example small cell radios have gained notoriety due to their capabilities to connect wireless devices to a network. In general terms small cell radios can operate in a licensed spectrum to connect user equipment to the network often using broadband connections. For a mobile operator small cell radios can offer improvements to both coverage and capacity which is particularly applicable to indoor networking environments where macro cell radio networks typically suffer coverage limitations. In some cases a service hand out may be needed from a serving cell radio does not support a service requested by a user equipment to a cell radio that supports the service. In some service hand outs delays occur during the time that a service hand out target is determined for a given user equipment requesting a particular service. Such delays can cause service hand out failures which can degrade network performance as well as user experience. Accordingly there are significant challenges in managing service hand outs for user equipment.

A method is provided in one example embodiment and may include grouping a plurality of user equipment served by a serving cell radio into one or more groups based on an approximate location of each of the plurality of user equipment and a proximity of each of the plurality of user equipment in relation to each other the serving cell radio providing a first service to the plurality of user equipment selecting a master user equipment for each group receiving from the master user equipment for each group inter frequency measurement information or inter Radio Access Technology RAT measurement information associated with one or more neighboring cell radios receiving a first service request for a first user equipment of a particular group wherein the first service request includes a request for a second service for the first user equipment and wherein the second service is not provided by the serving cell radio and selecting a particular neighboring cell radio for a service hand out of the first user equipment based at least in part on the first service request and inter frequency measurement information or inter RAT measurement information received from a particular master user equipment for the particular group.

In some instances grouping the plurality of user equipment served by the serving cell radio into one or more groups can further include enabling intra frequency measurement reporting for each user equipment served by the serving cell radio triangulating the approximate location of each of the plurality of user equipment based on intra frequency measurement information received from each of the plurality of user equipment for at least two intra frequency neighboring cell radios of each of the plurality of user equipment served by the serving cell radio and determining the proximity of each of the user equipment in relation to each other for grouping at least two user equipment in close proximity to each other into a group.

In some cases the method can include adjusting a size of a particular group of user equipment based on inter frequency measurement information or inter RAT measurement information received for a particular master user equipment for the particular group wherein the adjusting includes. In some instances the adjusting can include increasing the size of the particular group if the inter frequency measurement information or the inter RAT measurement information indicates a strong neighboring cell radio and decreasing the size of the particular group if the inter frequency measurement information or the inter RAT measurement information indicates a weak neighboring cell radio.

In some instances selecting a particular master user equipment for a particular group can further include determining a data rate for each user equipment for the particular group based on at least one of evaluating a number of quality of service QoS class identifiers QCIs for each user equipment wherein the number of QCIs for each user equipment is associated with the data rate for each user equipment and determining the data rate for each user equipment based on an assessment of one or more protocol layers of the serving cell radio. In other instances selecting the particular master user equipment for the particular group can further include comparing the data rate for each user equipment for the particular group to determine one or more candidate user equipment that can be selected as the particular master user equipment wherein the one or more candidate user equipment have lower data rates in comparison to other user equipment of the particular group and selecting the particular master user equipment from the one or more candidate user equipment which has the lowest data rate.

In still other instances selecting a particular master user equipment for a particular group can further include evaluating a modulation and coding scheme MCS order for each user equipment for the particular group to determine one or more candidate user equipment that can be selected as the master user equipment wherein the MCS is associated with a communication channel condition between the serving cell radio and each user equipment for the particular group and selecting the particular master user equipment from the one or more candidate user equipment which has the highest order MCS. In still other instances selecting the particular master user equipment for the particular group can further include selecting the master user equipment from the one or more candidate user equipment which has the highest order MCS and that is located at an approximate center of the particular group.

Another method is provided in another example embodiment and may include receiving by a serving cell radio feedback information for a master user equipment of a user equipment group wherein the feedback information includes position information associated one or more neighboring cell radios communicating at least in part the feedback information a size of the user equipment group and an identifier for the user equipment group to a Self Organizing Network SON server determining by the SON server management instructions associated with one or more operations to performed by the serving cell radio communicating the management instructions to the serving cell radio and performing by the serving cell radio the one or more operations associated with the management instructions.

In some instances the feedback information can include position information associated with the master user equipment which includes a cell identifier and a signal strength associated with each of the one or more neighboring cell radios. In some instances the management instructions can be associated with one or more operations to perform coordinated resource scheduling for user equipment in the user equipment group with one or more other user equipment groups associated with one or more corresponding neighboring cell radios. In some cases the coordinated scheduling can be performed through one or more operations including at least one of coordinating resources with the one or more other user equipment groups via an interface connecting the serving cell radio and the one or more corresponding neighboring cell radios and coordinating resources with the one or more other user equipment groups according to resource group allocations included in the management instructions from the SON server.

In still some instances the management instructions can include an identifier for each of the one or more other groups. In still some instances the management instructions can be associated with one or more operations to initiate handover of user equipment in the user equipment group to one or more neighboring cell radios. In still some instances communications from the serving cell radio to the SON server further include one or more of an available power headroom for the master user equipment an average data rate served to user equipment in the user equipment group an average uplink Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio SINR for the user equipment group and a downlink Block Error Rate BLER for user equipment in the user equipment group.

In some cases the other method can further include selecting the master user equipment for the user equipment group based on one of its location being at an approximate geographical center of the user equipment group if there are more than two user equipment in the user equipment group and its location being closest to the serving cell radio if there are only two user equipment in the user equipment group.

IP addresses can be assigned using dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP Stateless Address Auto configuration default bearer activation processes etc. or any suitable variation thereof.

In general macro cell radios can offer suitable connectivity to one or more UE e.g. UE via respective coverage areas for the macro cell radios for one or more radio access networks e.g. 4G LTE 3G 2G using any appropriate protocol or technique. Various example macro cell radio coverage areas are discussed in further detail herein in this Specification with respect to . For 4G LTE deployments macro cell radios can be deployed as evolved Node Bs interchangeably referred to as eNodeBs or eNBs and for 2G 3G deployments macro cell radios can be deployed as Node Bs interchangeably referred to as NodeBs or NBs .

In general eNodeBs for macro cell networks can be responsible for selecting a Mobility Management Entity MME not shown within mobile core network for session establishment for each UE for managing radio resources for each UE and making handover e.g. hand out decisions for UE . In general a NodeB can be deployed in combination with a Radio Network Controller RNC which can be included within or separate from NodeB equipment. For 2G 3G deployments the combination of NodeB RNC can perform similar functions as an eNodeB. In various embodiments for 2G 3G deployments one or more RNC s can be provided in communication system to serve macro cell radios each having NodeB capabilities.

In various embodiments small cell radio s can offer suitable connectivity to one or more UE e.g. UE via respective coverage areas for the small cell radios for one or more radio access networks using any appropriate protocol or technique.

In various embodiments small cell radio s can be dual stack radio devices which can be configured for example to provide both 4G LTE and WiFi connectivity or can be triple stack radio devices which can be configured for example to provide 4G LTE 3G 2G and WiFi connectivity. Thus in general terms small radio s can represent radio access devices that can allow UE to connect to a wired network using 4G 3G 2G WiFi WiMAX or any other appropriate standard.

Hence the broad term small cell radio can be inclusive of a wireless access point WAP a femtocell a hotspot a picocell a WiFi array a wireless bridge e.g. between networks sharing same Service Set Identifier SSID and radio channel a wireless local area network WLAN an HNB an HeNB or any other suitable access device or combination thereof which may be capable of providing suitable connectivity to one or more UE. In certain cases a given small cell radio can connect to a router via a wired network which can relay data between the UE and other UE of the network. Note as referred to herein in this Specification a small cell radio e.g. any small cell radio may also be referred to interchangeably as an HNB an HeNB a small cell a small cell access point a femtocell a femto or a picocell .

Small cell gateway may aggregate connectivity of small cell radios to mobile core network . In various embodiments small cell management system may be used to provision small cell radios according to one or more management or communication protocols and or data models. For example small cell management system can provision small cell radio according to technical report 069 TR 069 protocol using the TR 196 version 2 data model in at least one embodiment. In various embodiments small cell radios can be deployed in business e.g. enterprise environments within predefined clusters or grids that can be optimized to provide contiguous or overlapping cellular mobile coverage for enterprise users e.g. employees visitors etc. when such users are located within a coverage area of small cell radio deployed in such a cluster grid. Typically small cell radios operate at lower power levels as compared to macro cell radios to provide coverage in a business or residential environment e.g. within a building home etc. .

In various embodiments small cell management system can also be used to configure or manage grid or cluster information for groups of small cell radios including but not limited to configuring grid cluster identities IDs for different grids clusters configuring cell IDs for small cell radios e.g. local or global configuring physical layer identifiers e.g. primary scrambling code PSC physical cell identity PCI configuring location area code LAC routing area code RAC tracking area code TAC for small cell radios combinations thereof or the like.

Before detailing various operational aspects of it is important to understand common characteristics of service hand outs as generally provided in commercial architectures. The following foundation is offered earnestly for teaching purposes only and therefore should not be construed in any way to limit the broad teachings of the present disclosure.

A handover as generally referred to in commercial architectures typically occurs when service for a given UE is handed over from a source or serving cell radio to a destination or target cell radio. From the perspective of the source or serving cell radio the handover is viewed as a hand out of the UE and from the perspective of the destination or target cell radio the handover is viewed as a hand in of the UE.

In some cases handovers can be coverage or mobility based for example when a given UE transitions from the coverage area of a serving cell radio to the coverage area of another cell radio a handover may be performed from the serving cell radio to another cell radio. To perform such a mobility based handover the UE may provide its source or serving cell radio measurement reports which include signal strength information of neighboring cell radios. Based on the measurement reports the serving cell radio can initiate a handover to a particular destination cell radio having the strongest reported signal strength in the measurement reports. In some cases mobility based handovers can be intra frequency e.g. having a same carrier frequency handovers for between cell radios of a same Radio Access Technology RAT type e.g. 4G LTE cell radio to 4G LTE cell radio for a same carrier frequency or can be inter frequency e.g. having a different carrier frequency handovers between cell radios of same RAT type e.g. 4G LTE cell radio to 4G LTE cell radio for different carrier frequencies . In some cases coverage areas of particular RAT types may be limited or non existent altogether in which cases inter RAT handovers can be performed between cell radios e.g. between a 4G LTE cell radio and a 3G UMTS cell radio .

In other cases a given UE may request a certain service from its current RAN node e.g. source serving cell radio which the current RAN node cannot provide or does not support. In such cases the service request can trigger a service hand out for the UE from the current RAN node to a neighboring RAN node that can provide the service. The neighboring RAN node can be an inter frequency RAN node e.g. different carrier frequency for same RAT type or an inter RAT RAN node e.g. different RAT type depending on the service requested and the provisioning of the service in the RAN e.g. which cell radio s frequencies etc. are configured for providing the service . As referred to herein in this Specification the terms service hand out and service handover can be used interchangeably.

Performance requirements or metrics can be associated with service hand outs depending on the type of service for which a hand out is to be performed. In general performance metrics can be provided to ensure completion of a service hand out such that the service can be provided to UE. For example if a service hand out is needed for a given UE for a delay sensitive service such as a voice call or a video call the hand out can include a given time based performance metric which may indicate a time that is critical for the source node to be able to offload this service e.g. this UE to an appropriate destination node. Failure to do so within the stipulated time for the time based performance metric may result in either a service establishment time out e.g. call failure and or a user inconvenience. Consider for example if the service being offloaded is a voice emergency call in such a case the failure to offload the service within the stipulated time could have serious consequences to the user.

The problem of meeting such performance metrics is often aggravated in 4G LTE small cell ad hoc network deployments having an overlaid UMTS e.g. GSM access network in which circuit switched CS fall back CSFB is the method used to offload voice and video call services to UMTS GSM nodes. In a typical UMTS overlaid network there may be several cell radios around a given 4G LTE small cell radio and hence a measurement by a given UE seeking to initiate a voice or video call to determine the best cell radio for hand out is often needed. In cases in which the UMTS network is deployed as an ad hoc network it is even more important to select the best cell to offload a given UE as coverage and capacity of UMTS ad hoc networks can change dynamically.

A reliable service handover typically requires reliable UE measurements. However reliable UE measurements are often an overhead for service handovers and often cannot be accommodated a given UE requesting a service that is not provided by its current node. For example upon determining that its current node does not support a requested service for the UE there is typically a small time needed to trigger measurement reporting for the UE and therefore only a small window in which the UE can filter aberrations of signal strength measurements. Because there is only a small window in which to filter aberrations the UE could just report the first cell radio it sees which may not necessarily be the best cell radio to provide the service. To ensure that UE measurements are reliable would mean that UE would need sufficient time to perform reliable signal strength measurement and or any filtering which would delay the handover. One solution to this timing problem might include storing previous measurement reports for each UE however storing previous measurement reports would not be useful for ad hoc networks in which coverage and capacity can dynamically change. Further performing measurements by all the UEs in the system would reduce the performance of the system as inter frequency and inter RAT measurements typically involve measurement gaps e.g. gaps in transmission of measurement reports which can introduce additional handover delays.

In accordance with one embodiment communication system can overcome the aforementioned problems and others by providing a system and method to facilitate service hand outs for UE e.g. any of UE in a network environment using UE groups. In various embodiments communication system can provide a method for creating one or more clusters or groups of UE e.g. UE by a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio based at least in part on approximate UE locations and the proximity of each UE to each other e.g. UE positions within the coverage area of the serving cell radio selecting a master UE among each group to perform service hand out inter frequency and or inter RAT measurements for each group as a whole the other UE of the group can be considered follower UE using inter frequency and or inter RAT measurements from the master UE for a given group to accelerate handovers for follower UE of the group without the follower UE performing inter frequency or inter RAT measurements on their own. In general the master UE selected for each group can in various embodiments provide feedback information for each group which can be used to configure and or guide UE within the group for among other things service hand outs. In various embodiments the method provided by communication system can include managing the performance of each cluster or group e.g. how well a cluster or group provides for successful service handouts through various updates to the group e.g. adjusting the size of a group selecting a new master adjusting the periodicity of master UE measurements etc. .

In at least one embodiment the clusters or groups of UE can be created using location information for each UE which can be obtained using intra frequency measurements of at least two intra frequency neighboring cells and triangulating the approximate location for each UE within the coverage area of a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio . In various embodiments triangulation can include using received signal strength indication RSSI time difference of arrival TDOA combinations thereof or the like to determine an approximate location for each UE served by small cell radio . Based on the location of each UE serving small cell radio can determine the positions and proximity of each UE in relation to each other within its coverage area. In at least one embodiment the approximate location for each UE can be determined by monitoring geolocation events derived from Global Positioning System GPS information for each UE assuming each UE is configured with a corresponding GPS transceiver to receive transmit GPS information.

Consider an operational example in which each small cell radio is deployed as an intra frequency 4G LTE small cell radio e.g. HeNB each macro cell radio is deployed as a 3G macro cell radio e.g. NodeB and UE are served by small cell radio . In various embodiments the method provided by communication system can be based on various assumptions including that there are two or more intra frequency neighbors for a serving source cell note having two or more intra frequency neighbors is typically a pre requisite for determining approximate UE location using triangulation that there is enough UE density in the neighborhood vicinity of a small cell radio coverage area e.g. there are multiple UE in the coverage area that UE receiver performance does not vary much among UEs of different make and or vendor and or that the coverage from cells used for guiding service handouts for groups may not have sharp drops for example the coverage should be such that the signal strength of a given cell can be assumed to be approximately constant with small changes in distance.

During operation for example the method provided by communication system can include small cell radio enabling UE to perform intra frequency measurements e.g. same carrier frequency but different cell identity ID for intra frequency small cell neighbors e.g. any of small cell radios . Enabling intra frequency measuring can trigger intra frequency measurement reporting for UE in which each UE may communicate an intra frequency measurement report according to a configured periodicity to serving small cell radio . Using the intra frequency measurement report s received from UE small cell radio can perform a triangulation for each UE to determine an approximate location of each UE within the coverage area of small cell radio . Based on the approximate location of each UE small cell radio can determine a fair or approximate estimation of the distribution of UEs within its coverage area as well as the proximity of each UE to each other within its coverage area. The proximity of each UE can provide at least one basis for grouping UE into one or more UE groups.

In at least one embodiment intra frequency measurement reports can include Reference Signal Received Power RSRP signal strength information as defined in 3GPP standards for neighboring cell radios e.g. two or more of small cell radios and serving source small cell radio to locate the position of each UE in the coverage area of small cell radio . In another embodiment intra frequency measurement reports can include Reference Signal Received Quality RSRQ signal strength information as defined in 3GPP standards for neighboring and source cell radios. In yet another embodiment intra frequency measurement reports can include common pilot channel CPICH energy per chip to total interference Ec Io as defined in 3GPP standards for neighboring and source cell radios. In yet another embodiment intra frequency measurement reports can include Received Signal Code Power RSCP as defined in 3GPP standards for neighboring and source cell radios.

In at least one embodiment small cell radio can select or group UE into one or more groups based at least in part on their proximity to each other as can be determined using the RSRP readings present in each UE s measurement report for the cells used in the triangulation. In various embodiments cells used in triangulation of UE location position can be selected based on signal strength information e.g. RSRP RSRQ RSCP CPICH Ec Io etc. included in intra frequency measurement reporting for each UE. For example it at least one embodiment a serving cell radio may select the top two highest signal strength intra frequency neighbors in combination with the received signal strength for the serving cell in order to triangulate the positions and proximity of UE to each other within the coverage area of the serving cell.

Consider for the present example that RSRP readings e.g. signal strength information for small cell radios and or small cell radios and can be used in triangulating the locations of UE and determining their positions in proximity to each other within the coverage area of small cell radio in order to group UE into a first UE group shown in as UE Group based on their location in proximity to each other. Similarly RSRP signal strength information for small cell radio and can be used in triangulating the of UE and determining their positions in proximity to each other within the coverage area of small cell radio in order to group UE into a second UE group shown in as UE Group based on the location in proximity to each other. In various embodiments a UE group should consist of at least two UE.

Following the grouping of UE into UE Group and UE into UE Group small cell radio may choose a master UE for each group. The rest of the UE not selected as the master in each group may become followers for each group. A master UE chosen for a UE group may bear the responsibility to provide feedback information for the group such as for example performing intended service hand out measurements e.g. measuring a target inter frequency and or a target inter RAT to guide service handovers for all UE in the UE group. In some cases a higher density of UEs in a group may imply a higher number of followers for the group which can in various embodiments lead to a reduced overall cost of service hand out measurements as less UEs served by a given cell radio may bear the added responsibility of being a master.

As referred to herein in this Specification a master UE for a given UE group can be referred to using a UE label. In various embodiments one or more UE characteristics can be considered in selecting a master UE for a group including but not limited to UE location within a group UE and or UE data rate. In at least one embodiment a given UE which is determined to be at approximately the center of a given group e.g. whose position location with respect to other UE in the group has been determined using intra frequency measurements can be chosen as the master UE to provide feedback information e.g. service hand out measurements for the group in order to guide the group for service handovers. For example during operation UE can be selected by small cell radio as the master UE for UE Group e.g. UE based at least in part on its location being at approximately the center of UE Group in relation to other UE of the group. Thus UE can be considered follower UE for UE Group .

In another embodiment a data rate for each UE in a group in combination with a position location of each UE in proximity to each other in the group can be used to determine a master UE for the group. As service measurement reporting may be extra overhead for UE operation and may also result in measurement gaps for UE operation it may be advantageous to determine UE in a given UE group having a lower data rates in comparison to other UE in the UE group. In various embodiments one or more low data rate UE in a UE group can be flagged as candidate UE for selection as a master UE.

In at least one embodiment the location of candidate UE can be assessed to determine one or more candidate UE at an approximate center of the group having lower data rates in comparison to other UE of the group and from these candidate UE a master UE can be selected having the lowest data rate that is at an approximate center of the group.

In another embodiment data rate alone for each UE in a group can be used to determine a master UE for the group. In some cases a UE group may consist of only two UE such as for example UE Group including UE . In such cases determining a UE at approximately the center of the group may be difficult to determine. Accordingly data rate alone can be used to determine a master UE for a group. It is assumed for purposes of the present operational example that UE has been selected as the master UE for UE Group e.g. UE 

In various embodiments a data rate for each UE in a group can be inferred using one or more techniques to determine one or more candidate UE in the group for possible selection as a master UE. In at least one embodiment a number of QoS Class Identifiers QCIs configured for each UE in a group can be evaluated to infer the data rate of each UE in the group. Typically a UE is configured with a default bearer upon attaching to a given cell radio. The default bearer may have associated thereto a given QCI. However if any additional specific traffic is configured for the UE other QCIs can be configured for the traffic. For example Voice over LTE VoLTE traffic may have associated therewith a QCI 1 Session Initiation Protocol SIP traffic may have associated therewith a QCI 5 and so on for other traffic that can be configured for a UE. As additional QCIs can be associated with additional traffic for a given UE the number of QCIs for each UE in a group can be considered to infer a data rate for each UE in the group according to one embodiment such that a fewer number of QCIs can be associated with a lower data rate for a given UE. In this manner candidate UE having lower data rates in comparison to other UE of a group can be determined for possible selection as a master UE for the group.

In at least one embodiment an assessment of data packets associated with each UE of a group for one or more protocol layers of a serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio can be evaluated to infer a data rate for each UE of the group. Generally cell radios can include a transmitter and a receiver each including various protocol layers associated with communicating data to and from UE. In various embodiments the protocol layers can include a Packet Data Convergence Protocol PDCP layer a Radio Link Control RLC layer a Media Access Control MAC layer and a physical PHY layer. Each layer may operate on data packets that are to be transmitted to UE or that are received from UE. Typically the PDCP layer can provide for packet compression decompression transfer of user data etc. the RLC layer can provide for error correction transfer of packet data units PDUs segmentation etc. the MAC layer can provide for packet scheduling and the PHY layer can provide an over the air interface for communicating packets to UE. The MAC layer can additionally include a buffer which may provide for buffering packets that are to be transmitted to UE or that are received from UE. In at least one embodiment a data rate for each UE can be determined based on data rate at the PDCP layer for downlink data e.g. data to be transmitted to each UE and or MAC buffer occupancy for uplink data e.g. data received from each UE in order to determine one or more candidate UE having lower data rates in comparison to other UE of the group for possible selection as a master UE for the group.

In at least one embodiment a Modulation and Coding Scheme MCS selected for each UE of a group can be used to infer radio conditions for each UE for each UE of the group. In various embodiments an MCS can be associated with a modulation type including but not limited to Binary Phase Shift Keying BPSK Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM and variations thereof such as for example 16QAM 64QAM etc. Each modulation type can be associated with a modulation order which can proceed in an increasing manner from BPSK to QPSK and further through QAM 16QAM 64QAM etc. Generally a MCS is chosen for communications with a given UE based on radio communication conditions with the UE. For better radio conditions with a given UE e.g. UE for example a higher order MCS can be selected which can be associated with a higher potential data throughput rate for the UE. Thus in at least one embodiment MCS order can also be used as an indicator through which radio conditions for each UE in a group can be inferred. As inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement reporting for a given master UE can erode uplink bandwidth for the master UE e.g. communications from the UE to the serving cell radio one or more candidate UE for a group can be determined for possible selection as a master UE for the group in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure such that higher order MCS values can be associated with higher available uplink bandwidth for inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement reporting.

In addition to inferences based on MCS order the MCS for a given UE coupled with a number of physical resource blocks allocated to the UE e.g. for uplink and downlink communications can be used to additionally infer channel conditions for the UE. Per 3GPP standards a physical resource block PRB can be used to communicate resources to from one or more UE in a cell. Resources can include control resource and data resources. A PRB is comprised of a number of resource elements each of which can be allocated within a symbol for each of a particular subcarrier e.g. frequency which can be associated with a given UE.

The smallest unit of a PRB is a resource element which represents one subcarrier by one symbol. Each PRB or slot can include six 6 or seven 7 symbols depending on cyclic prefix configuration. For 4G LTE the number of subcarriers for a PRB is 12 each spanning a 15 kilohertz 15 KHz bandwidth . Each resource element for each symbol of a PRB can be represented using a number of bits which can vary depending on the MCS selected for communications. For example for a 64QAM 6 bits symbol can be used for 16QAM four 4 bits symbol can be used for QPSK two 2 bits symbol can be used and so on depending on MCS selected for communications with a given UE.

Generally the number of PRBs allocated to a UE is a function of the data rate and channel conditions for the UE. For example a low data rate UE can be allocated more PRBs for communications if it is using a lower modulation order and a lower coding rate as this may help to protect data for the communications against loss due to noisy channel conditions. Thus channel conditions for a UE can also be inferred based on both the number of PRBs and MCS for the UE. In at least one embodiment determining UE in a UE group that have a lower order MCS in combination with having a high number of PRBs allocated thereto can be used to exclude such UE as candidate UE for possible selection as a master UE for the UE group.

As noted above measurement gaps can occur for intra frequency measurement reporting performed by a given UE when the UE switches frequencies and or RATs to perform inter frequency and or inter RAT measurements. In at least one embodiment since intended inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement might result in measurement gaps a given UE chosen to be the master of a given group should be such that its services e.g. services provided by a current serving source cell may not be affected by measurement gaps. In various embodiments inferring the data rate for each UE of a group based on a number of QCIs configured for each UE and or determining the data rate for each UE of a group based on PDCP data rate and MAC buffer occupancy can be used for master UE selection such that a selected master UE may have moderate to low data rates in comparison to other UE of the group. However as channel conditions can also impact the data rate for UE determining MCS order and or MCS order in combination with data rate for each UE in a group can be used for master UE selection such that a selected master UE may have a higher order MCS and or a higher order MCS in combination with moderate to low data rates in comparison to other UE of the group.

In various embodiments a given cell radio e.g. small cell radio can store grouping information for one or more UE groups created by the cell radio for identifying each UE group. In various embodiments grouping information for a UE group can include but not be limited to an identity of each UE group e.g. 1 2 3 etc. identifying information for each UE within a UE group e.g. International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity TMSI or any other local or global identity location information for each UE in a UE group master UE identifying information for a UE group e.g. which UE is the current master UE follower UE identifying information for a group feedback information e.g. measurement report s etc. for the master UE for a UE group combinations thereof or the like.

Returning to the operational example in which UE has been selected as the master UE for UE Group and UE has been selected as the master UE for UE Group small cell radio can enable measurement reporting for each selected master UE of each UE group for an intended measurement quantity e.g. RSRP RSRQ RSCP CPICH Ec Io etc. for one or more target frequency and or target RAT measurements of any neighboring cell radios that may provide services for potential service hand outs for the UE of each group. In various embodiments a service hand out measurement report for a given master UE selected for a group can include for each corresponding cell radio measured by the master UE a value for the intended measurement quantity e.g. as set by the serving cell radio and a corresponding cell identifier ID for each cell radio measured by the master UE. In various embodiments a cell ID can be a Physical Cell Identity PCI for 4G LTE cell radios Physical Primary Scrambling Code PSC for 3G UMTS cell radios or any other cell ID configured for cell radios of communication system .

In various embodiments an intended measurement quantity and target inter frequency and or target inter RAT measurement selected for a master UE can be as chosen by a network operator and or service provider. For example in at least one embodiment a configuration of what services may be provided supported in communication system as well as what frequency or frequencies and or RAT type s through which corresponding services may be provided supported can be configured for small cell radios and or macro cell radios by a network operator and or service provider. In various embodiments small cell radios and or macro cell radios can be configured to store such information for use in setting target inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement reporting for an intended measurement quantity for each master UE chosen for each group. In various embodiments an intended measurement quantity could be RSRP and or RSRQ measurements of a target frequency for inter frequency neighboring cell radios or could be a measurement quantity intended for inter RAT neighboring cells such as for example RSCP and or CPICH Ec Io measurements of neighboring 3G UMTS cell s . For the present example in which macro cell radios may be deployed as 3G UMTS macro cell radios to provide one or more CSFB services e.g. voice video etc. measurement reporting can be enabled for master UE for UE Group and master UE for UE Group for each master UE to perform RSCP measurements for a targeted RAT type set to 3G UMTS.

In one embodiment small cell radio can store measurement reports for each respective master UE and UE in order to determine a best cell radio to receive a service hand out for any corresponding UE of each of respective UE Group and UE Group for one or more CSFB services that may be requested by any UE for each group. It should be noted that service hand outs for each UE in a group can be performed for the master UE of the group as well as any follower UE of the group depending on the particular UE requesting a particular service that may be provided by a cell other than the serving cell radio for the group.

In one embodiment when a given UE in a group requires a service handover e.g. a service request for the service is received by its serving cell radio then the serving cell radio can use stored measurement s from the master UE for the group to determine the best neighboring cell to receive the service handover of the given UE. For example assume a service request is received from UE in UE Group for a service provided by neighboring macro cell radios . Upon receiving the service request from UE small cell radio can retrieve the service measurement report s received from master UE and perform a look up on the report to determine the best neighboring cell radio to receive the service hand out for UE . In the present example the service measurement report received from master UE may indicate macro cell radio as the best neighboring cell radio to receive the service hand out e.g. UE Group is nearest to macro cell radio thus its signal strength was likely measured as a strong neighbor by UE . In some cases if the UE for which handover is requested performed is the master UE of the group then another UE can be chosen as a new master UE for the group using any of the techniques described herein.

As target inter frequency inter RAT measurement s can be periodic in nature and as users UE can be mobile within communication system the selection of a master UE for groups as well as the configuration of groups e.g. size measurement reporting rate etc. can be adapted throughout operation to manage the performance for each group e.g. how well a group provides for successful service handouts . In various embodiments a cluster or group s performance can be kept reliable by dividing it into smaller groups and or adjusting the periodicity intra frequency inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement reporting to constantly or nearly constantly assess the performance of the group via the reports of master and followers. Features related to assessing and or managing the performance of groups may be better understood with reference to the coverage areas of neighboring cells e.g. macro cell radios which are shown in further detail in .

Referring to is a simplified block diagram illustrating additional details that can be associated with one potential embodiment of communication system . includes RAN small cell radio UE and macro cell radios . A coverage area dashed line circle is shown for macro cell radio and another coverage area dashed line circle is shown for macro cell radio . As shown in the coverage area for macro cell radio can overlap a portion of the coverage area for small cell radio that includes UE for UE Group . Also shown the coverage area for macro cell radio can overlap and a portion of the coverage area for small cell radio that includes UE for UE Group .

It should be understood that the size shape etc. of the coverage areas for small cell radio and macro cell radios are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not meant to limit the broad scope of the teachings of the present disclosure. Any coverage area for any cell radio small and or macro can be provided within the scope of the teachings of the present disclosure. Note small cell radios are not shown in RAN for in order to illustrate other features of communication system however it should be understood that operations described with respect to RAN as shown in may apply equally to the configuration of RAN as shown in .

In various embodiments assessing or measuring the performance of a group and its master UE can be performed using the service hand out measurement report s for a target frequency RAT selected for the master UE. Based on the service measurement report s e.g. for a target inter frequency inter RAT type received from a current master UE of a UE group a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio can ascertain how well the current master UE for a UE Group e.g. UE for UE Group and or UE for UE Group may be in guiding follower UE for the group. In one embodiment if the service measurement reports from the master UE of a UE group indicates a strong neighboring cell radio e.g. strong signal strength then the size of the group e.g. number of UE in the group can be increased. For example if the master UE for a group reports strong inter frequency and or inter RAT neighboring cell radio measurements this may indicate that it is close to a neighboring cell radio and hence the master UE could accommodate more followers or serve its current followers satisfactorily. In some embodiments determination of a strong neighboring cell radio can be based on a comparison of the intended quantity for service hand out measurements against one or more high signal strength thresholds. In some embodiments multiple signal strength measurement thresholds can be used to infer a relative strength of multiple neighboring cell radios that may be measured by one or more groups served by a given serving cell radio.

As shown in UE Group including UE may be indicative of a group whose size can be large or may even be further increased in size to accommodate more followers as it is likely that master UE may report strong service hand out measurements for macro cell radio because master UE is near the interior of the coverage area for macro cell radio

In some cases upon determining that a strong neighbor is seen by a particular master UE of a particular group the serving cell radio may in certain embodiments check the area near the particular group to determine if any neighboring groups could be annexed into a single large group including the particular master UE. In one embodiment the intended quantity for service hand out measurement reports e.g. inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement reports can be compared against one or more high signal strength threshold levels which the serving cell radio may use to determine whether or not to attempt to annex any neighboring UE groups into a single large group and or to determine an approximate number of UE to attempt to annex into the single large group. In another embodiment the serving cell radio could make the determination of whether or not to attempt to annex and or a number of UE to attempt to annex into a single large group based on one or more high signal strength threshold level comparisons in combination with an evaluation of the location of the UE in any neighboring groups.

In another embodiment if service measurement report s from a current master UE of a UE group indicates a weak neighboring cell radio e.g. weak signal strength then the current master for the group could be changed or updated in an effort to select another master for the group having reporting stronger service measurements for a target inter frequency inter RAT type of a neighboring cell radio. In various embodiments the selection and or re selection of a master UE for a UE group can be repeated until a good master e.g. having the strongest service measurement reports for the target frequency RAT type is found for the UE group. In yet another embodiment if service measurement report s from a current master UE of a UE group indicates a weak neighboring cell radio then the size of the group can be decreased by dividing the group into several smaller groups and selecting a new master UE for each smaller UE group. In yet another embodiment if service measurement report s from a current master UE of a UE group indicates a weak neighboring cell radio then the size of the group could be decreased by shedding some of the follower UE from the periphery of the group in which case another master UE could be selected for the decreased size group. In various embodiments UE shed from the periphery of a group can be re selected into one or more other groups depending at least in part on their proximity in relation to each other as determined from intra frequency measurement reports for the UE. In some embodiments determination of a weak neighboring cell radio can be based on a comparison of the intended quantity for service hand out measurements against one or more low signal strength thresholds.

As shown in UE Group may be indicative of a group whose size can be small or may accommodate less followers e.g. down to a minimum group size of two UE and whose master UE may be updated in an effort to select another master UE for the group that may be a better leader for the group. As shown in UE and UE are at the edge of the coverage area for macro cell radio . Consider for example that upon grouping UE and UE into UE Group and selecting UE as the initial master UE for UE Group that master UE may report weak service measurements e.g. lower than one or more low signal strength thresholds to small cell radio for neighboring macro cell radio . In an effort to select a better master UE for UE Group serving small cell radio may also enable service measurements for UE for the target RAT e.g. 3G UMTS for UE Group . As UE may be closer in proximity to macro cell radio it can be assumed that the service measurements for UE may be higher than the service measurements for UE in which case serving cell radio can update the master UE selection for UE Group to be UE . Accordingly master UE for UE Groups can be selected and re selected to improve the performance of UE groups.

Since groups can be fluidic in nature e.g. due to movement of users UEs and or changes in radio conditions of an ad hoc network group dynamics may also be accounted for in order to assess and or manage the performance of groups. For example if a particular follower UE in a particular group changes location the proximate location of the UE in relation to the particular group can be re evaluated in various embodiments to determine whether the follower UE may need to be deleted from an existing group added to another existing group and or added into an altogether new group e.g. update grouping information for UE Groups . In various embodiments the determination of grouping or re grouping UE may not cause any additional signaling overhead for the method provided by communication system as this is a logical segregation. However if a master UE of a particular group moves its location then the proximate location of the UE in relation to the particular group can be re evaluated in various embodiments to determine whether a new master UE should be chosen for the group. In various embodiments this may result in a signaling overhead of deleting any existing service measurement reporting for the old master UE and enabling new service measurement reporting for a newly selected master.

In some embodiments in case there is a failure to form a UE group for a given UE e.g. the UE could not be grouped with a second UE then the UE may not trigger the pre emptive service measurement techniques used in the method provided by communication system . Instead for UE that cannot be selected into a group such UE may in certain embodiments attempt to measure the service neighbors as and when a given service is requested of them. Accordingly in some cases the method provided by communication system may be error prone as there may exist a possibility that a service hand out for a service hand out candidate may fail due to movement of follower UE or a master UE of a UE group from their previously triangulated position. In such cases if a service handover e.g. hand out fails then the candidate should fall back to the conventional method of measuring a given service frequency RAT.

In some cases there could be regions within the coverage area of a cell radio where there may be frequent failures due to rapid changing environment e.g. for an ad hoc deployment or frequent UE movement. For example for hallways and or elevators within a structure there may be frequent UE movement as people migrate about the structure. Thus in various embodiments cell radios in communication system may be configured to maintain a memory for flagging regions that experience failures due to a rapidly changing environment e.g. cells being added removed turned on off having fluctuating coverage areas etc. and or frequent UE movement. In various embodiments the performance of groups within such regions and overall robustness of the system may be increased by employing techniques such as grouping UE into smaller groups for such regions and or lowering the periodicity of measurements e.g. decreasing the time between measurements for groups lying in such regions. For example decreasing the size of groups and or increasing triangulation measurement periodicity e.g. lowering the time between such measurements could increase the success rate of service hand outs for such regions in various embodiments.

However some regions may experience very high UE movement such as for example corridors that lead to from exits entrances in which people are often entering or leaving a structure. By flagging regions having very high UE movement a given serving cell radio may determine in certain embodiments that no groups should be formed in such regions. In various embodiments one or more regions of high very high movement having a rapidly changing environment having high interference etc. can be flagged and or identified using GPS coordinates a coverage map facility map etc. configured by a network operator and or service provider which may be used by a given cell radio in managing the performance of UE groups within regions.

Additionally the method provided by communication system could be used at cell boundaries in various embodiments if there are sufficient low profile UEs e.g. UEs having a low data rate good channel conditions etc. selected as master UEs for various groups available for measuring neighboring cell radios for mobility handover purposes. By sufficient it is meant that there are enough UE at various edges of the coverage area of a serving cell radio such that the edges or boundaries of the coverage area are sufficiently covered by low profile UE communicating measurement reports to the serving cell radio. With sufficient coverage at the edges of the coverage area of the serving cell radio measurement reports from the low profile UE can be used in some embodiments to reduce the time of performing mobility based handovers when UE move out of the coverage area of the serving cell radio. In various embodiments these low profiles UEs e.g. master UEs could be configured to perform both Automatic Neighbor Relation ANR measurements as well as inter frequency measurements at cell boundaries for mobility handover purposes. In various embodiments neighbor relationships between neighboring cell radios within communication system can be managed using the ANR measurements performed by such low profile UEs.

Accordingly in various embodiments various advantages may be achieved using the method provided by communication system . For example most of the smart phones these days are data intensive and are always or almost always connected. Based on an assumption of constant or nearly constant connection would mean that when a device seeks a service it is likely that the service is already in a packet call. Thus it is likely that the serving cell radio for the device already has some measurements for the device that can be used for triangulation of the device that could be used to provide a quick service handover for the device whether the device is either already in a group or just near a group for which service measurements have been performed. However if a UE attaches to a given cell radio merely for the purpose of accessing a service which the cell radio does not support then the method provided by communication system may be less beneficial. In such cases conventional measurement reporting for service handovers may be employed.

As noted above for conventional service handovers a given UE typically has to be configured to measure a neighboring cell and in order to provide reliable measurements should be given sufficient time to filter any aberration in this measurement. The measurement report is then communicated to the UE s serving cell to trigger the service handover for the UE. Generally this process can take a few seconds which for some services e.g. voice video etc. could be detrimental to the service and or cause the service handover to fail altogether. In various embodiments by selecting a master UE for a UE group to perform service measurements for all UE in the UE group the method provided by communication system could cut the needed time to configure such measurement reporting as well as the time needed to wait for a measurement report which could improve reliability and or robustness for service handovers within the communication system.

As intra frequency measurement reporting of neighbors is often performed by UE the method provided by communication system may provide another advantage in that the method may not introduce additional overhead for triangulating a position of UE. However in environments in which UEs may be sparsely distributed using the method provided by communication system may result in many master UEs being selected to perform inter frequency and or inter RAT measurements thereby introducing the possibility of many UE in the environment having measurement gaps in their intra frequency measurement reporting which could impact system performance.

In some embodiments when implementing the method provided by communication system the measurement reporting occasion e.g. period for a given service frequency and or service RAT measurement and a given intra frequency measurement should be configured to be close to each other in time. Otherwise triangulation operations for determining UE positions using intra frequency measurements could result in a stale repot e.g. a stale group to be chosen for a service handover. However this problem can be overcome in at least one embodiment by continuously or nearly continuously assessing the performance of UE group s using any of the techniques described herein and selecting a periodicity that more closely aligns the measurement reporting occasions. In at least one embodiments inter frequency and or inter RAT service measurement reporting and intra frequency measurement reporting can be configured for a given UE using a single message e.g. a Radio Resource Control RRC reconfiguration message as defined in 3GPP standards which can be communicated to a given master UE of a given UE group.

Other advantages can be realized using the method provided by communication system . For example in cases in which an intended service provider may have cell radios as part of an ad hoc network merely storing previous service measurement reports for all UE in the system may not be useful. In an ad hoc network e.g. small cell deployment the radio environment may be rapidly changing which could result in constant monitoring being needed for service neighbors. In various embodiments the method provided by communication system may be beneficial for use in ad hoc networks as service measurement reports could be periodically e.g. as set by a network operator and or service provider for one or more UE groups thereby providing an updated view of the RAN topology and or user distribution of the system. By offloading the monitoring to a less loaded UE the performance of communication system may be increased.

In various embodiments the method provided by communication system could also provide benefits when used in networks that are more static in nature. In environments in which inter frequency and or inter RAT service providing nodes are also static in nature the method provided by communication system could still be used to assess the quality of such nodes. In some embodiments the method provided by communication system could be used to determine loading of neighboring cells in order to determine a best suited e.g. less loaded cell for service handovers. For example in various embodiments for inter frequency LTE cells RSRQ measurements could be used and for inter frequency 3G UMTS cells CPICH Ec Io measurements could be used to determine a best suited cell for service handovers.

Further small cells are often deployed in areas that experience pedestrian traffic in which increased speed for service handovers may be a requirement for successful handovers. In various embodiments the method provided by communication system may be ideally suited for coffee house deployments of small cells where the user environment is pedestrian or closely static in nature and expected to have significant user density. In such pedestrian or closely static environments in which UEs may be densely located in close proximity to each other the method provided by communication system may provide reduced signaling overhead for service handovers as it may be possible to group many UE followers into a group guided by a selected master UE. The signaling overhead that would otherwise be consumed by the UE followers can be removed from the system using the method provided by communication system in which the master UE for the group may perform service measurements for the group as a whole.

Turning to are simplified schematic diagrams illustrating example details associated with an example use case in which a given master UE leaves a given UE Group in accordance with one potential embodiment of communication system . includes users operating UE within a UE Group in which UE has been selected by a cell radio serving UE as a master UE for UE Group e.g. UE in one embodiment based on for example UE being at an approximate center of UE Group . The serving cell radio is not shown in in order to illustrate other features of communication system however it should be understood that any small cell radio or any macro cell radio as shown in can be the serving cell radio for UE . UE UE UE UE UE UE and UE may be indicated as followers for UE Group for the serving cell radio. In it is assumed that master UE moves its location which results in UE being out of the proximity with UE UE UE UE UE UE and UE .

Based on a determination that master UE has exited UE Group the remaining follower UE for UE Group can be re grouped into one or more groups based on their proximity to each other and a new master UE can be selected for each of the one or more groups using the method provided by communication system . illustrates example UE groupings including a UE Group including UE and UE a UE Group including UE and UE and a UE Group including UE and UE . In various embodiments UE and UE can be grouped into UE Group based on their proximity to each other UE and UE can be grouped into UE Group based on their proximity to each other and UE and UE can be grouped into UE Group based on their proximity to each other.

As discussed herein the method provided by communication system may include selecting a new master UE for each new UE group. As shown in UE can be selected as a master UE for UE Group and UE may be a follower UE for the group UE can be selected as a master UE for UE Group and UE may be a follower UE for the group and UE can be selected as a master UE for UE Group and UE may be a follower UE for the group. Accordingly in various embodiments the method provided by communication system can provide for dividing a large UE group e.g. UE Group into one or more smaller UE groups e.g. UE Groups and and selecting new masters for the groups in response to changing group dynamics such as for example a master UE e.g. UE leaving its group.

In some embodiments it may not be possible to group certain UE in communication system into a group because at least in part the UE may not be in proximity to other UE. As shown in UE may not be in proximity to the other UE that were in UE Group thus UE may be ungrouped following the exit of UE from UE Group . In at least one embodiment conventional service measurement techniques can be used for ungrouped UE in communication system . In some embodiments cell radios in communication system may be configured to track mobility events for UE in order to determine whether UE may be considered a high mobility UE or a low mobility UE in comparison to other UE in the system. In some embodiments mobility e.g. high or low may be an additional factor taken into consideration when selecting a master UE for a group. In other embodiments mobility may be an additional factor taken into consideration when grouping UE into one or more groups. In such embodiments it may be beneficial to exclude high mobility UEs from groups as these UE may cause frequent master UE re selections as the UE transitions between different groups thereby changing the organization of such groups.

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations associated with grouping UE into one or more UE groups in accordance with one potential embodiment of communication system . In one or more embodiments operations can be performed by a given small cell radio e.g. any small cell radio or a given macro cell radio e.g. any macro cell radio that may be serving one or more UE e.g. UE in order to facilitate grouping UE served by the cell radio into one or more groups and selecting a master UE for each group.

At any time a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio can group and or re group UE e.g. UE connected to the serving cell radio into one or more UE group s . Accordingly at the operations can include determining an approximate location of UE s connected to the serving cell radio. In at least one embodiment determining the location of each UE can include enabling intra frequency measurement reporting for each UE served by the serving cell radio and triangulating the approximate location of each of the UE based on intra frequency measurement information received from each of the UE for at least two intra frequency neighboring cell radios.

At the operations can include determining the proximity of each UE in relation to other UE connected to the serving cell radio based on the approximate location of each UE. In various embodiments the operations at can be used to determine a distribution of UEs within the coverage area of the cell radio as well as the proximity of each UE in relation to one another other within the coverage area. At the operations can include grouping the UE into one or more UE groups based at least in part on the proximity of each UE in relation to other UE connected to the serving cell radio such that each UE group includes at least two UE in proximity to each other. At the operations can include selecting for each UE group a master UE to provide feedback information for each UE group and the operations may end.

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations associated with selecting a master UE for a given UE group. In one or more embodiments operations can be performed by a given small cell radio e.g. any small cell radio or a given macro cell radio e.g. any macro cell radio that may be serving one or more UE e.g. UE in order to facilitate selecting a master UE for each group.

At any time a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio can group and or re group UE e.g. UE connected to the serving cell radio into one or more UE group s and can select a master UE for each group. Thus it is assumed that the approximate location and proximity of each UE in relation to each other is known for operations for each UE connected to the serving cell radio. For selecting a master UE for a particular UE group the operations can begin at in which the serving cell radio can determine a data rate for each UE in the particular group. In various embodiments determining the data rate for each UE in the particular UE group can include one or more of evaluating a number of quality of service QoS class identifiers QCIs for configured for each UE in which the number of QCIs configured for each UE is associated with its data rate determining the data rate for each UE based on an assessment of one or more protocol layers of the serving cell radio and or inferring channel conditions for each UE based on a modulation and coding scheme MCS and or a number of physical resource blocks allocated to each UE.

At the operations can include comparing the data rate for each UE to determine one or more candidate UE that can be selected as the master UE. Each corresponding candidate UE may have a corresponding data rate that is lower in comparison to other UE in the UE group. At the operations can include determining a number of UE in the UE group. At the operations can include determining if there are more than two UE in the UE group. If there are not more than two UE in the UE group the operations can continue to in which the master UE can be selected from the candidate UE that has the lowest data rate and the operations may end. If there are more than two UE in the UE group the operations can continue to in which the master UE can be selected from the candidate UE that has the lowest data rate and that is located at an approximate geographical center of the UE group as determined using the approximate location of each UE determined via intra frequency measurement reporting. At the operations can include assigning an ID to the UE group and at the operations can include relating each UE in the UE group to the ID for the UE group and the operations may end.

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations associated with adjusting a size of a UE group in accordance with one potential embodiment of communication system . In various embodiments the size of a given UE group can be increased or decreased to manage performance of the UE group. As discussed herein large UE groups can lead to increased system performance as signaling overhead can be reduced when densely populated UE in an area can benefit from service measurements of a single master UE providing feedback information for the group as a whole.

In one or more embodiments operations can be performed by a given small cell radio e.g. any small cell radio or a given macro cell radio e.g. any macro cell radio that may be serving one or more UE in order to facilitate grouping UE served by the cell radio into one or more groups and selecting a master UE for each group. At any time a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio can adjust the size of a UE group in order to manage performance of the group for service hand outs. Accordingly at the operations can include receiving by the serving cell radio service measurement information from a master UE of a UE group for one or more neighboring cell radio s . In various embodiments the service measurement information can include target inter frequency and or inter RAT measurements for an intended measurement quantity e.g. RSRP RSRQ RSCP CPICH Ec Io etc. for one or more neighboring cell radio s which may provide services not supported by the serving cell radio.

At the operations can include comparing the service measurement information to one or more thresholds e.g. signal strength thresholds in order to determine the signal strength of the one or more neighboring cell radio s as measured by the master UE. At the operations can include determining if the master UE is near one or more strong neighboring cell radio s based on the comparison at to the one or more thresholds. If it is determined that the master UE is near at least one strong neighboring cell radio the operations can include determining if there are other UE in proximity to the UE group e.g. using intra frequency triangulation etc. at . If it is determined at that no other UE are in proximity to the UE group the operations may end. However if it is determined that there are other UE in proximity to the group the operations can include adding the other UE to the UE group at to increase the size of the UE group. In some embodiments the operations can include selecting at a new master UE for the group using one or more of the master UE selection techniques described herein in the present disclosure.

Recalling the comparison at if it subsequently determined at that there are no strong neighboring cell radio s e.g. they are weak neighbor s near the master UE for the UE group the operations can include determining at if there are more than two UE in the UE group. Recall a UE group should include at least two UE. If it is determine that there are not more than two UE in the group the operations may end. However if it is determined that there are more than two UE in the group the operations can include removing one or more periphery UE from the UE group at and the operations may end. In various embodiments periphery UE can be determined using the location information for each UE and determining UE that are farthest away from the location of the master UE for the UE group.

In some embodiments after removing one or more periphery UE from the UE group the operations can include at re grouping any of the periphery UE that may be in proximity to each other into one or more other UE groups using one or more of the grouping techniques described herein in the present disclosure. In some embodiments after removing one or more periphery UE from the UE group the operations can include at selecting a new master UE for the UE group using one or more of the master UE selection techniques described herein.

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating example operations associated with facilitating service hand outs for UE using UE groups in accordance with one potential embodiment of communication system . In one or more embodiments operations can be performed by a given small cell radio e.g. any small cell radio or a given macro cell radio e.g. any macro cell radio that may be serving one or more UE in order to facilitate service hand outs for UE served by the cell radio. At any time a given serving cell radio e.g. small cell radio can group and or re group UE e.g. UE connected to the serving cell radio into one or more UE group s can select a master UE for each group and can facilitate service hand outs for UE of each group.

Accordingly operations can begin at and can include grouping UE served by a serving cell radio into one or more UE groups based at least in part on an approximate location of each UE and a proximity of each UE in relation to each other. The serving cell radio can provide a first service to each UE connected to the serving cell radio. At the operations can include selecting a master UE for each UE group using one or more of the techniques described herein in the present disclosure. At the operations can include enabling measurement reporting for each master UE for a target inter frequency and or inter RAT measurement for service hand outs.

At the operations can include receiving by the serving cell radio service measurement information from the master UE selected for each UE group. In various embodiments the service information can be associated with one or more neighboring cell radios which may support services not supported by the serving cell radio. In various embodiments the service measurement information can include the target inter frequency and or inter RAT measurements for an intended measurement quantity e.g. RSRP RSRQ RSCP CPICH Ec Io etc. for the one or more neighboring cell radios.

At any time any UE in any UE group may request a service not supported by the serving cell radio. Accordingly at the operations can include receiving a service request from a particular UE in a particular UE group for a service not supported by the serving cell radio. At the operations can include selecting a neighboring cell radio for service hand out of the particular UE based at least in part on service measurement information received from a particular master UE associated with the particular UE group and the operations may end. In various embodiments service hand out for the particular UE can then continue according to 3GPP standards for the selected neighboring cell radio.

In various embodiments the operations for selecting a neighboring cell radio for service handout can include evaluating the service measurement information associated with the service e.g. intended measurement quantity for target frequency and or RAT type that associated with the service to determine the best neighboring cell radio e.g. neighboring cell radio having the highest strongest measurement quantity to receive the service hand out for the particular UE. Recall the service measurement information can include a corresponding measurement quantity and cell ID for each neighboring cell radio supporting the target frequency and or RAT type. Accordingly the method provided by communication system can facilitate service hand outs for UE using UE groups.

Turning to are simplified block diagrams illustrating additional details associated with one potential embodiment of communication system . In some cases communication system may include a Self Organizing Network SON server as shown in . also includes UE RAN service network mobile core network IP network and small cell radios . UE may be served by small cell radio e.g. having a connection established therewith within its coverage area and can grouped together in a UE Group using any of the techniques described herein. UE may be served by small cell radio within its coverage area and can be grouped together in a UE group using any of the techniques described herein. Macro cell radios are not shown in in order to illustrate other features of communication system . Referring briefly to illustrates that each small cell radio within RAN can be logically interconnected to each other via an X2 interface as provided in 3GPP standards or a proprietary interface e.g. vendor specific operator specific etc. .

Turning back to SON server can interface with any of small cell radio small cell gateway small cell management system and any other element in communication system e.g. macro cell radio s RNC s etc. via service network and mobile core network to facilitate various functions and or operations as described herein. In some embodiments SON server can be configured to monitor and optimize resources for UE served by small cell radios to increase the overall efficiency of communication system . In general SON server may have has a system wide view of communication system which may enable SON server to intelligently provision resources among small cell radios to increase the overall efficiency of communication system . In various embodiments SON server can be implemented in a centralized SON cSON architecture within or across service network and or mobile core network or can be implemented in a distributed SON dSON architecture across cell radios e.g. small cell and or macro cell radio s in communication system .

Before detailing various operational aspects of it is important to understand common characteristics of small cell radio deployments as generally provided in commercial architectures. The following foundation is offered earnestly for teaching purposes only and therefore should not be construed in any way to limit the broad teachings of the present disclosure. In the radio resource environment in which radio resources are highly scarce it is not uncommon to see co channel e.g. intra frequency deployment of small cell radios. Given their ad hoc nature of small cell radio deployment there could be small cell radios having coverage areas which could overlap with each other. In a dense deployment of small cell radios there will likely be more than two small cell radios having overlapping coverage areas. In such cases it can become a challenge to manage interference between small cell radios.

One way to manage interference can be to avoid transmission on radio resource blocks e.g. PRBs used by adjacent cells. This is often made possible via X2 exchanges e.g. via X2 interfaces as shown in between small cell radios in order to schedule coordinated transmissions between adjacent small cell radios. However reducing transmission on all cell edge UEs between adjacent cells may not be needed in some cases as the interference sensed by a one neighbor may not same as that of the other. Another way to manage interference may be through a cloud based RAN C RAN architecture in which scheduling decisions are passed to cell radios via a backhaul network connecting the cell radios to the C RAN control elements. However C RAN architectures typically have high backhaul loads which can lead to increased latency in for scheduling resources at cell radios.

In at least one embodiment communication system can be configured to provide a method to optimize use of radio resources in cases in which small cell radios e.g. small cell radio and may have overlapping coverage areas. In general the method provided by communication system may provide for using UE groups or clusters to provide information on UE density in and or around a given cell radio so intelligent radio resource management can be performed between adjacent cell radios. In various embodiments the method provided by communication system can improve overall efficiency of the network through interference management radio resource management and or handover management for adjacent cell radios. Although the method described herein is described with respect to LTE small cell radios it should be understood that the method is not restricted to LTE deployments and could be extended to UMTS deployments Wi Fi deployments or the like within the scope of the present disclosure.

During operation in at least one embodiment small cell radio may group together UE in a logical grouping for example UE Group . Small cell radio may assign a unique ID to identify UE Group within the context of small cell radio and may create a logical grouping of UE IDs e.g. IMSIs TMSIs etc. identifying UE as members of UE Group . In various embodiments the grouping can be based on intra frequency measurement reporting triangulation etc. as described herein in order to determine the proximity of UE in relation to each other. In a similar manner small cell radio may group together UE in a logical grouping for example UE Group and small cell radio may assign a unique ID to identify UE Group within the context of small cell radio and may create a logical grouping of UE IDs identifying UE as members of UE Group .

In various embodiments the size of a UE group can be adjusted based on the intended use of the group. For example if a UE group is to be used for interference mitigation with the a neighboring cell radio then groups of UE near the source cell radio could be of a large size and groups of UE far away from the source cell radio could be of a smaller size. In certain embodiments using larger UE groups for cell interior UE e.g. near the source cell radio may help to reduce unnecessary communication between the source cell radio and SON server regarding the allocation of resources for cell interior UE which may not need as much or any interference management as compared to cell edge UE.

In some embodiments UE group size can also be defined based on how fine a control is needed for a UE group. For example if broad blanket changes are desired for a UE group then forming a large UE group may be beneficial to apply the changes to the group in an efficient manner. A group of cell interior UE may be one example in which forming large UE group may be beneficial. However if more fine control changes are desired for a group such as for example for interference mitigation techniques then forming smaller UE groups may be beneficial. For example various cell edge UE may be grouped together into small groups depending on the interferers seen e.g. measured by UE in the group in order to provide fine tuned interference management for the different groups. Forming a large group of potentially disparate cell edge UE which might be near different interferers could lead to suboptimal interference mitigation management and or reduced uplink throughput for UE of the large group as coordinating resources may become increasingly difficult and or inefficient as the number of UE and or potential interferers increases. Using smaller groups for cell edge UE in contrast may allow SON server to more accurately pinpoint the location of interferer s for a given small UE group and thereby only issue instructions pertaining to that given UE group for managing the interference for the interferer s . In some embodiments as discussed above UE group size can be adjusted based on group performance for successful service handouts.

In contrast to master UE selection for service handout operations master UE selection for radio resource management interference management and or handover management can be streamlined by removing data rate considerations for master UE selection. In various embodiments a master UE can be selected for a UE Group based on either being at an approximate geographical center of a UE group e.g. for groups having more than two UE or based on proximity and or signal strength in relation to a serving cell radio e.g. for groups having only two UE . In at least one embodiment UE can be selected by small cell radio as the master UE UE for UE Group based on being at the approximate geographical center of UE Group . In at least one embodiment UE can be selected by small cell radio as the master UE UE for UE Group based on being at the approximate geographical center of UE Group .

During operation a master UE for a given UE group e.g. master UE for UE Group and or master UE for UE Group may periodically provide updated position information e.g. feedback information to its serving cell radio given as one or more sets of PCI signal strength pairs for neighboring cell radios measured sensed by the master UE. The source cell radio e.g. small cell radio may communicate the position information the number of UEs in a given group e.g. three for UE Group and three for UE Group the ID for the UE group and in certain embodiments additional information related to the UE group to SON server . In various embodiments the position information size information and or additional information can be used by SON server to determine at a high level resource utilization for a given UE group.

In some embodiments the additional information can vary depending on the management implementation e.g. interference mitigation radio resource handover at SON server . For example if SON server is managing interference mitigation between adjacent cell radios then it may be interested to know the power headroom available at the master UE e.g. difference between the maximum transmit power and the current used transmit power for the master UE for each UE group and or the average data rate served to UE group s . In some embodiments average data rate e.g. average throughput rate can also be used to provide for interference mitigation management for UE groups. In still some embodiments an average uplink e.g. transmission from UE towards serving small cell radio Signal to Interference Plus Noise Ratio SINR for UE of a UE group can be included in the additional information. In still some embodiments downlink Block Error Rate BLER can be included in the additional information. Per 3GPP standards downlink BLER is typically determined by dividing the number of downlink PRBs for a given UE that have resulted in an error e.g. a Cyclic Redundancy Check error by the total number of downlink PRBs that have been communicated to the UE.

Consider a case in which SON server determines that two UE groups in adjacent cells are close to each other e.g. UE Group served by cell radio and UE Group served by cell radio based on messages received from the respective cell radios serving UE Group and UE Group respectively. In one embodiment based on such a determination SON server could instruct both the small cell radios to schedule UE in groups lying close to each other e.g. UE in Group and UE in Group at orthogonal resources e.g. at different PRBs to avoid overlap in both the uplink and downlink. In some embodiments SON server may provide such instruction by communicating to each small cell radio a command including the respective group ID e.g. ID for UE Group and ID for UE Group for each UE group lying close to each other. Upon receiving such instruction in some embodiments small cell radio and small cell radio may communicate with each other via the X2 or proprietary interface in order to schedule orthogonal resources for UE in each UE group.

For example in some embodiments small cell radios may be configured to utilize Vendor Specific Attributes VSAs vendor specific Attribute Value Pairs AVPs vendor specific Information Elements IEs combinations thereof or the like in order to coordinate resources via the X2 or proprietary interface using one or more UE group resource coordination messages that can exchanged between the small cell radios. In various embodiments the UE group resource coordination messages can be configured e.g. via VSAs AVPs IEs etc. to carry group ID information resource block information or other resource coordination information to facilitate UE group resource coordination in order to mitigate interference between UE groups.

In some embodiments SON server could also divide available PRBs into groups or sets of PRBs and could instruct each small cell radio regarding which set of PRBs it may or may not allocate schedule for UE groups served thereby. For example SON server could 1 divide available PRBs into groups X and Y 2 could instruct small cell radio to not schedule UE on PRBs belonging to group X and 3 could instruct small cell radio to not schedule UE on PRBs belonging to group Y. Accordingly in some embodiments SON server could provide instructions for interference mitigation management operations that may not result in X2 or proprietary interface exchanges between cell radios but rather would provide small cell radios directly with the PRBs on which certain UE group s can be scheduled. In such embodiments communication system may provide for a wholly centralized method of interference mitigation management between cell radios. In various embodiments SON server may update the division of PRBs between UE groups upon reassessing interference between the groups.

Consider another case in which SON server determines that a UE group served by one cell radio may be small but may still be generating interference to a neighboring UE group served by another cell radio merely by virtue of the proximity of the small UE group in relation to the neighboring UE group. In one embodiment SON server may determine to handover UE within the small UE group to the neighboring cell radio in order to manage interference between the neighboring cell radios. In some embodiments additional information communicated to SON server can include capacity information for each small cell radio and SON server can consider any trade off between loss of capacity e.g. UE cell throughput due to interference in determining whether to initiate handover for UE in such situations.

In some embodiments capacity information can be determined from PRB usage by small cell radios . For example SON server can determine PRB usage for a particular small cell radio in relation to total available PRBs for the system in order to determine capacity capacity limitations for the particular small cell. In some embodiments such information can be used by a network and or system operator to determine if additional or fewer small cell radios should be deployed in a geographical area.

In some embodiments position information received from a master UE of a given UE group can be used by SON server to trigger Automatic Neighbor Relation ANR functionality for a given small cell radio serving the UE group. By triggering ANR functionality the small cell radio could determine neighboring cell radios which could be added to a neighbor list for the small cell radio used to configure update neighbor relation information for the system etc. Typically ANR operations are performed periodically by small cell radios tasking a particular UE to provide neighbor measurement information. However simple periodic ANR functionality can be inefficient as ANR operations may be needed less often in relatively static deployment environments. Further ANR operations can sacrifice capacity throughput for UE tasked with performing neighbor measurements. However in various embodiments SON server can use position information and or capacity information for UE groups to select a particular master UE for a particular UE group served by a particular small cell radio that may be near a geographic area of interest and or available e.g. having reduced loading to provide ANR information to SON server via the serving cell radio . SON server can use the information to configure update neighbor relation information for communication system for the particular small cell radio for neighboring small cell radios combinations thereof or the like.

In various embodiments the method provided by communication system for various management implementations can include but not be limited to using UE grouping to minimize the overall backhaul load unlike those that are typically found for C RAN architectures and or minimizing the impact to existing small cell radio infrastructure. For example existing X2 interfaces or proprietary interfaces can be exploited to coordinate resources between small cell radios while the radios can be configured with Application Programming Interfaces APIs in order to interface with the SON server. Further by targeting UE groups for coordinated interference mitigation more precise control over resources can be achieved over traditional coordinated X2 interference mitigation coordination. Additionally the method provided by communication system using SON server may in some embodiments provide the ability to determine a UE group causing interference to a neighboring group in order to deal appropriately e.g. initiating handover etc. with the interfering UE group rather than merely lowering the data rate of the neighboring group which is complaining of the high interference. Accordingly in various embodiments the method provided by communication system using SON server may provide for the efficient management of co channel small cell radio deployments to improve UE cell throughput assist in interference management and or improve key performance indicators KPIs such as handover success rate.

Turning to is a simplified flow diagram illustrating other operations associated with master UE selection in accordance with one potential embodiment of communication system .

If there are not more than two UE in the UE group the operations can continue to in which the master UE can be selected for the UE group based on proximity of the each UE in the UE group in relation to the source cell radio. In some embodiments a master UE can be selected for a UE group based on being closest to the source small cell radio. If there are more than two UE in the UE group the operations can continue to in which the master UE can be selected for the UE group that is located at an approximate geographical center of the UE group as determined using the approximate location of each UE determined via intra frequency measurement reporting. At the operations can include assigning an ID to the UE group and at the operations can include relating each UE in the UE group to the ID for the UE group and the operations may end.

At the operations can include determining by SON server management instructions associated with one or more operations to be performed by each small cell radio based on the management configuration of SON server e.g. radio resource management interference mitigation management etc. and UE group in formation received from the small cell radios.

At the operations can include performing at the one or more small cell radios the operations associated with the instructions communicated from SON server and operations may end.

In various embodiments instructions communicated to one or more small cell radios can be associated with performing coordinated resource scheduling operations for UE groups between adjacent small cell radios e.g. via X2 or proprietary interface exchanges adjusting the number of resources to be allocated to UE groups initiating handover operations for UE groups between adjacent small cell radios combinations thereof or the like.
