This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 a to a Korean Patent Application filed the Korean Intellectual Property Office on May 8 2014 and assigned Serial number 10 2014 0054515 the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to control of a power amplifier and more particularly to a device and method for controlling a power amplifier bias applied to a power amplifier according to a communication environment.

An electronic device may implement a wireless communication function by receiving or transmitting signals using an antenna included in the electronic device. The antenna is able to efficiently restore an original signal from a signal detected from a free space using a filtering function and amplification e.g. low noise amplification function even if the strength of the detected signal is low. However when the antenna transmits a signal through free space to an entity a great distance from the electronic device e.g. another terminal a base station or a network the electronic device must sufficiently amplify transmission power e.g. power amplification in order to deliver the signal. In order to enable transmission over greater distances the electronic device uses a Power Amplifier PA to amplify power at a transmitting end. The PA may be operated using specified Direct Current DC power i.e. a bias voltage as a power source.

In a power amplifier control method according to the related art the same PA bias value is applied to a frequency band e.g. 1920 MHz to 1980 MHz for an uplink 2110 MHz to 2170 MHz for a downlink 2 60 MHz band in total corresponding to one RF band e.g. band 1 of WCDMA in order to reduce power consumption of a power amplifier.

However according to this power amplifier control method since a low bias value may be applied even to some channels having a poor PA linearity such as an Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio ACLR among a plurality of channels existing within one band reception sensitivity degradation may occur due to transmission. Furthermore since the same bias value is used for both data communication and a voice call a bias value for optimizing current consumption for the voice call may also be used for the data communication. As a result according to the power amplifier method according to the related art performance degradation may occur in a data mode for which a greater ACLR performance is required.

In contrast to a typical LTE terminal a terminal that supports Carrier Aggregation CA of LTE Advanced LTE A technology may be additionally provided with a wideband coupler or an antenna switch and a diplexer for separating high and low bands between an antenna and a duplexer. Due to such additional elements a transmission path loss may be increased by 1 dB to 3 dB in an electronic device that supports the CA. To compensate for this loss the terminal must increase an output of a voltage amplifier by 1 dB so that current consumption of the voltage amplifier increases. For example if a maximum transmission power is increased by 1 dB to 3 dB the terminal consumes as much as several tens or several hundreds of milliampere of additional current thereby degrading the PA linearity.

The present invention has been made to address at least the above problems and or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly an aspect of the present invention provides a method for improving power consumption and reception sensitivity by adaptively and differently controlling a PA bias value for each channel according to channel characteristics.

In a wireless communication environment such as Third Generation 3G or LTE a plurality of channels may exist in one band.

Herein the terms first bias offset and second bias offset are used for convenience and do not indicate that the bias offset determining module is required to determine two bias offsets. The bias offset determining module determines at least one bias offset according to a communication environment and a configuration of hardware e.g. a Radio Frequency RF Front End RFFE of an electronic device.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias offset applying module may apply a bias offset e.g. the first bias offset or the second bias offset determined by the bias offset determining module to a specified bias value e.g. the bias value stored in the bias look up table .

The channel quality measurement the bias offset determination and the bias offset application may be performed repeatedly. For example the bias offset may be newly applied based on the channel quality measured after the primary bias is applied. The electronic device may control the power amplifier with the bias value to which the bias offset is newly applied e.g. a secondary bias .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias offset applying module obtains a bias value corresponding to a specified channel and transmission power from the bias look up table based on the communication channel and the transmission power.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias value may be trained and optimized according to use of the electronic device.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias storing module stores a bias value in the bias look up table . According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias look up table may be located in an additional storage space e.g. the memory outside the bias module or may be included in the bias module or the bias storing module . According to an embodiment of the present invention the processor may perform operations or functions of the bias module by using commands stored in the memory .

This calibration operation is described in detail with reference to .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias storage module may store in the bias look up table bias values determined based on a measured channel quality or optimized through repeated calibration. Furthermore the bias storage module may update or delete the bias values stored in the bias look up table or may add bias values thereto.

Referring to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a receiver a modem processing module a channel quality measuring module a Transmitting side Digital to Analog Converter Tx DAC a transmitter a bias offset determining module e.g. the bias offset determining module a bias offset applying module e.g. the bias offset applying module a bias LUT e.g. the bias look up table a variable DC DC power supply and a power amplifier . Further descriptions of elements and or operations that are similar to those already described herein above may be omitted for clarity and conciseness.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the receiver may receive a signal of a specified frequency band through an antenna. Furthermore the receiver may receive power control information or scheduling information provided from a base station or a network through a control channel.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the modem processing module may process the received signal or information through a filter e.g. a Band Pass Filter BPF an image frequency rejection filter or the like or an amplifier e.g. a Low Noise Amplifier LNA or the like . The modem processing module may provide to the channel quality measuring module information for determining sensitivity of the received signal. Furthermore the modem processing module may provide the power control information or the like to the Tx DAC .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the channel quality measuring module may measure the channel quality of a received signal. The channel quality may be determined based on for example at least one of a BLock Error Rate BLER a Bit Error Rate BER a Frame Error Rate FER a transmission Tx power level Reference Signal Received Power RSRP Received Signal Code Power RSCP Chip Energy Others Interference Ec Io a Resource Block RB number or an RB position.

The channel quality measuring module may divide a frequency band at a regular interval according to a characteristic of each channel and may measure the channel quality if handover occurs. For example the channel quality measuring module may divide the band 1 of WCDMA by a bandwidth of 20 MHz into six channels and may measure any one of the six channels if handover to the one of the six channels occurs.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the transmitting side digital to analog converter i.e. the Tx DAC may determine transmission power based on the power control information or the scheduling information. The Tx DAC may provide information on the determined transmission power to at least one of the channel quality measuring module the bias LUT or the transmitter . According to an embodiment of the present invention the channel quality measuring module may determine a transmission power level determined based on the information provided from the Tx DAC as the channel quality. Furthermore the bias LUT may provide to the bias offset applying module a bias value corresponding to the information provided from the Tx DAC . Furthermore the transmitter may determine transmission power for a transmission signal based on the information provided from the Tx DAC .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias offset determining module may determine a bias offset based on the channel quality measured by the channel quality measuring module . For example if an index e.g. a BLER or the like that indicates the channel quality is equal to or larger than a threshold i.e. if the channel quality is poor the bias offset determining module may determine the bias offset so that a certain PA bias offset value is added to a current PA bias value e.g. a bias value stored in the bias LUT which corresponds to the information provided from the Tx DAC . According to an embodiment of the present invention the threshold may be differently set for each channel. According to an embodiment of the present invention if the index that indicates the channel quality is equal to or less than the threshold i.e. if the channel quality is satisfactory the bias offset determining module may determine the bias offset so that a certain bias value is subtracted from a current PA bias value. According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias offset may be determined in consideration of a difference in a PA gain characteristic between transmission Tx power level indices or an inner loop power control characteristic of WCDMA. For example the bias offset may be determined as about 0.1 v 0.2 v 0.4 v or 0. If the bias offset is 0 the bias offset is applied to a current bias value so that a modified bias value is equal to an initial or current bias value.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the bias offset applying module may apply the bias offset determined by the bias offset determining module to a bias value stored in the bias LUT . The bias value to which the bias offset value is applied e.g. the primary bias may be provided to the variable DC DC power supply and the variable DC DC power supply may apply a voltage PA Vcc to the power amplifier based on the bias.

Referring to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device or the electronic device measures a quality of a reception channel in operation . According to an embodiment of the present invention the electronic device may measure the channel quality if a specified event e.g. handover occurrence elapse of a predetermined time after latest measurement or transmission power change occurs. The channel quality may be measured using an index such as the transmission Tx power level RSRP RSCP or Ec Io.

In operation the electronic device determines a bias offset based on the measured channel quality. If the channel quality is relatively satisfactory the electronic device may set a negative bias offset so that a PA bias value is reduced by a small amount or may maintain the PA bias value e.g. the bias offset 0 . If the channel quality is relatively poor the electronic device may set a positive bias offset so that the PA bias value is increased.

In operation the electronic device applies the bias offset determined in operation to a specified bias value. For example the electronic device may apply the bias offset determined in operation to a bias value stored in the bias look up table based on an ACLR measurement value or a prestored bias value to which a bias offset has been applied at least once. The power amplifier may amplify transmission power using the bias value to which the bias offset is applied as an input voltage Vcc. A specific application example is described herein below with reference to .

Referring to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device or the electronic device performs operates a specified function or operates in a stand by mode in operation . For example the electronic device may transmit or receive data or may make a call to another user terminal. The electronic device may be in a sleep state while maintaining a connection to a base station.

In operation the electronic device e.g. the modem processing module determines whether handover or hand off occurs. For example the electronic device may determine whether handover occurs with respect to a WCDMA download channel 10714CH. The process proceeds to operation if the handover occurs. Otherwise the process returns to operation . However according to an embodiment of the present invention the electronic device performs operation in response to occurrence of an event other than the handover.

In operation the electronic device e.g. the channel quality measuring module measures the BLER of a reception channel. According to an embodiment of the present invention the electronic device may measure the BLER if a Received Signal Strength Indication RSSI satisfies a specified condition. For example the electronic device may measure the BLER if it is moved to a weak electric field area e.g. an area in which the RSSI is about 108 dBm in electric field conditions in which the RSSI is changed.

In operation the electronic device e.g. the bias offset determining module may compare the measured BLER with a specified ratio e.g. a reference BLER . If the measured BLER value is greater than the reference BLER value the electronic device may determine that the bias offset should have a positive value in operation . For example if the reference BLER is about 0.1 the electronic device may set the bias offset to about 0.2 V so that a current PA bias value is increased by about 0.2 V if the measured BLER is equal to or larger than about 0.1 . If the measured BLER value is less than the reference BLER value the electronic device determines that the bias offset should have a negative value or sets the bias offset as 0 so that the current PA bias value is maintained in operation . For example if the measured BLER is less than about 0.1 the electronic device may set the bias offset to about 0.1 V so that the current PA bias value is reduced by about 0.1 V.

In operation the electronic device e.g. the bias offset applying module applies the bias offset determined in operation or to a specified PA bias. According to an embodiment of the present invention the specified PA bias may be stored in the bias look up table in advance.

In operation the electronic device transmits a signal by amplifying transmission power according to a bias voltage to which the bias offset has been applied in operation .

According to an embodiment of the present invention operations to may be performed repeatedly. For example the electronic device may perform operations to again if a certain time elapses or handover occurs while the electronic device transmits signals in operation using the bias to which the bias offset has been applied in operation e.g. the primary bias . In the above described example the electronic device may check the BLER of a reception channel in the same area where the RSSI is about 108 dBm. In this case if the measured BLER is equal to or larger than about 0.1 the electronic device may further increase the PA bias by about 0.2 V bias offset about 0.2 V . Alternatively if the measured BLER is less than about 0.1 the electronic device may further decrease the PA bias by about 0.1 V bias offset about 0.1 V . The above described process may be repeated a predetermined number of times. In the above described example the electronic device may determine a bias value determined by repeating operations to twice e.g. a secondary bias as a final bias value for a channel 10713CH and may allow the power amplifier to be operated based on the final bias value.

Table 1 shows a change of a bias value for a channel 10713CH according to the process of . A default PA bias may be a value predetermined at the time of initial calibration or product design. Regarding when a transmission power level Tx level is about 24 dBm if the BLER primarily measured is greater than about 0.1 about 3.2 V obtained by increasing the default PA bias about 3.0 V by about 0.2 V bias offset about 0.2 V may be a primary bias. If the measured BLER is less than about 0.1 about 2.9 V obtained by decreasing the default PA bias by about 0.1 V bias offset about 0.1 V may be the primary bias. If the BLER additionally secondarily measured is greater than about 0.1 the electronic device may add about 0.2 V to the primary bias 3.2 V so as to determine about 3.4 V as a secondary bias. If the BLER additionally measured is less than about 0.1 the electronic device may reduce the primary bias 3.2 V by about 0.1 V so as to determine about 3.1 V as the secondary bias the same result may be obtained if the BLER primarily measured is less than about 1 and the BLER secondarily measured is larger than about 1 . If both the BLERs primarily and secondarily measured are less than about 0.1 i.e. if the channel quality is excellent the electronic device may determine the secondary bias as about 2.8 V. In this manner the electronic device may determine the PA bias value for various values of transmission power for the channel 10713CH. The above described method may be applied to various bands and various channels.

Referring to Table 1 a maximum value of the PA bias may be designed so that the same voltage amplifier hardware performance e.g. the ACLR or transmission power is assured even when a voltage amplifier input voltage PA Vcc about 3.4 V is determined in consideration of a voltage drop about 0.1 V due to a wiring under a low voltage battery condition about 3.5 V . Furthermore the maximum value of the PA bias may be set to be about 3.7 V in a PA bias mode or in a bypass mode in which the battery power supply is applied to the input voltage PA Vcc. A minimum value of the PA bias may be set to be about 1.0 V in consideration of a margin of about 0.1 0.2 V for a minimum value about 0.5 0.7 V for satisfying basic hardware performance of the voltage amplifier. However according to an embodiment of the present invention various voltage values may be set as the maximum value or the minimum value.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the channel quality may be measured using a transmission power level. For example due to a hardware design of an RFFE a phenomenon of leakage of a transmission signal is relatively significant with respect to a channel 10838CH and thus the signal reception sensitivity of an adjacent channel e.g. a download channel based on Frequency Division Duplex FDD may be degraded. For example when the transmission power is increased to at least about 15 dBm for a channel e.g. the channel 10838CH in which a reception sensitivity reduction phenomenon occurs due to ACLR characteristic degradation the electronic device may use a transmission power level of the channel to determine the channel quality.

Regarding the above described example in which the transmission power level is as the channel quality the BLER used in the process of may be replaced with the transmission power level. For example handover to an arbitrary channel e.g. the channel 10838CH may occur in operation and the electronic device may check the transmission power level for a location in which the electronic device is currently positioned in operation . Information on transmission power may be included in power control information received through an antenna of the electronic device. For example regarding the example illustrated in the Tx DAC may provide the information on the transmission power included in the power control information to the channel quality measuring module .

In operation it may be determined whether the transmission power level is equal to or larger than a reference value specified transmission power e.g. about 15 dBm . A positive bias offset may be determined in operation if the transmission power level is equal to or larger than the reference value otherwise a bias offset of 0 may be determined. For example if the transmission power is equal to or larger than about 15 dBm a bias offset of about 0.4 V may be applied to a current PA bias or if the transmission power is less than about 15 dBm the current PA bias may be directly used bias offset 0 . Table 2 shows a result according to the transmission power level for the channel 10838CH.

Referring to Table 2 since the PA bias value for initial transmission power is set to be up to about 25 dBm and maximum transmission power for WCDMA is about 24 dBm the transmission power may be set to be about 25 dBm or less in consideration of a margin. According to an embodiment of the present invention the range of the transmission power may be variously set based on maximum transmission power provided by a communication environment and an initial set value of a PA bias.

Table 3 shows a PA bias table that may be obtained by applying a bias offset according to the method of . Such a PA bias table may be stored in the bias look up table in the form of a data structure.

In a typical WCDMA High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA or High Speed Uplink Packet Access HSUPA environment reception sensitivity degradation desensitization may become significant at a transmission power of about 15 dBm or more with respect to a channel having a relatively high frequency among the communication channels shown in Table 3 and a channel of an intermediate frequency band may be designed to have an ACLR margin that is greater than that of a channel having a relatively low frequency by as much as about 2 3 dB. Therefore a plurality of channels may be classified based on a frequency so that a bias or a bias offset to be applied to each of classified channels may be differently determined. For example if the channels are classified into low middle and high channels based on channels 10600CH and 10800CH the bias table shown in Table 3 may be obtained. Referring to Table 3 the same bias value may be applied according to transmission power for the channels 10664CH 10700CH and 10735CH classified as the middle channel. Since the ACLR and reception sensitivity characteristics are relatively excellent in the middle channel a lowest PA bias value is applied as a result of applying a bias offset in comparison with the low or high channel so that current consumption of the electronic device may be reduced. By contrast in the high channel e.g. the channel 10838CH a desensitization phenomenon becomes more significant at a transmission power of about 15 dBm or more and the ACLR margin is not sufficient. Therefore a greater PA bias value may be applied to the high channel in comparison with the low or middle channel. However according to an embodiment of the present invention if a channel state e.g. the channel quality is satisfactory the high channel may be operated with the same PA bias value as that of the low channel e.g. the channel 10562CH as shown in the right side data of Table 3.

In detail is a diagram illustrating a change of current consumption according to a PA bias value with respect to the WCDMA downlink channel 10700CH. As the PA bias value is decreased the ACLR performance degrades but current consumption of a power amplifier may be linearly reduced. For example the electronic device may determine the PA bias value within a range satisfying about 40 dBc in consideration of an ACLR margin of about 7 dB. In the present example the PA bias value is reduced to about 3.1 V and the current consumption is about 445 mA at the PA bias value of 3.1 V. The reduction of the PA bias value may cause current consumption reduction of up to about 90 mA in comparison with the case where the PA bias is about 3.7 V current consumption is about 535 mA or the case where the PA bias is about 3.4 V current consumption is about 495 mA .

Referring to as the PA bias value is increased linearity of a power amplifier increases and a leakage component of a transmission signal of a reception frequency band decreases so that the desensitization phenomenon is reduced. The electronic device may determine the PA bias value within a range satisfying about 40 dBc in consideration of an ACLR margin of about 7 dB as described above with reference to . If the electronic device increases the PA bias value the reception sensitivity may be improved since an RSSI value measured when the BER or BLER is about 0.1 is reduced from about 107 to about 108.5 . As shown in the reception sensitivity is improved by as much as about 1.5 dBm if the PA bias value is increased from about 3.4 V to about 3.6 V for the WCDMA downlink channel 10838CH.

A bias control method of an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present invention may include measuring a channel quality of a received signal determining a bias offset based on the measured channel quality applying the determined bias offset to a specified bias value and amplifying transmission power according to the bias value to which the bias offset is applied.

The configurations or effects described above with reference to Embodiments of the present invention corresponding to may be applied to the following description with reference to .

Referring to an electronic device e.g. the electronic device or the electronic device divides a frequency band at a regular interval into a plurality of channels according to a characteristic of each channel and may set one of the plurality of channels in operation . In operation the electronic device sets transmission power e.g. maximum transmission power 24 dBm or the like for the set channel and also sets a maximum PA bias.

In operation the electronic device measures an ACLR as an index that indicates linearity of a power amplifier. For example the electronic device may calculate a difference in power between a center channel and a position e.g. a channel spaced apart therefrom by a specified offset frequency in units of dBc.

In operation the electronic device compares a measured ACLR value with a reference margin value. For example if the measured ACLR value is greater than the reference margin value the PA bias may be calibrated to a lower value since the linearity is sufficiently satisfactory. Once the PA bias is calibrated the process returns to operation so that the ACLR may be measured.

Operations to are repeated until the measured ACLR value becomes less than or equal to the reference margin value. If the measured ACLR value is less than or equal to the reference margin value the process proceeds to operation so that the PA bias value most recently calibrated to a lower value may be maintained and the process may proceed to operation of . The following process will be described with reference to .

The process of is performed following operation of . In operation the electronic device checks a BER or FER.

The following description is provided based on the BER.

In operation the electronic device compares the measured BER with a reference BER or a threshold BER . The reference BER may be differently set for each channel. If the measured BER is greater than a reference value e.g. about 0.1 the electronic device may increase the PA bias value e.g. the bias value maintained in operation in operation . Since the PA bias value is increased the BER may be improved. If the measured BER is lower than the reference value the electronic device maintains the PA bias value e.g. the bias value maintained in operation in operation . In operation the electronic device e.g. the bias storing module stores the PA bias in the bias LUT e.g. the bias look up table or the bias LUT .

According to an embodiment of the present invention the electronic device may adjust the PA bias value using the transmission power level. For example regarding the channel 10838CH the leakage phenomenon of a transmission signal may be serious causing degradation of the reception sensitivity of an adjacent channel. Regarding the example of adjusting the PA bias using the transmission power level the BER used in the process of may be replaced with the transmission power level. For example in operation the electronic device may check the transmission power when the terminal enters the online mode. For example if the transmission power falls within a specified range e.g. about 15 25 dBm in operation the electronic device increases a current PA bias value e.g. the bias value maintained in operation in operation and stores the increased PA bias value in the bias look up table in operation . If the transmission power is outside the specified range the electronic device maintains a previously set PA bias value e.g. the bias value maintained in operation in operation and then stores the maintained bias value in the bias look up table in operation .
