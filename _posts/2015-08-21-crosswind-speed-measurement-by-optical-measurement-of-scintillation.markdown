When in flight the trajectory of a projectile fired from a weapon into the atmosphere at an intended target is affected by ballistic factors including temperature atmospheric pressure humidity air friction drag inclination angle Coriolis drift due to latitude air movement wind and the like. A crosswind is a wind moving across the projectile s trajectory and pushing against the projectile causing the projectile to deviate from its current trajectory for example to a side. At longer target ranges crosswind effects on a projectile must be taken into account. As crosswinds may vary in speed at different points along the projectile s planned trajectory compensating for crosswind effects normally requires estimations measurements to be made at different ranges between the weapon and the intended target and an average crosswind speed to be calculated to properly account for cumulative crosswind effects on the projectile. Crosswind speeds are often estimated by manual visual observations made by a weapon operator and or an assistant target spotter and then an adjustment a target offset is made to a weapon point of aim using a weapon s sights and or physical adjustment of the weapon s direction of aim in order to correct for estimated crosswind effects on a fired projectile. Manual observation accuracy is affected by training experience and or skills of a weapon operator spotter. Inaccurate observations estimations can introduce unacceptable error into offset calculations and result in a projectile missing a target.

The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation. One method includes One method includes projecting radiation into a medium receiving over time with a photodetector receiver a plurality of scintillation patterns of scattered radiation comparing cumulative a radiation intensity for each received scintillation pattern of the received plurality of scintillation patterns and measuring a cumulative weighted average cross movement within the medium using the compared cumulative radiation intensities.

Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding systems configured to perform the actions of the method. One or more systems can be configured to perform particular actions of the method. The systems can include one or more computers configured to perform the particular operations or actions by virtue of having software firmware hardware computer readable media or a combination of software firmware hardware or computer readable media installed on the systems. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that when executed by a computer cause the computer to perform the actions.

The foregoing and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features alone or in combination 

A second aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects further comprising calculating a ballistic solution for a projectile using at least the calculated cumulative weighted average cross movement within the medium and calculating a weapon aiming offset using the calculated ballistic solution.

A third aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects further comprising determining that a particular scintillation pattern is moving determining a direction of movement for the particular scintillation pattern and determining a speed of movement for the particular scintillation pattern.

A fourth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects wherein the determination that the particular scintillation pattern is moving is performed by a cross covariance computation between two or more scintillation patterns.

A fifth aspect combinable with any of the previous aspects further comprising providing a multi axis scintillation pattern movement determination.

The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular implementations so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. First chosen weapon accuracy is enhanced by mitigating crosswind effects on fired projectiles. Second laser scintillation allows for highly accurate real time crosswind speed measurements. Third the crosswind speed measurement can be calculated as a weighted average crosswind speed along the entire path from a weapon to target providing complete target path coverage including ranges beyond accurate manual observation and or estimation capabilities. Fourth accurate crosswind speed measurements can be calculated using a single pixel receiver. Fifth accurate crosswind speed measurements and or point of aim offsets can be made in different weather and atmospheric conditions. Sixth due to provided real time high accuracy offset calculations concealment safety of a weapon operator and or assistant target spotter is enhanced by maximizing weapon to target engagement ranges and minimizing weapon operator assistant target spotter and or weapon movement necessary to adjust a projectile point of aim to impact a desired target. Seventh training of weapon operators and or assistant target spotters is enhanced by providing real time feedback and or correction of manual visual crosswind speed observations estimations and offset calculations for various target ranges. Eighth the crosswind calculation system CCS combines a ballistic calculator receiver s and laser emitter s in a compact portable weapon mountable package. Ninth the CCS can be networked with other CCS units and or suitable weather atmospheric data systems to enhance accuracy of crosswind calculations ballistic solutions and related provided data and or functions. Other advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Tenth one or more components of the CCS can be coupled with other instruments to provide useful combined instrumentalities.

The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

This disclosure generally describes methods and systems for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation.

The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. By measuring movement of scintillation patterns along a path between an origin and destination a cumulative crosswind speed measurement can be calculated. An example application includes providing a ballistic solution for a projectile along with a provided crosswind corrective offset applied to enhance the likelihood that the projectile will impact an intended target. Various modifications to the disclosed implementations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from scope of the disclosure. Thus the present disclosure is not intended to be limited only to the described and or illustrated implementations but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.

Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light or other electromagnetic radiation by particles smaller than the wavelength of light. For example ambient light and or a laser of sufficient power fired through a medium such as the atmosphere gas water liquid etc. causes atoms molecules of gas liquid to move at the same frequency of the laser radiation and become a small radiating dipole scattering the laser radiation. Similarly Mie scattering results when roughly spherical particles approximately the size of the wavelength of the laser radiation for example microscopic liquid droplets particulates dust pollen smoke and the like scatter the laser radiation when exposed to the laser.

Based at least partially on Kolmogorov s theory of 1941 it is known that temperature gradients in a gas or liquid cause the formation of small turbulent cells or eddies of varying density. The eddies act as lenses and prisms to diffract refract electromagnetic radiation passing through them causing modulations in apparent intensity of the radiation or scintillation . Although the temperature gradients intensity modulations are small for a given volume of gas liquid the cumulative effect of applied electromagnetic radiation for example from a laser transmitter passing through many moving eddies over a long distance is measurable by one or more receivers that detect and measure over time an eddy caused scintillation pattern of Rayleigh Mie scattered laser radiation along a path from an illumination laser transmitter to a particular target and or scattered from the particular target. As eddies drift from gas liquid current through a laser path an associated scintillation pattern created by the eddies moves as well. A change in a scintillation pattern is measured and the measurement converted into a cumulative weighted average crosswind crosscurrent speed for the entire path to the particular target for use in measuring a crosswind corrective crosscurrent corrective offset.

The laser transmitter is coupled with appropriate optics for illumination laser focusing and transmission. The illumination laser is used to illuminate a target. In some implementations a target can include a gas liquid for example air water at a desired distance. In some implementations the laser can operate in a continuous or pulsed mode. A continuously operating laser transmitter can provide real time continuous crosswind speed calculations while a pulsed laser transmitter can provide intermittent as needed crosswind speed calculations. In addition if a laser is pulsed and receivers are gated a given segment of distance between the laser source and the atmosphere at the distance can be measured. For example crosswind speed can be measured in a segment of 100 120 m from the laser source. Next a segment 120 140 m can be measured. In this manner the average crosswind to each segment can be determined and the particular segment crosswinds also determined.

In some implementations the laser transmitter emission axis is bore sighted parallel to the detection axis of the receivers . In other implementations the laser transmitter emission axis is placed at an angle to the detection axis of the receivers . In some implementations the CCS does not include a laser transmitter and instead depends upon sufficient ambient or other light sources to provide necessary illumination to detect atmospheric eddies between the CCS and a target. For example for daytime use sunlight can provide sufficient illumination for scintillation pattern detection. In some implementations other sufficient light sources may include high intensity flood lights security lights flashlights headlights scattered illumination targeting and or other laser light and the like.

Typically each receiver is made up of one photodiode coupled with appropriate optics for focusing a separate received scintillation pattern image on the photodiode. The cumulative intensity of the light of the received scintillation pattern is converted by the photodiode into either current or voltage depending on a photodiode mode of operation which can then be analyzed in order to determine the individual scintillation pattern light intensity. In this manner each photodiode can be considered as a single pixel receiver in that it receives a scintillation pattern and converts the received scintillation pattern into a single data point measuring cumulative light intensity of the scintillation pattern. Known spacing between and a size of receivers are factored into detection calculation software allowing each receiver to detect a particular scintillation pattern intensity and for the CCS to compare multiple intensity determinations over time in order to further determine whether the scintillation pattern is moving a direction of movement a speed of movement and a cumulative weighted average crosswind speed for the entire path to the particular target. The minimum number of receivers is one but two or more receivers or one or more receivers with multiple photodiodes may be used to enhance crosswind calculation accuracy as well as provide multi axis scintillation pattern movement determinations. Other receiver implementations can include multiple photodiodes and or single photodiodes. In some instances optics can be used to focus light on particular detector areas of a photodiode. In these instances the use of the optics can allow the simulation of multiple individual grouped photodiodes. For example a quadrant detector or simulated quadrant detector can be used in some implementations.

In another implementation a receiver detection axis can be moved to vary its angle with respect to a fixed emission axis of the laser transmitter . For example assume an X Y coordinate system where the X axis is an illumination laser placed at 100 0 and is firing toward higher values of X and a receiver is placed at 0 100 and faces toward higher Y values. If the receiver is rocked from points 10 0 0 0 and 10 0 scintillation patterns can be detected at each point along the path of the illumination laser . In these implementations the laser transmitter and or receiver can be moved using for example electric motors mechanical methods hydraulics and or other suitable methods.

In other implementations each photodetector can also be subdivided using optics to allow restrict illumination of a portion of the photodetector. For example optics with diaphragms can be used to allow restrict illumination of the portions of the photodetector. In this manner each single photodetector can be used to simulate multiple photodetector for example a quadrant detector. In this implementation for example quadrant receiver in could be a single photodiode. Optics could then be used to create the A B C and D quadrant configuration or any other number of distinguishable illuminated portions of the photodetector including 2 3 or 4 portions.

The illumination laser assembly includes a collimator and a laser transmitter . The laser transmitter can be among other things a light emitting diode LED a super luminescent diode SLD a solid chemical and or gas laser and or multiple lasers or arrays of laser emitters covering different laser powers frequencies and or optical properties. For example an emitted illumination laser can be visible invisible and or multi frequency. The collimator narrows and aligns the output of the laser transmitter to produce a narrow focused illumination laser with which to illuminate a target to produce scattered laser radiation as shown in .

The alignment laser assemblies each also include a collimator and a laser transmitter to emit alignment lasers used to assist with aligning a CCS with the riflescope crosshairs of a weapon the CCS is mounted upon. The collimator associated with the alignment laser assemblies operates similarly to that in the illumination laser assembly . Each alignment laser assembly laser transmitter can also be a light emitting diode LED a super luminescent diode SLD a solid chemical and or gas laser and or multiple lasers or arrays of laser emitters covering different laser powers frequencies and or optical properties. For example an emitted alignment laser can be visible invisible and or multi frequency. In some implementations the pair of alignment laser assemblies can be made up of a visible and an invisible alignment laser. The visible alignment laser assembly can be used for example during daytime and or in a safe environment where visibility of an alignment laser is either necessary and or not of concern to a CCS operator. Likewise the invisible alignment laser assembly can be used during nighttime where concealment of a CCS operator is a priority and or in other environments where visibility of an alignment laser is not necessary and or of concern to a CCS operator. In some implementations both alignment lasers can be used simultaneously. In some implementations both alignment lasers can be either visible or invisible. In other implementations there can be zero one or three or more available alignment laser assemblies.

The integrating circuits each sample an associated photodetector and transfer the data to system memory not illustrated where the data is accessed by internally stored applications not illustrated providing crosswind speed wind calculator application WCA and ballistic solution calculations ballistic solver application BSA executed by a main system processor . The WCA performs crosswind speed calculations based on the sampled photodetector data and weather atmospheric data provided by integrated or connected weather atmospheric sensors. The BSA provides projectile ballistic calculation and other related functionality refer to and associated descriptions below for additional information concerning BSA functionality based upon ballistics data and the weather atmospheric data provided by the integrated or connected weather atmospheric sensors. The BSA computes wind influence on a projectile achieving six degrees of freedom using a three degree of freedom modified point mass numerical solver that considers velocity time of flight and bullet drop as a function of the projectile s position downrange until the projectile reaches the target taking into account current environmental conditions. The BSA fully accounts for Coriolis effects in both vertical and horizontal directions of fire spin drift and aerodynamic jump the Magnus effect . The BSA contains all standard drag curves G1 G7 etc. and the ability to input create custom drag curves for custom designer projectiles.

Generally the processor executes instructions and manipulates data to perform the operations of the CCS . Specifically the processor executes instructions required to provide calculations and associated functionality for measuring crosswind speed by optical measurement of laser scintillation and providing ballistic solution calculations. Although illustrated as a single processor two or more processors may be used according to particular needs desires or particular implementations of the CCS .

The processor is coupled with one or more external device interfaces used for connecting external devices to the CCS . The external device interfaces can support for example universal serial bus USB FIREWIRE LIGHTNING RS 232 BLUETOOTH WiFi wireless cellular and or other suitable interface type connectivity to the CCS . External devices could include a flash memory to store data a computer to update internal software application programs not illustrated a KESTREL brand pocket weather station PWS providing among other things temperature pressure and humidity data a rifle scope a spotting scope a display a recording device such as a computer or server to capture the data from the CCS an array of wind turbines and the like.

The sensor and user interface processor is coupled with the processor and provides functionality to integrate support for various built in sensors e.g. an inclination sensor digital magnetic compass temperature sensor pressure sensor humidity sensor and the like is available a digital display and a user input keypad . The digital display provides for example textual and or graphical data to a CCS user regarding crosswind speed ballistic solutions target data atmospheric data and other suitable data. In some implementations the digital display can be configured to be removable in a communicably coupled manner with the CCS unit for example using a wired or wireless connection. In other implementations a separate communicably coupled digital display can be used in conjunction with a digital display integrated into the CCS unit. In this implementation each digital display can display different data to a CCS user.

The user input keypad allows a CCS user to manually input data and or select menu options and or functions settings directly on the CCS unit. In some implementations the user input keypad can be configured to be removable in a communicably coupled manner with the CCS unit for example using a wired or wireless connection. In other implementations a separate communicably coupled user input keypad can be used in conjunction with a user input keypad integrated into the CCS unit. In this implementation each user input keypad can be used to input different data to a CCS unit.

The accessory rail mount actuator provides functionality to attach the CCS to an accessory mounting rail or base on for example a firearm or a scope. For example the accessory rail mount actuator can allow the CCS to be mounted to a PICATINNY rail WEAVER rail tripod adapter and other suitable accessory rail or base types. In other implementations the accessory rail mount actuator allows the CCS to be mounted to accessory rails on vehicles tripods walls towers and other stationary and or mobile structures.

In other implementations a rifle scope sight can be integrated into a CCS system to provide fully integrated functionality. In other implementations one or more of WSA and or BSA can be integrated into a rifle scope sight without the laser illumination detection and laser alignment features of the described CCS . Other variations of CCS feature integration with a rifle scope sight consistent with this disclosure are also envisioned.

In other implementations a CCS system can be coupled with a laser range finder LRF to provide laser ranging of a target and crosswind speed analysis simultaneously. Coupling can be accomplished by wired wireless and or other suitable connections between the LRF and the CCS system. A LRF can be coupled with any of the CCS implementations described herein. For example for shooting sports a shooter could use the combined instrument to simultaneously determine a range to a target and crosswind. Likewise the described combined instrument could be used in sports such as golf to assist a player with determining a range to a hole and factoring in winds for a golf hit.

In other implementations the CCS system can include and provide integrated LRF functionality. For example the illumination laser or an alignment laser can be used in conjunction with included LRF application software and or hardware not illustrated to provide the integrated LRF functionality. In some implementations two or more of the illumination laser and or alignment lasers can be used to provide for example increased LRF accuracy and range. Integrated LRF functionality can be coupled with any of the CCS implementations described herein.

In another implementation the CCS system can provide data to an automated weapon system. The weapon system can include computers servers platforms electric motors servo mechanisms and associated components to provide multi axis movement and or the like. For example the CCS system provided ballistic and or crosswind speed measurement data can be used by the automated weapon system to automatically aim a weapon at a target and or track a target with a weapon. In some implementations the weapon can also be automatically fired by the automated weapon system responsive to data provided by the CCS system. Another implementation could include the CCS system provided ballistic and or crosswind speed measurement data used to physically adjust the zero of a weapon sighting device to account for the effects of the data on a projectile thus saving a weapon operator from making sighting device adjustments and or holding based on provided offset windage values.
