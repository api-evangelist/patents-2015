Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the descriptions of the embodiments and conventional configurations the same components or components with the same functions are basically denoted by the same reference symbols and the same explanation will not be repeated in subsequent embodiments and conventional configurations. The descriptions below are mere examples and do not limit the scope of the appended claims. Further a person skilled in the art may easily conceive other embodiments by making modifications or changes within the scope of the appended claims however such modifications and changes obviously fall within the scope of the appended claims. In the drawings Y M C and K are symbols appended to components corresponding to yellow magenta cyan and black respectively and will be omitted appropriately.

A first embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The first embodiment includes techniques according to first to third examples to be described later.

Four toner containers Y M C K serving as powder containers corresponding to different colors yellow magenta cyan black are detachably replaceably attached to a toner container holder serving as a container holding section provided in the upper part of the printer . An intermediate transfer device is arranged below the toner container holder .

The intermediate transfer device includes an intermediate transfer belt serving as an intermediate transfer medium four primary transfer bias rollers Y M C K a secondary transfer backup roller multiple tension rollers an intermediate transfer cleaning device and the like. The intermediate transfer belt is stretched and supported by multiple rollers and endlessly moves counterclockwise in along with rotation of the secondary transfer backup roller serving as one of the rollers.

In the printer four image forming sections Y M C K as image forming units corresponding to the respective colors are arranged in tandem so as to face the intermediate transfer belt . Four toner replenishing devices Y M C K serving as powder supply replenishing devices corresponding to the four toner containers Y M C K of the four colors are arranged below the toner containers Y M C K respectively. The toner replenishing devices Y M C K respectively supply replenish toner that is powder developer contained in the toner containers Y M C K to developing devices of the image forming sections Y M C K for the respective colors. In the embodiment the four image forming sections Y M C K form an image forming unit.

As illustrated in the printer includes an exposing device serving as a latent image forming means below the four image forming sections Y M C K. The exposing device exposes and scans the surfaces of photoconductors Y M C K serving as image bearers to be described later with light based on image information of an original image read by the scanner so that electrostatic latent images are formed on the surfaces of the photoconductors. The image information may be input from an external apparatus such as a personal computer connected to the copier instead of being read by the scanner .

In the embodiment a laser beam scanning system using a laser diode is employed as the exposing device . However other configurations such as a configuration including an LED array may be employed as the exposing means.

The image forming section Y includes the drum shaped photoconductor Y. The image forming section Y includes a charging roller Y serving as a charging device a developing device Y serving as a developing means a cleaning device Y serving as a photoconductor cleaning device a neutralizing device and the like all of which are arranged around the photoconductor Y. Image forming processes a charging process an exposing process a developing process a transfer process and a cleaning process are performed on the photoconductor Y so that a yellow toner image is formed on the photoconductor Y.

The other three image forming sections M C K have almost the same configurations as the image forming section Y for yellow except that colors of toner to be used are different and toner images corresponding to the respective toner colors are formed on the photoconductors M C K. Hereinafter explanation of only the image forming section Y for yellow will be given and explanation of the other three image forming sections M C K will be omitted appropriately.

The photoconductor Y is rotated clockwise in by a drive motor. The surface of the photoconductor Y is uniformly charged at a position facing the charging roller Y charging process . Subsequently the surface of the photoconductor Y reaches a position of irradiation with laser light L emitted by the exposing device where an electrostatic latent image for yellow is formed through exposure scanning exposing process . The surface of the photoconductor Y then reaches a position facing the developing device Y where the electrostatic latent image is developed with yellow toner to form a yellow toner image developing device .

The primary transfer bias roller Y of the intermediate transfer device and the photoconductor Y sandwich the intermediate transfer belt so that a primary transfer nip for yellow is formed. A transfer bias with polarity opposite to the polarity of toner is applied to the primary transfer bias roller Y.

The surface of the photoconductor Y on which the toner image is formed through the developing process reaches the primary transfer nip facing the primary transfer bias roller Y across the intermediate transfer belt and the toner image on the photoconductor Y is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt at the primary transfer nip primary transfer process . At this time a slight amount of non transferred toner remains on the photoconductor Y. The surface of the photoconductor Y from which the toner image has been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt at the primary transfer nip reaches a position facing the cleaning device Y. At this position the non transferred toner remaining on the photoconductor Y is mechanically collected by a cleaning blade included in the cleaning device Y cleaning process . The surface of the photoconductor Y finally reaches a position facing the neutralizing device where the residual potential on the photoconductor Y is removed. In this way a series of the image forming processes performed on the photoconductor Y is completed.

The above image forming processes are also performed on the other image forming sections M C K in the same manner as the image forming section Y for yellow. Specifically the exposing device arranged below the image forming sections M C K emits laser light L based on the image information toward the photoconductors M C K of the image forming sections M C K. More specifically the exposing device emits the laser light L from a light source and irradiates each of the photoconductors M C K with the laser light L via multiple optical elements while performing scanning with the laser light L by a rotating polygon mirror.

Subsequently toner images of the respective colors formed on the photoconductors M C K through the developing process are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt due to the action of transfer biases applied to the respective primary transfer bias rollers at the four color primary transfer nips that are formed by sandwiching the intermediate transfer belt between the primary transfer bias rollers M C K and the photoconductors M C K.

At this time the intermediate transfer belt moves counterclockwise in and sequentially passes through the primary transfer nips of the primary transfer bias rollers Y M C K. Therefore the toner images of the respective colors on the photoconductors Y M C K are primary transferred to the intermediate transfer belt in a superimposed manner so that a color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt .

The intermediate transfer belt on which the color toner image is formed by the superimposed toner images of the respective colors reaches a position facing a secondary transfer roller . At this position the secondary transfer backup roller and the secondary transfer roller sandwich the intermediate transfer belt so that a secondary transfer nip is formed. The color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt is transferred to a recording medium P such as a sheet of paper conveyed to the position of the secondary transfer nip due to the action of a transfer bias applied to the secondary transfer backup roller for example. At this time non transferred toner which has not been transferred to the recording medium P remains on the intermediate transfer belt . The intermediate transfer belt that has passed through the secondary transfer nip reaches the position of the intermediate transfer cleaning device where the non transferred toner remaining on the surface is collected. In this way a series of transfer processes performed on the intermediate transfer belt is completed.

The recording medium P is conveyed to the secondary transfer nip from a feed tray provided in the sheet feeder arranged below the printer via a feed roller a registration roller pair and the like. Specifically multiple recording media P are stacked in the feed tray . When the feed roller is rotated counterclockwise in the topmost recording medium P is fed to a nip between two rollers of the registration roller pair .

The recording medium P conveyed to the registration roller pair temporarily stops at the position of the nip between the rollers of the registration roller pair the rotation of which is being stopped. The registration roller pair is rotated to convey the recording medium P toward the secondary transfer nip in accordance with the timing at which the color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt reaches the secondary transfer nip. Accordingly a desired color image is formed on the recording medium P.

The recording medium P on which the color toner image is transferred at the secondary transfer nip is conveyed to the position of a fixing device . In the fixing device the color toner image transferred on the surface of the recording medium P is fixed to the recording medium P by heat and pressure applied by a fixing belt and a pressing roller. The recording medium P that has passed through the fixing device is discharged to the outside of the apparatus via a nip between rollers of a discharge roller pair . The recording medium P discharged to the outside of the apparatus by the discharge roller pair is sequentially stacked as an output image on a stack section . In this way a series of image forming processes in the copier is completed.

A configuration and operation of the developing device in the image forming section will be explained in detail below. In the following the image forming section Y for yellow will be explained by way of example. However the image forming sections M C K for the other colors have the same configurations and perform the same operation.

As illustrated in the developing device Y includes a developing roller Y serving as a developer bearer a doctor blade Y serving as a developer regulating plate two developer conveying screws Y a toner density sensor Y and the like. The developing roller Y faces the photoconductor Y. The doctor blade Y faces the developing roller Y. The two developer conveying screws Y are arranged inside two developer accommodating sections i.e. first and second developer accommodating sections Y and Y. The developing roller Y includes a magnet roller disposed inside thereof a sleeve that rotates around the magnet roller and the like. Two component developer G containing carrier and toner is stored in the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y. The second developer accommodating section Y communicates with a toner dropping passage Y via an opening provided in the upper side thereof. The toner density sensor Y detects a toner density in the developer G stored in the second developer accommodating section Y.

The developer G in the developing device circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being stirred by the two developer conveying screws Y. The developer G in the first developer accommodating section Y is supplied to and borne on the surface of the sleeve of the developing roller Y due to a magnetic field generated by the magnet roller in the developing roller Y while the developer G is being conveyed by one of the developer conveying screws Y. The sleeve of the developing roller Y rotates counterclockwise as indicated by an arrow in and the developer G borne on the developing roller Y moves on the developing roller Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this time the toner in the developer G electrostatically adheres to the carrier by being charged to the potential opposite to the polarity of the carrier due to triboelectric charging with the carrier in the developer G and is borne on the developing roller Y together with the carrier that is attracted by the magnetic field generated on the developing roller Y.

The developer G borne on the developing roller Y is conveyed in the arrow direction in and reaches a doctor section where the doctor blade Y and the developing roller Y face each other. The amount of the developer G on the developing roller Y is regulated and adjusted to an appropriate amount when the developer G passes through the doctor section and then the developer G is conveyed to a development area facing the photoconductor Y. In the development area the toner in the developer G adheres to the latent image formed on the photoconductor Y by a developing electric field generated between the developing roller Y and the photoconductor Y. The developer G remaining on the surface of the developing roller Y that has passed through the development area reaches the upper side of the first developer accommodating section Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this position the developer G is separated from the developing roller Y.

The developer G in the developing device Y is adjusted so that the toner density falls within a predetermined range. Specifically toner contained in the toner container Y is replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y by the toner replenishing device Y to be described later through the toner dropping passage Y in accordance with the consumption of toner of the developer G in the developing device Y through the development. The toner replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being mixed and stirred with the developer G by the two developer conveying screws Y.

Incidentally the diameter of the toner container K containing black toner among the four toner containers Y M C K may be increased relative to the diameters of the toner containers Y M C containing yellow toner magenta toner and cyan toner. With this configuration it is possible to reduce the frequency to replace the toner container K containing black toner that is frequently used. Even in this case the toner replenishing devices have approximately the same configurations except that the colors of toner used in the image forming processes and the diameters of the toner containers vary from one another. Therefore the toner container Y will be mainly described below.

The yellow toner contained in the toner container Y among the toner containers Y M C K for the respective colors attached to the toner container holder of the printer illustrated in is appropriately replenished to the developing device in accordance with the consumption of toner in the developing device as illustrated in . At this time the toner in the toner container Y is replenished by the toner replenishing device Y. The toner replenishing device Y includes the toner container holder a conveying nozzle Y serving as a conveying pipe a conveying screw Y serving as a main body conveyor the toner dropping passage Y a driving part Y serving as a container rotating part and the like. The toner replenishing devices for the other colors have the same configurations. When a user performs attachment operation to push the toner container Y in the attachment direction Q in and the toner container Y is moved inside the toner container holder of the printer along with the attachment direction Q the conveying nozzle Y of the toner replenishing device Y is inserted from a front side of the toner container Y in the attachment operation. Therefore the toner container Y and the conveying nozzle Y communicate with each other. A configuration for the communication along with the attachment operation will be described in detail later.

The toner container Y may be referred to as a toner bottle. The toner container Y mainly includes a container front end cover Y serving as a container cover or a held portion that is non rotatably held by the toner container holder and includes an approximately cylindrical container body Y serving as a powder storage integrated with a container gear Y serving as a container side gear. The container body Y is rotatably held by the container front end cover Y. In a setting cover Y is a part of a container cover receiving section of the toner container holder .

As illustrated in the toner container holder mainly includes the container cover receiving section a container receiving section and an insertion hole part . The container cover receiving section is a section for holding the container front end covers Y M C K and the container bodies Y M C K of the toner containers Y M C K for the respective colors. The container receiving section is a section for supporting the container bodies Y M C K of the toner containers Y M C K. An insertion hole serving as an insertion opening used in the attachment operation of the toner containers Y M C K is defined by the insertion hole part . When a main body cover arranged on the front side of the copier the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of is opened the insertion hole part of the toner container holder is exposed. Then attachment detachment operation of the toner containers Y M C K attachment detachment operation with the longitudinal direction of the toner containers taken as an attachment detachment direction in which the toner containers of the respective colors are attached to and detached from the toner replenishing devices is performed from the front side of the copier while the toner containers Y M C K are oriented with their longitudinal directions being parallel to the horizontal direction.

The container receiving section is provided such that its longitudinal length becomes approximately the same as the longitudinal lengths of the container bodies Y M C K of the respective colors. The container cover receiving section is arranged on a container front side a side in the attachment direction Q of the container receiving section in the longitudinal direction attachment detachment direction and the insertion hole part is arranged on one end side a side in the detachment direction Q of the container receiving section in the longitudinal direction. The four toner containers Y M C K are able to moves on the container receiving section in a sliding manner. Therefore along with the attachment operation of the toner containers the container front end covers Y M C K first pass through the insertion hole part slides on the container receiving section for a while and are finally attached to the container cover receiving section .

While the container front end cover Y is attached to the container cover receiving section the driving part container rotating part Y including a driving motor a driving gear and the like as illustrated in inputs rotation drive to the container gear Y that is a gear arranged in the container body Y via a container driving gear Y serving as an apparatus main body gear. Therefore the container body Y is rotated in the arrow A direction in . With the rotation of the container body Y a spiral rib Y formed in a spiral shape on the inner surface of the container body Y conveys toner in the container body Y from one end on the right side in to the other end on the left side in along the longitudinal direction of the container body. Namely in the embodiment the spiral rib Y serves as a rotary conveyor. Consequently the toner is supplied to the inside of the conveying nozzle Y via a nozzle hole Y serving as a powder receiving hole provided on the conveying nozzle Y and supplied from the other side of the toner container Y where the container front end cover Y is attached. The nozzle hole Y communicates with an opening of shutter supporting portion serving as a shutter side opening to be described later at an inner position relative to the position where the container gear Y is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the container body Y. Specifically the container gear Y meshes with the container driving gear Y on a container opening side in the longitudinal direction of the toner container relative to the position where the nozzle hole and the opening of shutter supporting portion communicate with each other.

The conveying screw Y is arranged in the conveying nozzle Y. When the driving part container rotating part Y inputs the rotation drive to a conveying screw gear Y the conveying screw Y rotates to convey the toner supplied in the conveying nozzle Y. A downstream end of the conveying nozzle Y in the conveying direction is connected to the toner dropping passage Y. The toner conveyed by the conveying screw Y falls along the toner dropping passage Y by gravity and is replenished to the developing device Y the second developer accommodating section Y .

The toner containers Y M C K are replaced with new ones at the end of their lifetimes when the containers become empty because almost all of the contained toner is consumed . Grippers Y M C K are arranged on one ends of the toner containers Y M C K opposite to the container front end covers Y M C K in the longitudinal direction in that is on the detachment direction Q sides. When the toner containers are to be replaced an operator can grip the grippers Y M C K to pull out and detach the toner containers Y M C K attached to the toner container holder .

The configuration of the driving part will be further described below with reference to . In symbols representing the colors are omitted. The driving part includes the container driving gear and the conveying screw gear . When a driving motor fixed to a mounting frame is driven and an output gear is rotated the container driving gear rotates. The conveying screw gear rotates by receiving the rotation of the output gear via a coupled gear .

As illustrated in the toner replenishing device Y controls the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y in accordance with the rotation frequency of the conveying screw Y. Therefore toner that passes through the conveying nozzle Y is directly conveyed to the developing device Y through the toner dropping passage Y without the need to control the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y. Even in the toner replenishing device Y configured to insert the conveying nozzle Y into the toner container Y as described in the embodiment it may be possible to arrange a temporary toner storage such as a toner hopper. In the toner replenishing devices M C K for the other colors the supply amount of toner is controlled in the same manner as in the toner replenishing device Y.

The toner containers Y M C K and the toner replenishing devices Y M C K according to the embodiment will be described in detail below. As described above the toner containers Y M C K and the toner replenishing devices Y M C K have almost the same configurations except that the colors of toner to be used are different. Therefore in the following descriptions symbols Y M C and K representing the colors of toner will be omitted.

The toner replenishing device includes the conveying nozzle in which the conveying screw is arranged and a nozzle shutter . The nozzle shutter is slidably mounted on the outer surface of the conveying nozzle so as to close the nozzle hole at the time of detachment which is before the toner container is attached in the state in and to open the nozzle hole at the time of attachment which is when the toner container is attached in the state in . The nozzle shutter includes a nozzle shutter flange serving as a flange on the downstream side in the attachment direction relative to an end surface of a nozzle receiver serving as a nozzle insertion member to be described later that comes in contact with the conveying nozzle .

As illustrated in a receiving opening which serves as a nozzle insertion opening into which the conveying nozzle is inserted at the time of attachment is provided in the center of the front end of the toner container and a container shutter which serves as an opening closing member that closes the receiving opening at the time of detachment is arranged.

As illustrated in the container receiving section arranged on the toner container holder is divided into four sections in a width direction W perpendicular to the longitudinal direction attachment detachment direction of the toner container and gutters serving as container mounting sections as illustrated in are provided so as to extend from the insertion hole part to the container cover receiving section along the longitudinal direction of the container bodies Y M C K . The toner containers Y M C K for the respective colors are able to move on the gutters in a sliding manner in the longitudinal direction.

As illustrated in on side surfaces and of the gutter which are opposite surfaces arranged in the width direction W the guide rails are arranged so as to face each other. The guide rails protrude in the width direction W from the respective side surfaces and extend in the longitudinal direction and are arranged in front of the container cover receiving section . The guide rails have functions to guide the container opening serving as the opening to a container setting section serving as a container receiving section by being fitted to sliding guides serving as guiding portions on the toner container side illustrated in when the toner container is attached to the printer the toner container holder and the toner replenishing device . Each of the guide rails is provided so as to be parallel to the rotation axis of the container body when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device .

As illustrated in the setting cover for each color is arranged on the container cover receiving section . The conveying nozzle is arranged in the center of the setting cover . The conveying nozzle is arranged so as to protrude from an end surface which is on the inner side in the attachment direction of the container setting section which is located on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container toward the upstream side in the attachment direction inside the container cover receiving section . The container setting section serving as the container receiving section is arranged in the protruding direction of the conveying nozzle that is toward the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container so as to surround the conveying nozzle . Specifically the container setting section is arranged at the base of the conveying nozzle and serves as a positioner to determine the position of the container opening relative to the toner container holder where the container opening functions as a rotational shaft when the rotary conveyor inside the toner container rotates to convey the toner contained in the toner container . Namely when the container opening is inserted in and mated to the container setting section the radial position of the container opening is determined.

When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device an outer surface of the container opening of the toner container is slidably mated to the container setting section . On an inner surface of the container setting section contact surfaces which are parts of the inner surface of the container setting section and which protrude inward in the radial direction from the inner surface of the container setting section are provided at four evenly spaced positions. The contact surfaces and the outer surface slide against each other with rotation of the toner container .

By the mating of the inner surface of the container setting section and the outer surface of the container opening of the toner container the position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device in the radial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction attachment detachment direction of the toner container is determined. Further when the toner container rotates the outer surface of the container opening functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of the container setting section functions as a bearing. In a indicates the position at which the outer surface of the container opening comes in sliding contact with the contact surfaces as the parts of the inner surface of the container setting section and at which the radial position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device is determined at this time.

In the descriptions below it is repeatedly explained that the outer surface of the container opening of the toner container and the container setting section mate with each other in a slidable manner. The mating state is in a precise sense a state in which the outer surface of the container opening of the toner container is in contact with the contact surfaces provided on the inner surface of the container setting section . Hereinafter for simplicity of explanation the mating will be referred to as mating the outer surface of the container opening with the inner surface of the container setting section by omitting the contact surfaces

As illustrated in holes are provided so as to face each other in the width direction W of the setting cover . On the setting cover replenishing device engaging members to be described later are arranged so as to be able to move back and forth from the outer surface to an inner surface side of the setting cover via the holes . The replenishing device engaging members are biased from the outer side to the inner side of the setting cover by biasing means such as torsion coil springs .

As illustrated in the toner container mainly includes the container body containing toner and includes the container front end cover . The container body is in the form of an approximate cylinder and rotates about a central axis of the cylinder as a rotation axis. Hereinafter one side of the toner container where the receiving opening is provided the side where the container front end cover is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the toner container may be referred to as a container front end . The other side of the toner container where the gripper is arranged the side opposite the container front end may be referred to as a container rear end . The longitudinal direction of the toner container is the rotation axis direction and corresponds to the horizontal direction when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device . The container rear end of the container body relative to the container gear has a greater outer diameter than that of the container front end and the spiral rib is provided on the inner surface of the container body . When the container body rotates in the arrow A direction in the figures a conveying force for moving toner from one end the container rear end to the other end the container front end in the rotation axis direction is applied to the toner in the container body due to the action of the spiral rib .

As illustrated in scooping portions which scoop up the toner conveyed to the container front end by the spiral rib along with the rotation of the container body in the arrow A direction in the figures are provided on the inner wall of the container front end of the container body . Each of the scooping portions scoops up toner which has been conveyed by the conveying force of the spiral rib by using a scooping wall surface along with the rotation of the container body . Therefore the toner can be scooped up so as to be located above the inserted conveying nozzle . As illustrated in for example a spiral rib of the scooping portion is formed in a spiral shape on the inner surface of each of the scooping portions in order to convey the internally located toner similarly to the spiral rib .

As illustrated in the container gear is provided on the container front side relative to the scooping portions on the container body . A gear exposing opening is arranged on the container front end cover so that a part of the container gear can be exposed when the container front end cover is attached to the container body . When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device the container gear exposed from the gear exposing opening meshes with a container driving gear of the toner replenishing device . The container gear is arranged on the container opening side near the container opening relative to the nozzle hole in the longitudinal direction of the container body such that the container gear can mesh with the container driving gear . The container gear meshes with the container driving gear to thereby rotate the rotary conveyor.

The container opening in the form of a cylinder is provided on the container front side relative to the container gear of the container body so as to be coaxial with the container gear . As illustrated in a nozzle receiver attachment portion of the nozzle receiver is press fitted to the container opening so as to be coaxial with the container opening so that the nozzle receiver is fixed to the container body . The toner container is configured such that toner is replenished from the container opening serving as the opening provided on one end of the container body and thereafter the nozzle receiver is attached to the container opening of the container body .

As illustrated in a cover hook stopper serving as a restrictor is provided between the container opening of the container body and the container gear . The cover hook stopper has a ring shape extending in the rotation direction circumferential direction on the front end of the container front end cover in the attachment direction. At least a part of the cover hook stopper is provided with openings to be described later with reference to each of which serves as a notch or a cutout for passage in a direction perpendicular to the circumferential direction. Namely the cover hook stopper is provided so as to surround the outer surface of the container opening . In the embodiment the direction perpendicular to the circumferential direction is the longitudinal direction attachment detachment direction .

The container front end cover is attached to the toner container the container body from the container front end from the bottom left side in . Therefore the container body penetrates through the container front end cover in the longitudinal direction and cover hooks serving as protrusions are engaged with the cover hook stopper serving as the restrictor. The container body and the container front end cover are attached so as to rotate relative to each other when the cover hooks are engaged with the cover hook stopper . The cover hooks are made of resin material.

Configurations of the cover hook stopper and the cover hooks will be described with reference to and . As described above the cover hook stopper serving as the restrictor provided on the container body includes the openings through which the cover hooks arranged on the container front end cover pass in the attachment detachment direction of the container body perpendicular to the rotation direction.

On a front surface of the container front end cover in the attachment direction Q a hole serving as a through hole is provided which penetrates in the attachment detachment direction of the container body and into which the container opening is inserted. The cover hooks are provided such that front ends A protrude toward the center of the hole . As indicated by a dashed line circle in tips of the front ends A protrude inward relative to the outer periphery of the hole

The openings are openings through which the cover hooks pass in the attachment detachment direction when the container body rotates relative to the container front end cover . In the first embodiment the three openings are provided on the cover hook stopper in the rotation direction. The openings are arranged such that spaces between the openings in the circumferential direction coincide with the spaces between cover hooks in the circumferential direction. In the first embodiment the three cover hooks and the three openings are provided in the rotation direction however it is sufficient that at least one cover hook and one opening are provided. illustrates a state into which the cover hooks are inserted in the cover hook stopper from a state into which the cover hooks are not inserted in the cover hook stopper as illustrated in . As illustrated in a center side surface of the front surface and a side surface of the cover hook stopper face each other. The cover hooks are thinner than the front surface in recessed toward the rear side relative to the front surface and the cover hooks and the cover hook stopper face each other in the attachment direction Q. Therefore the movement of the container front end cover relative to the container body in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q is restricted. The restriction involves allowing the cover hooks to move between the cover hook stopper and the container gear in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q in . Accordingly the container body becomes rotatable relative to the container front end cover .

In the first embodiment the rotation direction A is a direction in which the container front end cover rotates relative to the container body in the toner container attached to the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder and the attachment rotation direction R is a direction in which the container front end cover the cover hooks rotates relative to the container body when the container front end cover is attached to the container body . The three cover hooks and the three openings have the same configurations respectively therefore the configurations and operation of the single cover hook and the single opening will be described below as representatives. The outer diameter of the cover hook stopper is greater than the inner diameter of the hole in the center.

The container body and the container gear may be integrally formed. Alternatively the container body and the container gear may be separately formed depending on the resin material used for the container body . In this case as illustrated in the cover hook stopper is formed on the container gear the openings are formed on the cover hook stopper on the container gear and the container gear is attached to the container body in an integrated manner.

As illustrated in on the container front end cover of the toner container the sliding guides serving as guiding portions are provided on lower portions in the width direction W where the sliding guides restrict the toner container being attached from moving in directions other than the attachment direction to thereby guide the container opening to the container setting section when the toner container is attached to the printer . In only one of the sliding guides is illustrated. Each of the sliding guides includes a gutter extending in the longitudinal direction of the container body . The sliding guides are configured such that the guide rails as a pair provided on the gutters of the container receiving section as illustrated in are inserted in the respective gutters and sandwiched in the vertical direction. Therefore the sliding guides function as positioners of the container front end cover in the width direction W perpendicular to a vertical direction Z and the detachment direction Q when the toner container is attached to the printer the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder .

As illustrated in container engaging portions are provided on the surface of the container front end cover in the width direction W to determine the position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device in the longitudinal direction attachment detachment direction . In only one of the container engaging portions is illustrated. When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device the replenishing device engaging members see arranged on the setting covers are engaged with the container engaging portions .

As illustrated in each of the container engaging portions includes a guiding protrusion a guiding groove a bump and an engaging opening serving as an axial restrictor. A pair of the container engaging portions is arranged so as to be located on left and right sides of the container front end cover . Namely the engaging openings are arranged on the left and right sides across the center of the container opening . Each of the guiding protrusions is provided on the container front end of the container front end cover and located on a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container and on a horizontal plane passing through the rotation axis of the container body . Each of the guiding protrusions includes an inclined surface adjoined to each of the guiding grooves so as to come in contact with the replenishing device engaging members and to guide the replenishing device engaging members to the guiding grooves when the toner container is attached. The guiding grooves are grooves recessed from the side surface of the container front end cover .

The container rear ends of the guiding grooves are not directly connected to the respective engaging openings but are terminated and are located at the same height as the side surfaces of the container front end cover . Namely the outer surface of the container front end cover with a width of about 1 mm is exposed between each of the guiding grooves and each of the quadrangular engaging openings and this portion serves as the bump . The replenishing device engaging members pass over the bumps and fall in the engaging openings so that the toner container and the toner replenishing device are engaged with each other. This state is the set position set state of the toner container . In the embodiment the replenishing device engaging members are configured to fall in the engaging openings of the container engaging portions . However as the shapes of the container engaging portions in which the replenishing device engaging members falls to enable engagement between the toner container and the toner replenishing device through hole shapes like the engaging openings or recessed shapes such as non penetrating engaging portions in closed end shapes.

As illustrated in the driving part container rotating part inputs rotation drive to the container gear of the toner container via the container driving gear . When the drive is input to the container gear the outer surface of the container opening of the container body functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of the container setting section functions as a bearing so that the container body in which the container gear is attached or integrated rotates. In the first embodiment the rotation center of the container gear is located so as to be concentric with the axis of the container opening

In the state in which the toner container is held by the toner container holder the set state the outer surface of the container opening serving as the container front end of the toner container serves as the rotational shaft and is supported by the inner surface of the container setting section in the toner container and the engaging openings of the container engaging portions are engaged with the replenishing device engaging members . The container gear is arranged between the container engaging portions and the container opening

When the toner container is transported a cap serving as a seal to seal the container opening as illustrated in is attachable to the container opening on the container front end as illustrated in and . Therefore it is possible to prevent unexpected communication between the outside and the inside of the toner container to thereby prevent toner leakage deterioration of toner due to absorption of water from air into the toner or the like.

When the toner container is used for the first time the cap as described above is first detached. A state in which the cap is detached and the container opening is exposed is illustrated in .

On the container front end cover of the toner container as illustrated in a plurality of identification grooves to are arranged in addition to the above described components. Among the identification grooves to as illustrated in the identification grooves to are provided on the right side of the outer surface of the container front end cover with respect to a virtual line E passing through the rotation center of the toner container and a rib of the cover hook . The rib has a function to come in sliding contact with an upper part ceiling surface of the toner container holder when the toner container is attached to the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder and stably maintain the posture of the toner container . Further among the identification grooves to the identification grooves to are arranged on the left side of the outer surface of the container front end cover with respect to the virtual line E in . In reference signs of the identification grooves to are not illustrated because they are located on the rear side in the direction normal to the sheets of the figures.

Among the identification grooves to the identification grooves are grooves that linearly extend from the front surface of the container front end cover in the longitudinal direction of the toner container the detachment direction Q and are provided on an outer surface of the container front end cover . Further the identification grooves when viewed from front are concave portions that are shallowly recessed from the front surface toward the rear side in the figures relative to the identification grooves . A grid shaped rib with approximately the same height as the periphery of the outer surface is arranged in each of the identification grooves. Therefore the height of the periphery of the outer surface of the container front end cover varies in the circumferential direction because of the identification grooves to and the grid shaped ribs arranged in the identification grooves. The grid shaped ribs in the identification grooves are arranged in positions corresponding to types of toner or models of apparatuses to be attached. Therefore by combinations of the positions at which the grid shaped ribs arranged in the identification grooves to are provided in the circumferential direction irregularities corresponding to the types of toner or the models of apparatuses to be attached are formed and the grid shaped ribs function to provide information such as the type of the toner container to the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder .

As illustrated in the container engaging portions are arranged at symmetric positions which are separated by 180 degrees with respect to the virtual line E and have functions to engage the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder and the toner container when the toner container is attached to the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder . The container gear has a function to mesh with the gear on the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder after the toner container is attached to the copier the toner replenishing device and the toner container holder and appropriately and automatically rotate the cylindrical container body of the toner container .

As illustrated in the nozzle receiver is arranged on the toner container and includes the receiving opening serving as a nozzle insertion opening. The conveying nozzle for conveying toner supplied from the toner container in the image forming apparatus is inserted in the receiving opening . The nozzle receiver includes the container shutter serving as an opening closing member a container seal serving as a seal a container shutter supporter serving as a supporter a container shutter spring serving as a biasing member and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The container shutter is inserted in and supported by the container shutter supporter in a reciprocating manner so as to move to the opening position to open the receiving opening by being pressed with insertion of the conveying nozzle and to move a closing position to close the receiving opening with removal of the conveying nozzle . Namely the container shutter supporter supports the container shutter to guide the movement to the opening position and the closing position. The container shutter spring is a coil spring that is arranged inside the container shutter supporter and biases the container shutter toward the closing position.

The container shutter supporter includes a shutter rear end supporting portion as a shutter rear portion a pair of shutter side supporting portions as shutter side portions the openings of shutter supporting portion as side openings and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The shutter side supporting portions are arranged so as to face each other and extend along the moving direction of the container shutter . One ends of the shutter side supporting portions are connected by the shutter rear end supporting portion and the other ends are connected to the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion . The shutter side supporting portions and the openings of shutter supporting portion are arranged adjacent to each other in the rotation direction of the toner container. Namely the container shutter supporter has a shape in which cylindrical portions corresponding to the shutter side supporting portions from the nozzle receiver attachment portion side to the shutter rear end supporting portion are vertically cut out along the moving direction of the container shutter and the openings of shutter supporting portion are provided in the cutout portions. The container shutter supporter is configured such that the container shutter can move along the insertion direction of the conveying nozzle in a space S. The space S is enclosed by the pair of the shutter side supporting portions the shutter rear end supporting portion and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . In other words the container shutter supporter is configured to be able to guide the movement of the container shutter to the opening position to open the receiving opening and the closing position to close the receiving opening .

As illustrated in the nozzle receiver attached to the container body rotates with the container body when the container body rotates. At this time the shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver rotate around the conveying nozzle of the toner replenishing device . Therefore the shutter side supporting portions being rotated alternately pass a space just above the nozzle hole provided in the upper side of the conveying nozzle . Consequently even if toner is instantaneously accumulated above the nozzle hole because the shutter side supporting portions cross the accumulated toner and alleviate the accumulation it becomes possible to prevent cohesion of the accumulated toner when the apparatus is not used and prevent a toner conveying failure when the apparatus is resumed. In contrast when the shutter side supporting portions are located on the sides of the conveying nozzle and the nozzle hole and the opening of shutter supporting portion face each other toner in the container body is supplied to the conveying nozzle as indicated by an arrow in .

As illustrated in the container shutter includes a front cylindrical portion serving as a closure a slide area a guiding rod serving as an elongated portion and shutter hooks . The front cylindrical portion is a container front end portion to be tightly fitted to a cylindrical opening the receiving opening of the container seal . The slide area is a cylindrical portion serving as a gliding portion or a sealing portion which is provided on the container rear end relative to the front cylindrical portion . The slide area has an outer diameter slightly greater than that of the front cylindrical portion slides on the inner surfaces of the pair of the shutter side supporting portions and seals the receiving opening .

The guiding rod is a cylinder that stands from the inner side of the cylinder of the front cylindrical portion toward the container rear end and serves a rod portion that prevents the container shutter spring from being buckled when the guiding rod is inserted to the inside of the coil of the container shutter spring . A guiding rod sliding portion serving as a flat guiding portion includes a pair of flat surfaces that are provided on both sides across the central axis of the cylindrical guiding rod from the middle of the guiding rod . The container rear end of the guiding rod sliding portion is bifurcated into a pair of cantilevers as illustrated in . The shutter hooks are provided on ends of the cantilevers opposite to the base from which the guiding rod stands and form an engaging portion to be hooked on the container shutter supporter . The shutter hooks and the guiding rod sliding portion are inserted in a rear end opening serving as a through hole provided on the shutter rear end supporting portion and the shutter hooks are hooked on the rear end opening so that the shutter hooks and the guiding rod sliding portion serve as a pair of hooks that prevent the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter .

A front end of the container shutter spring abuts against an inner wall surface of the front cylindrical portion and a rear end of the container shutter spring abuts against an inner wall surface that is an opposite surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion . At this time the container shutter spring is in a compressed state so that the container shutter receives a biasing force in a direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion to the right or toward the container front end in . However the shutter hooks provided on the container rear end of the container shutter are hooked on the rear end opening of the shutter rear end supporting portion . Therefore the container shutter is prevented from moving further in the direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion in the state illustrated in .

Due to the hooked state between the shutter hooks and the shutter rear end supporting portion and the biasing force of the container shutter spring the position of the container shutter is determined. Specifically the positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal in the axial direction both of which have a toner leakage preventing function of the container shutter are determined relative to the container shutter supporter . Therefore it becomes possible to determine the positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal so that they can be fitted to each other enabling to prevent toner leakage.

As illustrated in the nozzle receiver attachment portion is in the form of a cylinder the outer diameter and the inner diameter of which are reduced in a stepped manner toward the container rear end. The diameters are gradually reduced from the container front end to the container rear end. As illustrated in two outer diameter portions outer surfaces AA and BB located in this order from the container front end are provided on the outer surface and five inner diameter portions inner surfaces CC DD EE FF and GG located in this order from the container front end are provided on the inner surface. The outer surfaces AA and BB on the outer surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. Similarly the fourth inner diameter portion FF and the fifth inner diameter portion GG on the inner surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. The inner diameter portion FF on the inner surface and the connected tapered surface correspond to a seal jam preventing space to be described later and the ridge lines of these surfaces correspond to sides of a pentagonal cross section to be described later.

As illustrated in the pair of the shutter side supporting portions which face each other and which have flake shapes obtained by cutting a cylinder in the axial direction protrude from the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The ends of the two shutter side supporting portions on the container rear side are connected by the shutter rear end supporting portion . The nozzle receiver attachment portion includes the inner diameter portion GG which is the fifth portion from the front end as a cylindrical inner surface having the same inner diameter as the diameter of the slide area of the container shutter . The third inner surface EE of the nozzle receiver attachment portion is a virtual periphery that passes through longitudinal tips of nozzle shutter positioning ribs that are equally spaced at 45 . The container seal with a quadrangular cylindrical cylindrical tube shaped cross section the cross section in the cross sectional view in is arranged so as to correspond to the inner surface EE. The container seal is fixed to a vertical surface connecting the third inner surface EE and the fourth inner surface FF with adhesive agent double stick tape or the like. The exposed surface of the container seal opposite to the attachment surface the right side in serves as an inner bottom of the cylindrical opening of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion the container opening .

Further as illustrated in the seal jam preventing space a catch preventing space is provided so as to correspond to the inner surface FF of the nozzle receiver attachment portion and the connected tapered surface. The seal jam preventing space is a ring shaped sealed space enclosed by three different parts. Specifically the seal jam preventing space is a ring shaped space enclosed by the inner surface the fourth inner surface FF and the connected tapered surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion the vertical surface on the attachment side of the container seal and the outer surface from the front cylindrical portion to the slide area of the container shutter . A cross section of the ring shaped space is in the form of a pentagon. The angle between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion and the end surface of the container seal and the angle between the outer surface of the container shutter and the end surface of the container seal are 90 .

Functions of the seal jam preventing space will be described below. When the container shutter moves toward the container rear end from the state in which the receiving opening is closed by the container shutter the inner surface of the container seal slides against the front cylindrical portion of the container shutter . Therefore the inner surface of the container seal is pulled by the container shutter and elastically deformed so as to move toward the container rear end. At this time if the seal jam preventing space is not provided and the vertical surface the attachment surface of the container seal continuing from the third inner surface is connected to the fifth inner surface GG so as to be perpendicular to each other the following situation may occur. Specifically the elastically deformed portion of the container seal may be caught between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion sliding against the container shutter and the outer surface of the container shutter resulting in causing a jam. If the container seal is jammed in the portion where the nozzle receiver attachment portion and the container shutter slide against each other that is between the front cylindrical portion and the inner surface GG the container shutter is firmly attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion so that the receiving opening may not be opened and closed.

In contrast the nozzle receiver according to the first embodiment is provided with the seal jam preventing space in the inner area thereof. The inner diameter of the seal jam preventing space the inner diameter of each of the inner surface EE and the connected tapered surface is smaller than the outer diameter of the container seal . Therefore the entire container seal can hardly be entered into the seal jam preventing space . Further an area of the container seal to be elastically deformed by being pulled by the container shutter is limited and the container seal can be restored by its own elasticity before the container seal is brought to and jammed at the inner surface GG. With this action it becomes possible to prevent a situation in which the receiving opening cannot be opened and closed because of the attached state between the container shutter and the nozzle receiver attachment portion .

As illustrated in the multiple nozzle shutter positioning ribs are provided so as to radially extend on the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion that comes in contact with the outer periphery of the container seal . When the container seal is attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion the vertical surface of the container seal on the container front side slightly protrudes relative to the front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs in the rotation axis direction.

As illustrated in when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter of the toner replenishing device presses and deforms the protruding portion of the container seal by being biased by a nozzle shutter spring . The nozzle shutter flange further moves inward and abuts against the container front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs thereby covering and sealing the front end surface of the container seal from the outside of the container. Therefore it becomes possible to ensure the sealing performance in the periphery of the conveying nozzle at the receiving opening in the attached state enabling to prevent toner leakage.

The back side of a biased surface of the nozzle shutter flange biased by the nozzle shutter spring abuts against the nozzle shutter positioning ribs so that the position of the nozzle shutter relative to the toner container in the rotation axis direction is determined. Therefore a positional relationship of the front end surface of the container seal the front end surface of a front end opening an inner space of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion arranged in the container opening as will be described later and the nozzle shutter in the rotation axis direction is determined.

The operation of the container shutter and the conveying nozzle will be described below with reference to . Before the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device as illustrated in the container shutter is biased by the container shutter spring toward the closing position so as to close the receiving opening . The appearance of the container shutter and the conveying nozzle at this time is illustrated in . When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device as illustrated in the conveying nozzle is inserted in the receiving opening . When the toner container is further pushed into the toner replenishing device an end surface of the front cylindrical portion which serves as an end surface of the container shutter hereinafter referred to as the end surface of the container shutter and an end surface located in the insertion direction of the conveying nozzle hereinafter referred to as the front end end surface of the conveying nozzle come in contact with each other. When the toner container is further pushed from the state as described above the container shutter is pushed as illustrated in . Accordingly as illustrated in the conveying nozzle is inserted in the shutter rear end supporting portion from the receiving opening . Therefore as illustrated in the conveying nozzle is inserted in the container body and located at the set position. At this time as illustrated in the nozzle hole is located at a position overlapping the opening of shutter supporting portion

Subsequently when the container body rotates toner scooped up above the conveying nozzle by the scooping portions falls in and is introduced into the conveying nozzle via the nozzle hole . The toner introduced into the conveying nozzle is conveyed inside the conveying nozzle toward the toner dropping passage along with the rotation of the conveying screw . Subsequently the toner falls in and is supplied to the developing device through the toner dropping passage .

A configuration of a conventional nozzle receiver will be described below with reference to and A to D. The same components as those of the nozzle receiver of the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference symbols.

Toner stored in the toner container serving as a toner bottle contains air and has predetermined fluidity just after the toner is sealed in the toner container . However the toner in the toner container is gradually deaerated and the fluidity is reduced during transportation or storage. Therefore it is preferable to shake the toner container to mix the internal toner and air to thereby obtain the predetermined fluidity just before the toner container is attached to the copier .

However in some cases the toner container may be inserted without being shaken just before the toner container is attached to the copier . In this case as illustrated in when the conveying nozzle is inserted in the nozzle receiver the container shutter starts to move. At this time toner with the reduced fluidity remains in the space S which is defined by the two shutter side supporting portions of the container shutter supporter that guides the container shutter and by the shutter rear end supporting portion of the container shutter supporter and in which the container shutter spring is held. Further in the conventional configuration as illustrated in the shutter rear end supporting portion is formed in a cylindrical shape and the projection area of the shutter rear end supporting portion is greater than the projection area of a rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter therefore toner is likely to be accumulated in the cylindrical portion. Further as illustrated in the projection area which is indicated by the gray shaded area of an end surface portion of the supporter from which the portions connected to the two shutter side supporting portions are excluded is made nearly equal to or slightly larger than the projection area in the same direction which is indicated by the hatched area of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter . Therefore the toner is pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and an opposite surface of the nozzle receiver facing the shutter rear end supporting portion .

At this time if the toner has the predetermined fluidity the toner can move away from the openings of shutter supporting portion . By contrast when the fluidity is low such as when the toner container is inserted without being shaken the toner is pressed and compressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and the opposite surface of the container shutter supporter the nozzle receiver facing the shutter rear end supporting portion as described above. When the toner container is further pushed the compressed toner enters between the slide area of the container shutter and the two shutter side supporting portions of the container shutter supporter the nozzle receiver . If the compressed and cohered toner enters between the slide area of the container shutter and the two shutter side supporting portions of the container shutter supporter the nozzle receiver as described above the container shutter is prevented from returning to the closing position when the toner container is detached from the copier . Consequently the toner container may be detached while the receiving opening remains open resulting in toner leakage.

In a first example of the first embodiment as illustrated in the container shutter supporter of the nozzle receiver is configured as described below. Specifically the end surface portion which serves as the end surface portion of supporter is provided on the shutter rear end supporting portion of the container shutter supporter . At the end surface portion portions other than the portions connected to the two shutter side supporting portions are opened. Namely when the portions is on both side of the end surface portion in the horizontal direction the portions other than the portions are opened in the vertical direction. The end surface portion is an opposite portion facing the rear end surface of the slide area

Specifically the container shutter includes the guiding rod serving as an elongated portion extending toward the end surface portion serving as the end surface portion of supporter.

The shutter rear end supporting portion includes the end surface portion which is a portion facing the rear end surface of the slide area and includes the rear end opening provided on the end surface portion . The end surface portion is integrally formed with the two shutter side supporting portions and the portions other than the portions connected to the shutter side supporting portions are opened. As illustrated in the shutter rear end supporting portion is configured such that within the projection area in the direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the container shutter of the shutter rear end supporting portion the projection area which is indicated by the gray shaded area of the end surface portion of the supporter from which the portions connected to the two shutter side supporting portions are excluded is smaller than the projection area in the same direction which is indicated by the hatched area of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter .

If the shutter rear end supporting portion of the container shutter supporter of the nozzle receiver is configured as described above the following advantage is achieved. Even when the container shutter moves with insertion of the conveying nozzle and then toner is moved by the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter a first part of the toner moves to the inside of the toner container without being compressed. The first part of the toner is toner moved by a region which is of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and which does not overlap with the end surface portion in the moving direction of the container shutter . Further a second part of the toner can easily move away from the opening of shutter supporting portion because the first part of the toner located nearby is moved. The second part of the toner is toner moved by a region which is of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and which overlaps with the end surface portion in the moving direction of the container shutter .

If the area of the shutter rear end supporting portion facing the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter is reduced and even when the toner container is attached to the copier while the fluidity of toner is low that is even when the toner container is attached without being shaken it is possible to reduce the possibility that the toner is pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion of the container shutter supporter of the nozzle receiver .

Meanwhile the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion functions as a bottom portion serving as a receiver of the container shutter spring that biases the container shutter toward the closing position. As illustrated in in the process of attaching the toner container in which the container shutter moves along with insertion of the conveying nozzle and the container shutter spring is compressed the end surface portion receives the restoring force of the container shutter spring . Therefore if the area of the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion is excessively reduced the strength of the container shutter supporter is reduced. If the strength is reduced components may be broken during the process of attaching the toner container .

Therefore as illustrated in a tapered surface as an inclined surface is provided along an opening edge of the rear end opening of the inner wall surface with which the container shutter spring on the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion comes in contact. illustrates an appearance of the container shutter supporter . is a cross sectional view cut along the line in . is an end view cut along the J J line in . The tapered surface is provided along the entire opening edge of the rear end opening which is tapered from the end surface portion toward the inside of the rear end opening . In other words on the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion the tapered surface is provided on the upstream surface in the moving direction in which a container shutter moves to the opening position along the entire circumference of the opening edge of the rear end opening

The tapered surface allows toner pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and the surface of the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion to easily move to the circumference as compared to a flat surface. Therefore if the tapered surface is maintained even if the area of the end surface portion the surface as a flat surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion and as the bottom portion of the container shutter spring is minimized it becomes possible to let the toner out while maintaining the strength.

Further in the first embodiment as illustrated in the container shutter supporter includes a protrusion that protrudes from the end surface portion in a longitudinal direction of the container shutter supporter. In other words the protrusion protrudes from the end surface portion in an opening direction of the opening closing member. The protrusion extends in a direction parallel to the moving direction of the container shutter and is arranged along the outer edge of a downstream surface a container rear end surface when the nozzle receiver is attached to the toner container in the moving direction in which the container shutter of the shutter rear end supporting portion moves toward the opening position.

With the above configurations of the tapered surface and the protrusion even when the projection area of the shutter rear end supporting portion is smaller than the projection area of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter it becomes possible to maintain the strength enough to prevent breakage when the restoring force due to the compression of the container shutter spring is applied to the container shutter supporter .

As illustrated in the flat guiding portion of the container shutter is provided so as to face the shutter side supporting portions vertical arrangement . The slide area of the container shutter slides by being guided by the two shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver and the strength in the non guided direction the strength parallel to the shutter side supporting portions is lower than the strength on the guided side. However by arranging the flat guiding portion of the container shutter so as to face the shutter side supporting portions vertical arrangement the strength against a force parallel to the shutter side supporting portions increases as compared to the configuration in which the flat guiding portion of the container shutter is arranged so as to face the openings of shutter supporting portion horizontal arrangement and therefore deformation due to the toner pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter and the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion of the nozzle receiver is less likely to occur which is advantageous.

Further as illustrated in on the pair of the shutter side supporting portions facing each other in the container shutter supporter stepped portions are provided so as to have mutually different widths in the moving direction of the container shutter . The shutter side supporting portions are divided into a first region Y and a second region Y which has a smaller width than the first region Y by the stepped portions . The second region Y is located on the shutter rear end supporting portion side and has a width corresponding to the diameter of the container shutter spring that is configured by a coil spring. Therefore it is possible to stably hold an end of the container shutter spring in the space S.

The configuration of the container shutter supporter is not limited to the configuration in which the stepped portions are arranged on the shutter side supporting portions . For example as illustrated in it is possible to employ a configuration that does not include the stepped portions on the shutter side supporting portions and does not include the regions Y and Y for the width.

A second example of the first embodiment will be described below. In the second example explanation of the same configurations as those of the first example will be omitted appropriately and the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols.

In the first example as described above if compressed and cohered toner enters between the slide area of the container shutter and the two shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver the container shutter may be prevented from returning to the closing position when the toner container is detached from the copier and the toner container may be detached while the receiving opening remains open resulting in toner leakage.

Therefore the present inventors have studied a compressed state caused by the container shutter . The compressed state caused by the container shutter will be described by the idea of a compression ratio. illustrates a state before compression by the container shutter . illustrates a state after compression. As illustrated in a distance from the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter to the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion in the closed state is assumed as a before compression distance L1. As illustrated in a distance from the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter to the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion in the opened state is assumed as an after compression distance L2. The compression ratio is simply assumed as L1 L2.

Specifically assuming that L1 denotes a distance in the case where the container shutter is at the closing position and L2 denotes a distance in the case where the container shutter is at the opening position with regard to the distance between the rear end surface of the slide area opposite to the end surface portion and the end surface portion L1 L2 is set to be greater than one and not greater than two.

Experiments on a toner cohesion state were performed in which the compression ratio L1 L2 was changed by changing the before compression distance L1 and the after compression distance L2. The results are illustrated in Table 1 below. In Table 1 a stroke indicates a stroke L1 L2 of the container shutter . The evaluation of the experiments is indicated by and x. indicates a state in which toner cohesion and toner leakage do not occur. indicates a state in which toner cohesion occurs but toner leakage does not occur. x indicates a state in which toner cohesion and toner leakage occur.

Through the experiments by the present inventors it is found that when L1 L2 the compression ratio is set to be greater than one and not greater than two it is possible to prevent a situation in which the compressed and cohered toner prevents the container shutter from returning to the closing position at the time of detachment of the toner container from the copier and the toner container is detached with the receiving opening remaining open resulting in toner leakage.

The advantageous effect of a change in the compression ratio is not limited to the combination of the container shutter supporter and the container shutter of the embodiment. For example as illustrated in even when the same is applied to a combination of the conventional container shutter supporter and the container shutter if L1 L2 the compression ratio is set to be greater than one and not greater than two it is possible to prevent a situation in which the compressed and cohered toner prevents the container shutter from returning to the closing position at the time of detachment of the toner container from the copier and the toner container is detached with the receiving opening remaining open resulting in toner leakage. In the before compression distance L1 is a distance from the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter to the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion in the closed state. As illustrated in the after compression distance L2 is a distance from the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter to the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion in the opened state.

A third example of the first embodiment will be described below. In the third example explanation of the same configurations as those of the first and the second examples will be omitted appropriately and the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols. Techniques according to the third example may preferably be implemented with the techniques described in the first and the second examples however even when the techniques according to the third example are implemented independently the same advantageous effects as described below can be achieved.

In each of the examples for convenience of assembly as illustrated in the container shutter and the container shutter spring are assembled with the container shutter supporter to fabricate the nozzle receiver and thereafter the nozzle receiver is assembled with the container body to fabricate the toner container .

The shutter hooks of the container shutter are hooked on the rear end opening of the container shutter supporter to prevent the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter . However during fabrication of the toner container as described above an external stress may be applied to the shutter hooks when the shutter hooks may bump against anything or may be touched by mistake and the shutter hooks may be elastically deformed resulting in causing the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter .

Further in a process of fabrication of the toner container the nozzle receiver may be fabricated in a different place and then conveyed or transported to assemble the nozzle receiver with the container body to fabricate the toner container . In this case when the nozzle receiver is conveyed or transported a packing material for packing the nozzle receiver may interfere with the shutter hooks or the packed nozzle receivers may interfere with each other. If a stress is applied to the shutter hooks due to the interference as described above the shutter hooks may be elastically deformed or broken resulting in causing the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter .

Therefore in the third example as illustrated in a protrusion amount height th of the protrusion which protrudes from the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion from the surface is set to be equal to or greater than a protrusion amount height th from the surface in the state in which the shutter hooks are hooked on the rear end opening . That is the progrusion protrudes more than the shutter hook in the opening direction of the opening closing member.

The protrusion is provided so as to protrude toward a downstream side in the moving direction in which the container shutter moves from the closing position to the opening position relative to the shutter hooks engaging portions when the container shutter serving as the opening closing member is located at the closing position.

As described above when the protrusion amount height th of the protrusion from the surface is set to be equal to or greater than the protrusion amount height th protruding from the surface when the shutter hooks are hooked on the rear end opening the peripheries of the shutter hooks are covered. Therefore an external stress is less likely to be applied to the shutter hooks so that it becomes possible to prevent the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter .

Further even when the nozzle receiver is conveyed or transported a packing material for packing the nozzle receiver is less likely to interfere with the shutter hooks or the packed nozzle receivers are less likely to interfere with each other so that it becomes possible to prevent the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter .

A second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the second embodiment the same configurations as those of the first embodiment will be omitted appropriately and the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols. Techniques according to the second embodiment may preferably be implemented with the techniques described in the first embodiment however even when the techniques according to the second embodiment are implemented independently the same advantageous effects as described below can be achieved. Further the second embodiment includes techniques according to fourth to eleventh examples to be described below.

In a comparative example illustrated in when the container front end cover and the container body are assembled by being attached to each other the container body is inserted in the container front end cover in the direction Q and the container body is moved in the attachment direction Q from the hole arranged in the center of the front surface of the container front end cover . In this case the tongue shaped cover hook is elastically deformed so as to spread from the cover hook stopper in the radial direction and then passes over the cover hook stopper so that the front end of the cover hook is hooked on a groove between the cover hook stopper and the container gear . The cover hook stopper is arranged along the entire circumferential direction and the outer diameter of the cover hook stopper is greater than the inner diameter of the hole . Therefore the container front end cover is restricted from moving in the direction Q but is held so as to rotate relative to the container body . As described above when the toner container is held by the toner container holder a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container front end cover . Therefore if the cover hook is configured so as to be easily attached elastically deformed to the cover hook stopper and when a pushing force is applied in the detachment direction Q the container body is easily detached from the container front end cover . By contrast if the cover hook is configured so as to be difficult to detach less deformable in order to prevent the container body from being easily detached from the container front end cover the cover hook is not easily attached to the cover hook stopper .

Therefore in the second embodiment as illustrated in the cover hook stopper provided on the container body includes the openings through which the cover hooks arranged on the container front end cover respectively pass in the attachment detachment direction of the container body perpendicular to the rotation direction. The cover hook stopper serves as a restrictor and the opening serves as a notch or a cutout.

Herein the attachment detachment direction of the container body is a direction in which the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing devices . However an attachment detachment direction of the container front end cover in which the container front end cover is attached to and detached from the toner container body is the same an opposite direction to the direction in which the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing devices . Therefore the term the attachment direction used in the second embodiment has two meanings the attachment direction of the container body and the detachment direction of the container front end cover . And the term the detachment direction used in the second embodiment has two meanings the detachment direction of the container body and the attachment direction of the container front end cover . Similarly the term the attachment direction Q used in the second embodiment has two meanings the attachment direction of the container body and the detachment direction of the container front end cover and the term the detachment direction Q used in the second embodiment has two meanings the detachment direction of the container body and the attachment direction of the container front end cover .

On the front surface of the container front end cover in the attachment direction Q the hole serving as a through hole is provided which penetrates in the attachment detachment direction of the container body and into which the container opening is inserted. The cover hooks are provided such that the inner ends A protrude toward the center of the hole . As indicated by the dashed line circle in the tips of the inner ends A protrude inward relative to the outer periphery of the hole . The cover hooks respectively pass through the openings in the attachment detachment direction when the container body rotates relative to the container front end cover . In the second embodiment the three openings are provided on the cover hook stopper in the rotation direction. The openings are arranged such that intervals between the openings in the circumferential direction coincide with the intervals between the cover hooks in the circumferential direction. In the second embodiment the three cover hooks and the three openings are provided in the rotation direction however it is sufficient that at least one cover hook and one opening are provided. illustrates a state into which the cover hook is inserted in the cover hook stopper from the state illustrated in . As illustrated in a center side portion of the front surface and a outer side surface of the cover hook stopper face each other. The cover hooks are thinner than the front surface in recessed toward the rear side relative to the front surface and the cover hooks and the cover hook stopper face each other in the attachment direction Q. Therefore the movement of the container front end cover relative to the container body in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q is restricted. The restriction involves allowing the cover hooks to move between the cover hook stopper and the container gear in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q in . Accordingly the container body becomes rotatable relative to the container front end cover .

Namely in the configuration of the powder container described using the comparative example the protrusion provided on the holder is elastically deformed in the radial direction so as to be hooked on the restrictor of the powder storage. Therefore if the protrusion is configured to be easily detached or be difficult to detach it becomes difficult to hook the restrictor on the protrusion resulting in the reduced operability.

Therefore the powder container according to the second embodiment includes a cylindrical powder storage to contain powder a holder attachable to and detachable from the powder storage a protrusion that is on one of the powder storage and the holder and a restrictor that is on the other one of the powder storage and the holder and is to restrict the movement of the protrusion in the longitudinal direction of the powder storage. The powder storage is to rotate relative to the holder. The restrictor includes an opening through which the protrusion passes in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction when the holder is attached to the powder storage.

According to the second embodiment the protrusion is provided on one of the powder storage and the holder that are rotatable relative to each other and a restrictor on which the protrusion is hooked and which extends in the rotation direction is provided on the other one of the powder storage and the holder. Further the restrictor includes the opening through which the protrusion passes in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction. Therefore after the protrusion has passed through the opening the hooked state between the opening and the protrusion is maintained. Consequently it becomes possible to attach the protrusion to the restrictor without reducing the operability enabling to prevent the protrusion from easily coming off as compared to the conventional configuration.

Specific configurations of the cover hook and the opening will be described in each of the examples below. In the examples a rotation direction A is a direction in which the container front end cover rotates relative to the container body in the toner container attached to the image forming apparatus and an attachment rotation direction R is a direction in which the container front end cover the cover hooks rotates relative to the container body when the container front end cover is attached to the container body . The three cover hooks and the three openings have the same configurations respectively therefore the configurations and operation of the single cover hook and the single opening will be described as representatives. The outer diameter of the cover hook stopper is equal to or greater than the inner diameter of the hole in the center.

In the cover hook stopper having a thickness in the attachment detachment direction an end surface located in the attachment direction Q serves as a guiding surface toward the opening when the container front end cover is attached to the container body and an end surface located in the detachment direction Q serves as a guiding surface toward the opening at the time of detachment.

The cover hook serving as the protrusion includes an inclined portion of the protrusion on an end surface serving as an end located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. The inclined portion of the protrusion is inclined upward from the downstream side to the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. The inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface with a flat top surface. A surface of the cover hook that is continued from the inclined portion is referred to as a bottom surface of the cover hook which serves as a second surface of the protrusion. The bottom surface faces the end surface in the attachment operation of the container cover to the container body . A surface of the cover hook that is continued from the inclined portion and located on the side opposite to the bottom surface of the cover hook is referred to as an upper surface of the cover hook which serves as a first surface of the protrusion.

In the cover hook the bottom surface of the cover hook and the upper surface of the cover hook serve as parallel planes parallel to each other. It is preferable that the bottom surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper are parallel to each other in the state before the container front end cover is attached to the container body as illustrated in . It is also preferable that the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface are parallel to each other in the state in which the container front end cover is attached to the container body . As illustrated in the width length of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by c the width length of the upper surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by e and the thickness between the bottom surface of the cover hook and the upper surface of the cover hook which is the thickness of the cover hook in the attachment detachment direction is denoted by d . In the cover hook as illustrated in a width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook i.e. a length of the bottom surface in the rotation direction R is greater than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook . The cover hook has a trapezoidal cross section in which the inclined portion serves as an inclined surface inclined downward from the upper surface of the cover hook to the bottom surface of the cover hook with respect to the rotation direction. In the descriptions below it is assumed that the configuration of the cover hook is the same in the fourth to the seventh examples.

A surface located on the downstream side of the opening in the attachment rotation direction R serves as an opening inclined portion inclined in the same direction as the inclined portion of the protrusion. The opening includes an opposite surface facing the opening inclined portion . The opposite surface is an inclined surface. In the fourth example the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface are parallel planes parallel to each other.

As illustrated in in the opening an interval between the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface is denoted by t the width length of the opening on a first port side on the end surface side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by a and the width length of the opening on a second port side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by b . The first port serves as an outlet port a downstream end port an outlet or a first portion of the opening . The second port serves as an inlet port an upperstream end port an inlet or a second portion of opening . The second port of the opening is one end of the opening opened on the end surface and is located on the upstream side in the direction in which the protrusion passes through the opening when the container front end cover serving as the holder is attached to the container body serving as a powder storage. The first port of the opening is the other end of the opening opened on the end surface and is located on the downstream side in the direction in which the protrusion passes through the opening when the container front end cover is attached to the container body . In the fourth example the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening and the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . When the inclined portion of the cover hook is located above the second port of the opening the cover hook is pressed toward the opening from the upstream side to the downstream side in the detachment direction Q as illustrated in . Accordingly the cover hook slightly deforms counterclockwise in the figures toward the inside of the opening by using an end S of the second port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as a pivot and enters the opening with the inclined portion of the protrusion in the lead as illustrated in . Subsequently as illustrated in an end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by an end S of the second port of the opening located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening is satisfied the cover hook passes through the opening as illustrated in and . When an upstream end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R passes by an end S of the first port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook is located such that the upper surface and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time if the length of an interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q of the container body is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

As described above when the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the first port of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other after the container front end cover is attached to the container body the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

The opening provided on the cover hook stopper according to the fifth example differs from the opening according to the fourth embodiment. The opening includes an opening inclined portion and an opposite surface inclined in the same direction as the opening inclined portion . In the fifth example the opposite surface is a surface moderately inclined by an acute angle which is smaller than that of the opening inclined portion from the downstream side to the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. Therefore in the fifth example in the opening a width b of a second port of the opening on the end surface side and the width a of a first port side on the end surface side differ from each other. The first port serves as an outlet port a downstream end port an outlet or a first portion of the opening . Therefore in the fifth example an interval t between the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface corresponds to the minimum interval between the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface and the dimension thereof corresponds to a dimension between an extended line of the opening inclined portion and a line that extends from the opposite surface so as to be parallel to the extended line. That is the opening includes the opposite surface as a guiding portion inclined from the upstream side to the downstream side in the detachment direction Q on the second port of the opening side.

The width of the opening on the first port side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by a and the width of the opening on the second port side which serves as an inlet port an upperstream end port an inlet or a second portion of opening in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by b . The second port of the opening corresponds to the width of one end of the opening opened on the end surface and the first port corresponds to the width of the other end of the opening opened on the end surface . Even in the fifth example the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening and the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . When the cover hook is located above the second port of the opening the cover hook is pressed toward the opening as illustrated in . Accordingly because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

When the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook rotates counterclockwise in the figures by using an end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as a pivot on the opposite surface as illustrated in . Subsequently as illustrated in the end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by an end S of the second port of the opening located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening is satisfied the cover hook passes through the opening as illustrated in . When the upstream end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R passes by an end S of the first port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook is located such that the upper surface and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time if the length of the interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

When the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper as described above an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the first port of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

Further in the fifth example because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

The opening provided on the cover hook stopper according to the sixth example differs from the openings according to the above described examples. The opening includes an opening inclined portion and an opposite surface which is inclined in the same direction as and parallel to the opening inclined portion . The opening includes a concave portion which serves as a guiding portion a depressed portion or a recess and which is provided in a second port of the opening on the end surface side so as to be recessed in the detachment direction Q. The concave portion includes a first surface which is parallel to the end surface and continued to the opposite surface and includes a second surface which is connected to the first surface and the end surface . The second surface is a surface inclined downward from the upstream side to the downstream side in the detachment direction Q from the end surface

In the sixth example in the opening an interval between the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface is denoted by t the width of the opening on a first port side on the end surface side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by a and the width of the opening on in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by b . The first port serves as an outlet port. The second port serves as an inlet port an upperstream end port an inlet or a second portion of opening . The second port of the opening corresponds to a width between an end S which is defined by the opening inclined portion and the end surface and an end S which is defined by the second surface and the end surface in the attachment rotation direction R and this width is assumed as the width b of the guiding portion in the rotation direction.

Further the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . When the cover hook is located above the guiding portion of the second port of the opening the cover hook is pressed toward the opening as illustrated in . Accordingly because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

When the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook rotates counterclockwise in the figures on the second surface by using the end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as a pivot as illustrated in . Subsequently during the rotation as illustrated in the bottom surface of the cover hook comes in contact with an end S of the second port and the cover hook further rotates counterclockwise.

As illustrated in the end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by an end S defined by the opening inclined portion and the end surface located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening the cover hook passes through the opening as illustrated in . When the upstream end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R passes by the end S of the first port of the opening the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time if the length of the interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

When the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper as described above an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the guiding portion of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

The opening provided on the cover hook stopper according to the seventh example differs from the openings according to the above described examples. The opening includes an opening inclined portion and an opposite surface which is inclined in the same direction as and parallel to the opening inclined portion . The opening includes a concave portion which serves as a guiding portion a depressed portion or a recess and which is provided in a second port of the opening on the end surface side so as to be recessed in the detachment direction Q. The concave portion includes a first surface which is parallel to the end surface and continued to the opposite surface and includes a second surface which is connected to the first surface and the end surface

In the seventh example in the opening an interval between the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface is denoted by t the width of the opening on the end surface side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by a and the width of the opening on the second port side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by b . The first port serves as an outlet port a downstream end port an outlet or a first portion of the opening . The second port serves as an inlet port an upperstream end port an inlet or a second portion of opening . The second port of the opening corresponds to the width between an end S which is provided by the opening inclined portion and the end surface and the second surface in the attachment rotation direction R and this width is assumed as the width b of the guiding portion in the rotation direction R. An end which is defined by the opposite surface and the first surface and an end S which is defined by the second surface and the end surface are chamfered in arc shapes.

Further the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . When the cover hook is located above the guiding portion of the second port of the opening the cover hook is pressed toward the opening as illustrated in . Accordingly because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

When the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion as illustrated in the bottom surface of the cover hook comes in contact with an end S of the first port and the cover hook rotates counterclockwise in the figures. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening is satisfied the end S which is defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by an end S defined by the opening inclined portion and the end surface on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. Further as illustrated in the cover hook passes through the opening and the upstream end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R passes by an end S of the first port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as illustrated in . Accordingly as illustrated in the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface face each other. At this time if the length of the interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

When the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper as described above an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the first port of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening .

Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

In the fifth to the seventh examples the cover hook is pressed and entered into the opening similarly to the fourth example however it is not limited thereto. As illustrated in a configuration may be such that the cover hook enters the opening when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R while the container front end cover is brought into contact with the cover hook stopper . For example as illustrated in the bottom surface protrudes downward by f relative to the end surface . When the container body is inserted in the container front end cover and abuts against the cover hook stopper the cover hook is elastically deformed in the Q direction . Because the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook is set to be smaller than the width b of the second port of each of the openings when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R from the state illustrated in and the cover hook is located on the second port side of each of the openings the cover hook starts to fall with movement in the attachment rotation direction R . Therefore it becomes possible to easily engage the cover hook with the cover hook stopper by only rotating the container front end cover rather than pressing the container front end cover including the cover hook in the detachment direction Q as in the fourth example. Consequently attachment operability can be improved. are applied to the opening of the sixth example however they are applicable to the openings of the fifth and the seventh examples.

Next eighth to tenth examples will be described. In the eighth to the tenth examples an opening provided on the cover hook stopper is the same as the opening of the fourth example and the shape of a cover hook which serves as a protrusion and is provided on the container front end cover side is different. In the descriptions below it is assumed that the relationship between the cover hook and the front surface is the same as the relationship illustrated in however the relationships described in the fourth to the seventh examples are applicable.

In the eighth example the cover hook includes an inclined portion of the protrusion which is inclined in the attachment rotation direction R on the end surface serving as an end located in the attachment rotation direction R. The inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface with a flat top surface. A surface of the cover hook which is continued from the inclined portion and faces the end surface is referred to as a bottom surface of the cover hook . The bottom surface serves as a second surface of the protrusion. A surface of the cover hook which is continued from the inclined portion and located on the side opposite to the bottom surface of the cover hook is referred to as an upper surface of the cover hook . The upper surface serves as a first surface of the protrusion. A surface located opposite to the inclined portion of the protrusion is referred to as a side surface of the cover hook .

The inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface parallel to the opening inclined portion and the side surface of the cover hook is provided as an inclined surface inclined by an acute angle with respect to the attachment rotation direction R rather than being parallel to the opening inclined portion . Further the width of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by c the width of the upper surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by e and the thickness between the bottom surface and the upper surface of the cover hook which is the thickness of the cover hook in the attachment detachment direction is denoted by d . In the cover hook the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook is greater than the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook . The cover hook has a trapezoidal cross section in which the inclined portion of the protrusion serves as an inclined surface inclined downward in the detachment direction Q from the upper surface of the cover hook to the bottom surface of the cover hook with respect to the attachment rotation direction R.

In the eighth example the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . As illustrated in when the cover hook is located above the second port the opening because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

When the side surface of the cover hook comes in contact with the end S the cover hook rotates counterclockwise by using the contact point as a pivot as illustrated in . Then an end S which is defined by the inclined portion of the protrusion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by the end S on the insertion side which is defined by the opening inclined portion and the end surface on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening is satisfied the side surface of the cover hook is guided by the opposite surface and passes through the opening as illustrated in . When an upstream end S of the upper surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R passes by the end S of the first port of the opening located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time if the length of an interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

When the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper as described above an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the first port of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening .

Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

In the ninth example a shape of an upstream portion of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R differs from that of the eighth example.

An inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface parallel to the opening inclined portion . A side surface of the cover hook is provided so as to be recessed in the attachment rotation direction R rather than being parallel to the opening inclined portion . The recessed portion includes a first surface that is continued from the side surface and parallel to the end surface and a second surface that connects the first surface and a bottom surface of the cover hook which serves as a second surface of the protrusion.

In the cover hook the width of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by c the width of an upper surface of the cover hook which serves as a first surface of the protrusion in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by e and the thickness between the bottom surface and the upper surface of the cover hook which is the thickness of the cover hook in the attachment detachment direction is denoted by d . In the cover hook the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook is greater than the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook . The inclined portion of the protrusion is provided as an inclined surface inclined downward in the detachment direction Q from the upper surface of the cover hook to the bottom surface of the cover hook .

In the ninth example the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . As illustrated in when the cover hook is located above the second port of the opening because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

When the end S comes in contact with the opposite surface the cover hook rotates counterclockwise by using the contact point as a pivot as illustrated in . Then an end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by the end S on the insertion side which is defined by the opening inclined portion and the end surface located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. When the cover hook further rotates counterclockwise an end S defined by the side surface and the first surface of the cover hook comes in contact with the end S of the second port of the opening as illustrated in . Then the cover hook rotates counterclockwise by using the contact portion as a pivot. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening is satisfied the end S of the cover hook is guided by the opposite surface and passes through the opening as illustrated in . When the end S of the cover hook passes by the end S of the first port of the opening located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time if the length of an interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

When the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper as described above an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the first port of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring or a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

In the tenth example a shape of a recessed portion of the cover hook differs from that of the ninth example. Other configurations are the same as those of the ninth example and therefore detailed explanation thereof will be omitted.

The recessed portion includes a first surface that is continued from a side surface and parallel to the end surface a second surface that is continued to a bottom surface and a third surface that connects the first surface and the second surface . The third surface has a curved surface shape.

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening is illustrated in . The entering operation illustrated in is the same as the entering operation illustrated in therefore explanation thereof will be omitted.

In the eleventh example the cover hook includes an inclined portion of the protrusion which is inclined in the attachment rotation direction R on the end surface serving as an end located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. The inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface with a flat top surface. A first surface is provided so as to be connected to an end of the inclined portion . The first surface includes a standing surface standing in a direction perpendicular to the attachment rotation direction R. A bottom surface of the cover hook which serves as a second surface of the protrusion faces the end surface . A surface which is continued from the inclined portion of the protrusion and located opposite to the bottom surface of the cover hook is referred to as an upper surface of the cover hook . The upper surface serves as a first surface of the protrusion. An inclined surface opposite to the inclined portion of the protrusion serves as a side surface of the cover hook . A second surface parallel to the first surface is provided between the side surface and the upper surface of the cover hook .

In the cover hook the width of the bottom surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by c the width of the upper surface of the cover hook in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by e and the thickness between the bottom surface and the upper surface of the cover hook which is the thickness of the cover hook in the attachment detachment direction is denoted by d . In the cover hook the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook and the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook are the same.

In the eleventh example the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening the relation of the width a of the first port of the opening 

The entering operation of the cover hook at the opening configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in when the container front end cover is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R the cover hook moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . As illustrated in when the cover hook is located above the second port of the opening because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

When the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook rotates counterclockwise in the figures by using an end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as a pivot on the opposite surface . Subsequently as illustrated in an end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook passes by the end S of the second port of the opening located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time because the relation of the thickness d of the cover hook the interval t of the opening is satisfied the end S of the cover hook comes in contact with the opening inclined portion and the cover hook passes through the opening as illustrated in . At this time the cover hook rotates clockwise by using the contact portion between the opening inclined portion and the end S as a pivot. As illustrated in the end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook passes by the end S of the first port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. Accordingly the side surface of the cover hook rotating clockwise passes through the first port and the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time if the length of an interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port rotational displacement of the cover hook in the opening is smoothly performed which is preferable.

That is the opening is configured such that the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion the cover hook passes through the opening .

When the cover hook passes through the opening that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper as described above an engaged state is obtained in which the upper surface of the cover hook and the end surface of the cover hook stopper face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body and the container front end cover and simplify the assembly and attachment.

Further the width a of the first port of the opening is smaller than the width e of the upper surface of the cover hook so that even when the opening and the cover hook face each other the cover hook does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore for example when the toner container is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device and even if a stress restoring force for compressing the container shutter spring and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container the container body and the container front end cover are not detached from each other. Consequently it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container is attached and detached.

Further in the eleventh example because the relation of the width c of the bottom surface of the cover hook 

In the fourth to the eleventh examples the attachment rotation direction R of the container front end cover with respect to the container body and the rotation direction A of the container body with respect to the container front end cover in the toner container attached to the image forming apparatus are opposite to each other. Therefore even when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device and the container body is rotated if each of the cover hooks has passed through each of the openings in the detachment direction Q and is maintained in the engaged state each of the cover hooks is prevented from coming off from the cover hook stopper . For example with reference to if the container body rotates in the rotation direction A relative to the container front end cover the cover hook stopper moves from the left to the right in the figure. In this case even if a bottom end of the opening inclined portion comes in contact with the inclined portion of the protrusion the cover hook stopper moves upward with the aid of the inclined surface of the opening inclined portion . Therefore rotation of the container body relative to the container front end cover is not restricted.

Further when the container body and the container front end cover are rotated in the direction opposite to the assembly direction and if the container body is rotated in the rotation direction while being pressed toward the attachment direction Q it is possible to easily guide each of the cover hooks to the inside of each of the openings from the end surface side. Therefore the container body and the container front end cover can easily be detached when they are separated from each other. Consequently the recyclability can be improved.

In the fourth to the eleventh examples the end surface of the cover hook stopper is assumed as the same plane except for the openings. However a portion of the end surface on the upstream side in the rotation direction relative to the opening inclined portion may be provided so as to be lower in height than an end of the opening inclined portion on an insertion side in the detachment direction. In other words when the cover hook stopper is viewed with the second port of the opening facing upward a portion of the cover stopper on the upstream side in the rotation direction relative to the opening is lower in height than the end of the opening inclined portion on the second port side. In in the configuration of the fourth example an end surface located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R relative to the opening is provided such that the height thereof in the detachment direction Q is lower than that of the opening inclined portion side.

As described above if the end surface located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R relative to the opening is provided such that the height thereof in the detachment direction Q is lower than that of the opening inclined portion side the inclined portion of the cover hook and the opening inclined portion face each other when the container front end cover is rotated. Therefore it becomes not necessary to press the cover hook in the detachment direction Q when the container body and the container front end cover are assembled enabling to improve the operability.

The cover hooks to and the opening to described in the above described examples can be used in various combinations. For example the combination of the opening illustrated in and the cover hooks illustrated in can be used.

In the above described examples the container body and the container gear are integrally formed. However the container body and the container gear may be separately formed depending on the resin material used for the container body . In this case as illustrated in the cover hook stopper is provided on the container gear any of the above described openings is provided on the cover hook stopper on the container gear and the container gear is attached to the container body in an integrated manner.

In the above described examples the restrictor and the opening are provided on the container body and the cover hook is provided on the container front end cover . However an arrangement opposite to those of the examples may be employed by providing the restrictor and the opening on the container front end cover and providing the cover hook on the container body . In the single opening is provided on the front surface in the attachment direction so as to face the hole of the container front end cover the cover hook stopper is provided on the outer surface of the container opening of the container body in the rotation direction circumferential direction and the single cover hook is provided on the cover hook stopper .

In the above described examples the powder container of the image forming apparatus has been explained as an application example of the configuration which includes the protrusion of the embodiments the restrictor that extends in the rotation direction and that is hooked on the protrusion and the opening provided on the restrictor through which the protrusion can pass in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction.

However the present invention is not limited to the image forming apparatus and the powder container used in the image forming apparatus. For example in a supporting device as illustrated in a through hole is provided on a plate shaped frame serving as a first member and a restrictor is provided on a bearing serving as a second member that is detachably attached to the through hole of the frame and that rotatably supports a shaft on which a gear is mounted. The restrictor also functions as a mounting flange of the bearing . A hook serving as a protrusion is provided on the restrictor and an opening through which the hook can pass in a direction perpendicular to the rotation direction is provided on the through hole .

With this configuration as illustrated in the restrictor of the bearing is inserted in the through hole from a surface on one side of the frame and is then rotated. Accordingly the hook passes through the opening from the surface to a surface on the other side of the frame and the hook is engaged with and attached to the other surface of the frame so that the hooked state is maintained. Therefore it is possible to ensure the attached state of the frame and the bearing .
