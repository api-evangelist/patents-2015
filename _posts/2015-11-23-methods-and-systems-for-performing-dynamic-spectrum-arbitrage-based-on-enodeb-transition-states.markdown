title: Methods and systems for performing dynamic spectrum arbitrage based on eNodeB transition states
abstract: A dynamic spectrum arbitrage (DSA) system may include a dynamic spectrum policy controller (DPC) and a dynamic spectrum controller (DSC) that together dynamically manage the allocation and use of resources (e.g., spectrum resources) across different networks. The DSC and/or DPC components may be configured to monitor a congestion state of an eNodeB, and intelligently allocate resources, manage user traffic of the eNodeBs, select target eNodeBs for handovers, determine the quality of service (QoS) levels that are to be given to wireless devices attached to the eNodeBs, and/or perform other similar operations to intelligently manage the allocation and use of resources by the various networks. The DPC and/or DSC components may be also configured to perform these and other operations based on the transitions, changes, transition rates, or rates of change in the congestion levels of the network components.

With the ever increasing use of wireless communication devices for accessing networks and downloading large files e.g. video files there is an increasing demand for radio frequency spectrum. Smart phone users complain about dropped calls slow access to the Internet and similar problems which are due largely to too many devices trying to access finite RF bandwidth allocated to such services. Yet parts of the RF spectrum such as the RF bands dedicated to emergency services e.g. police fire and rescue etc. go largely unused due to the non continuous and episodic employment of such voice radio communication bands. Therefore improved methods and solutions for dynamically allocating underutilized telecommunication resources e.g. RF spectrum etc. of a first telecommunication network for access and use by wireless devices that subscribe to other networks will be beneficial to the telecommunication networks service providers and to the consumers of telecommunication services.

The various embodiments include methods of managing the allocation access or use of a telecommunication resource by monitoring in a processor of a first dynamic spectrum controller DSC of a first telecommunication network a congestion state of an eNodeB in the first telecommunication network and controlling the use of the eNodeB based on the congestion state of the eNodeB.

It should be understood that any references to terminology and or technical details related to an individual telecommunication standard or technology are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims to a particular communication system or technology unless specifically recited in the claim language.

The various embodiments include a dynamic spectrum arbitrage DSA system for dynamically managing the availability allocation access and use of telecommunication resources such as radio frequency RF spectrum and RF spectrum resources between two or more networks e.g. between a lessor network and a lessee network . The DSA system may include a dynamic spectrum policy controller DPC component configured to manage the operations and interactions between the participating networks. For example the DPC component may be configured to communicate with dynamic spectrum controller DSC components in each of the participating networks to identify the resources that are available for allocation determine the amount of resources that are available for allocation and to allocate all or a portion of the available resources of a first participating network i.e. a lessor network for access and use by equipment devices e.g. wireless device UE etc. in a second participating network i.e. a lessee network .

In the various embodiments the DPC and or DSC component may be configured to perform these and other DSA operations based on the current congestion levels of the components in the participating networks. In further embodiments the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform DSA operations based on based on the transitions changes transition rates or rates of change in the congestion levels.

In an embodiment the DSC may be configured to receive congestion state information from eNodeBs in its network and send the congestion state information to a DPC component. The congestion state information may identify a current congestion state e.g. Normal Minor Major Critical etc. of an eNodeB a plurality of eNodeBs and or other network components. Each congestion state may be associated with a congestion level. For example a Normal congestion state may indicate that a network component e.g. eNodeB etc. is operating under normal load e.g. user traffic is within the normal operating rages etc. . A Minor congestion state may indicate that the network component is experiencing congestion and or operating under an above average load. A Major congestion state may indicate that the network component is experiencing significant congestion and or operating under heavy load. A Critical congestion state may indicate that the network component is experiencing severe congestion experiencing an emergency situation or operating under an extremely heavy load.

In the various embodiments the DSC and or DPC components may be configured to use the congestion state information to intelligently allocate resources manage user traffic of the eNodeBs select target eNodeBs for handovers determine the quality of service QoS levels that are to be given to wireless devices attached to the eNodeBs and or perform other similar operations to intelligently manage the allocation and use of resources by the various networks.

For example in an embodiment a DPC component may be configured to instruct a DSC component in a lessee network i.e. a network using a resource allocated by another network to disable further handovers to an eNodeB of a lessor network i.e. the network that allocated the resource in response to determining that the eNodeB is currently under heavy load. In this manner the DPC may reduce or mitigate user traffic levels of the lessor eNodeB so that it may continue to provide adequate service to its primarily users i.e. subscribers of the lessor network . As such the DPC may encourage the lessor network to more readily allocate its available resources e.g. implement more aggressive resource allocation schemes to other networks by assuring the allocated resources will be intelligently managed quickly returned and or otherwise made available to the primary users subscribers when needed.

In further embodiments the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to intelligently determine select the operations that are to be performed based on transitions or changes in the congestion levels states of the eNodeBs. That is the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform different operations or different sets of operations based on the rates in which the congestion levels change or the severity of the changes. These embodiments allow the DSA system to better respond to changing network conditions emergency situations and or significant changes in congestion levels. For example the embodiments allow the DSA system to forgo performing certain operations that would otherwise be performed if the state changes were more incremental severe or perform operations that would not be otherwise be performed if the changes were more incremental severe.

As mentioned above the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform different sets of operations based on the state transitions or severity of the changes in congestion levels of the eNodeBs. For example the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a first set of operations in response to determining that an eNodeB transitioned from a Normal congestion state to a Minor congestion state a second set of operations in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Normal congestion state to a Major congestion state a third set of operations in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Normal congestion state to a Critical congestion state. These operation sets i.e. the first second and third operation sets may be progressive incremental cumulative or completely independent of one another. For example the first operation set may be a subset of the second operation set or may include a completely different and independent set of operations.

In an embodiment the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a normal to minor operation set in response to determining that an eNodeB transitioned from a Normal congestion state to a Minor congestion state. The normal to minor operation set may include the lessor DSC instructing a lessee DSC e.g. via the DPC to disable further handovers to components in lessor network. Alternatively or in addition the lessor DSC may identify wireless devices for which handovers should be restricted determine closed subscriber group identifiers CSG ids for the identified wireless devices and instruct the lessee DSC via the DPC to disable roaming for the wireless devices associated with the identified CSG ids. This may cause the lessee DSC to instruct a home Mobility Management Entity MME to disable CSG ids corresponding to lessor resources that are allocated to and or in use by the identified wireless devices. That is the MME may restrict handovers for select wireless devices when the eNodeB transitions from a Normal congestion state to a Minor congestion state. In this manner the DSA system may mitigate or reduce user traffic on the congested eNodeB.

The DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a normal to major operation set in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Normal congestion state to a Major congestion state. This operation set may include the lessor DSC component instructing the lessee DSC via the DPC to restrict further handovers to the lessor network identifying attached wireless devices for which handovers should be restricted determining the CSG ids of the identified wireless devices instructing the lessee DSC to disable roaming for the determined CSG ids determining whether there is a suitable uncongested target eNodeB initiate an S1 based handover for the devices to the target eNodeB in response to identifying a suitable target eNodeB and instruct the eNodeB to initiate a QoS degradation procedure for wireless devices in the lessee network in response to determining that all the potential target eNodeBs in that same network are currently congested i.e. that there are no non congested target eNodeBs in the same network as the eNodeB . In an embodiment instructing the eNodeB or DSC to initiate QoS degradation procedure may cause that eNodeB or DSC to communicate with a policy and charging rules function PCRF component to degrade the level of QoS offered provided to the identified wireless devices.

The DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a normal to critical operation set in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Normal congestion state to a Critical congestion state. The normal to critical operation set may include operations suitable for causing the lessor DSC to instruct a lessee DSC e.g. via the DPC to restrict further handovers to the lessor network identify wireless device for which handovers should be restricted determine CSG ids of the identified wireless devices and determine whether there is a suitable e.g. uncongested in a Normal congestion state etc. target eNodeB in the lessor network. These operations may further include the lessor DSC initiating a S1 based handover procedure to handover wireless devices to a target eNodeB determined to be suitable i.e. in the same network and not congested . On the other hand the lessor DSC may instruct the eNodeB to initiate QoS degradation for all the wireless devices of the lessee network that are using attached to the eNodeB and or determine whether there are any non congested eNodeBs in the vicinity of the lessor s network in response to determining that all the potential target eNodeBs in the network are congested i.e. that there are no suitable target eNodeBs in the same network PLMN . The lessor DSC may also instruct a home subscriber server HSS to perform a detach procedure when the S1 based handover operation fail or in response to determining that there are no suitable e.g. uncongested target eNodeBs in the lessor network and not suitable target eNodeBs in the vicinity of the lessor network.

In an embodiment the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a minor to normal operation set in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Minor congestion state to a Normal congestion state.

In an embodiment the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a minor to major operation set in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Minor congestion state to a Major congestion state. These operations may include determining whether there is a non congested target eNodeB within the same network as the eNodeB initiating a S1 based handover for a mobile device to the target eNodeB when it is determined that there is a non congested target eNodeB within the same network instructing the eNodeB or DSC to initiate QoS degradation for lessee wireless device devices by triggering a PCRF to degrade the QoS when it is determined that there is no non congested target eNodeB in the same network i.e. same PLMN .

In an embodiment the DPC and or DSC components may be configured to perform a minor to critical operation set in response to determining that the eNodeB transitioned from a Minor congestion state to a Critical congestion state.

In operation block the DPC may detect an error condition. In operation the DPC may generate and send an ERROR INDICATION message to the DSC . The DPC may be configured to generate the ERROR INDICATION message to include a cause information element IE that identifies a cause for the error. In operation block the DSC and or DPC may perform various error response operations based on the information included in the received ERROR INDICATION message.

As mentioned above the DSC and DPC may be configured perform various error response or failure response operations in response to detecting an error or failure condition. As part of these operations the DSC and or DPC may identify the type or cause of the error failure condition and tailor their responses based on the identified type or cause. For example the DSC and or DPC may be configured to determine whether a detected error is a protocol error and tailor their responses accordingly.

Protocol errors include transfer syntax errors abstract syntax errors and logical errors. A transfer syntax error may occur when the receiving functional DSAAP entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. is not able to decode the received physical message. For example transfer syntax errors may be detected while decoding ASN.1 information in a received message. In an embodiment the DSC and DPC components may be configured to retransmit or re request a DSAAP message in response to determining that a detected error is a transfer syntax error e.g. as part of the error response operations .

An abstract syntax error may occur when the receiving functional DSAAP entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. receives information elements IEs or IE groups that cannot be comprehended or understood i.e. an unknown IE id . An abstract syntax error may also occur when the entity receives an information element IE for which a logical range e.g. allowed number of copies is violated. The DSC and DPC components may be configured to detect or identify these types of abstract syntax errors i.e. cannot comprehend abstract syntax error and in response perform error response operations based on criticality information included in the corresponding DSAAP message. Additional details regarding these operations and the criticality information are provided further below.

An abstract syntax error may also occur when the receiving functional DSAAP entity does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence of the object the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the received message. The DSC and DPC components may be configured to detect or identify these particular types of abstract syntax errors i.e. missing IE or IE group and in response perform error response operations based on criticality information and presence information for the missing IE IE group. Additional details regarding these operations criticality information and presence information are provided further below.

An abstract syntax error may also occur when the receiving entity receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group. In addition an abstract syntax error may also occur when the receiving entity receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the concerning object and the specified condition the IEs or IE groups should not have been present in the received message. The DSC and DPC components may be configured to detect or identify such abstract syntax errors i.e. wrong order too many occurrences erroneously present etc. and in response reject or terminate a procedure or method associated with the error e.g. the method that caused the error . The DSC and DPC components may reject or terminate the procedure method as part of the error response operations.

In the various embodiments the DSC and DPC components may be configured to continue to decode read or process a DSAAP message after detecting identifying or determining that an abstract syntax error occurred for that message. For example the DSC and DPC components may skip a portion of the message that includes an error and continue processing the other portions of the message. As part of this continued processing the DSC and DPC components may detect or identify additional abstract syntax errors.

In an embodiment the DSC and DPC components may be configured to perform error response operations for each detected abstract syntax error and or based on the criticality information and presence information for the IE IE group associated with the abstract syntax error.

As mentioned above each DSAAP message may include or may be associated with criticality information presence information range information and assigned criticality information. In the various embodiments a receiving functional DSAAP entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to use any or all of such information e.g. criticality information presence information etc. when detecting an error identifying the type of the error or the specific error response that are to be performed. That is the entity may perform different operations depending on the values of the criticality information presence information range information and or assigned criticality information.

In an embodiment the receiving functional DSAAP entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to use the presence information included in a DSAAP message when identifying the type of error and the specific error response operations that are to be performed for the identified error type. For example the entity may use the presence information to determine whether the presence of an information element IE is optional conditional or mandatory e.g. with respect to RNS application for that message or communication. The entity may determine that an abstract syntax error has occurred when a received message is missing one or more information elements that are determined to be mandatory or conditional when the condition is true .

In an embodiment the receiving functional DSAAP entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured use the criticality information when identifying the specific error response operations that are to be performed. That is each DSAAP message may include criticality information for each individual information element IE or IE group included in that message. The values of criticality information for each IE or IE group may include Reject IE Ignore IE and Notify Sender and Ignore IE. The receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may use this criticality information to determine that an IE an IE group or an EP is incomprehensible identify the condition as an abstract syntax error i.e. a cannot comprehend abstract syntax error and or to identify the error response operations that are to be performed e.g. reject ignore notify etc. .

In an embodiment the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to reject a method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method discussed above with reference to in response to determining that an information element IE included in a message received during the performance of that method procedure is incomprehensible and that value of the criticality information for that IE is set to Reject IE. 

For example when a message that initiates a method procedure e.g. a DSC REGISTER REQUEST message etc. is received determined to include one or more IEs IE groups that are incomprehensible and marked as Reject IE the receiving entity may the reject the method procedure by not executing any of the functional requests included in that message. The receiving entity may also report the rejection of one or more IEs IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. When the information in the received initiating message is insufficient and cannot be used to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure the receiving entity may terminate the procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As a further example when a message initiating a method procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received and that message includes one or more IEs IE groups marked with Reject IE which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As yet another example when a response message e.g. a DSC REGISTER RESPONSE message etc. is received that includes one or more IEs marked with Reject IE which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may consider the method procedure as being unsuccessfully terminated and initiate a local error handling method.

In an embodiment the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to ignore or skip a method procedure and initiate an DSAAP error indication method discussed above with reference to in response to determining that an information element IE included in a message received during the performance of that method procedure is incomprehensible and that value of the criticality information for that IE is set to Ignore IE and Notify Sender. 

As an example when a message initiating a method procedure is received containing one or more IEs IE groups marked with Ignore IE and Notify Sender which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may ignore the content of the incomprehensible IEs IE groups continue with the method procedure as if the incomprehensible IEs IE groups were not received except for the reporting using the comprehended IEs IE groups and report in the response message of the method procedure that one or more IEs IE groups have been ignored. When the information received in the initiating message is insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As a further example when a message initiating a method procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the method procedure is received containing one or more IEs IE groups marked with Ignore IE and Notify Sender which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs IE groups continue with the method procedure as if the not comprehended IEs IE groups were not received except for the reporting using the understood IEs IE groups and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure to report that one or more IEs IE groups have been ignored.

As yet another example when a response message is received containing one or more IEs IE groups marked with Ignore IE and Notify Sender which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may ignore the content of the not comprehended IE IE groups continue with the method procedure as if the not comprehended IEs IE groups were not received except for the reporting using the understood IEs IE groups and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

In an embodiment the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to ignore or skip a method procedure in response to determining that an information element IE included in a message received during the performance of that method procedure is incomprehensible and that value of the criticality information for that IE is set to Ignore IE. 

As an example when a message initiating a method procedure is received containing one or more IEs IE groups marked with Ignore IE which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs IE groups and continue with the method procedure as if the not comprehended IEs IE groups were not received using only the understood IEs IE groups.

As a further example when a response message is received that includes one or more IEs IE groups marked with Ignore IE which the receiving entity does not comprehend the receiving entity may ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs IE groups and continue with the method procedure as if the not comprehended IEs IE groups were not received using the understood IEs IE groups.

When reporting not comprehended IEs IE groups marked with Reject IE or Ignore IE and Notify Sender using a response message defined for the method procedure the Information Element Criticality Diagnostics IE may be included in the Criticality Diagnostics IE for each reported IE IE group.

In an embodiment the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to initiate a DSAAP error indication method discussed above with reference to in response to determining that it cannot decode a type of message IE in a received message. In an embodiment the entity may be configured to only consider the IEs specified in the specification version used by the component when determining the correct order for the IE included in a message.

In an embodiment the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to treat the missing IE IE group according to the criticality information for the missing IE IE group in the received message specified in the version of the present document used by the receiver.

As an example the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to not execute any of the functional requests of a received initiating message in response to determining that the received message is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Reject IE. The receiving entity may reject the method procedure and report the missing IEs IE groups using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the method procedure. When it is determined that the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the method procedure the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As a further example when a received message initiating a method procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Reject IE the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As yet another example when a received response message is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Reject IE the receiving entity may consider the method procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate a local error handling method procedure.

As another example when a received message initiating a method procedure is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Ignore IE and Notify Sender the receiving entity may ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the method procedure based on the other IEs IE groups present in the message and report in the response message of the method procedure that one or more IEs IE groups were missing. When the information received in the initiating message is insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As another example when a received message initiating a method procedure that does not have a message to report the outcome of the method procedure is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Ignore IE and Notify Sender the receiving entity may ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the method procedure based on the other IEs IE groups present in the message and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure to report that one or more IEs IE groups were missing.

As another example when a received message a received response message is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Ignore IE and Notify Sender the receiving entity may ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the method procedure based on the other IEs IE groups present in the message and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure to report that one or more IEs IE groups were missing.

As another example when a received message initiating a method procedure is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Ignore IE the receiving entity may ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the method procedure based on the other IEs IE groups present in the message.

As another example when a received response message is missing one or more IEs IE groups with specified criticality Ignore IE the receiving entity may ignore that those IEs IE groups are missing and continue with the method procedure based on the other IEs IE groups present in the message.

The receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to respond to messages that include IEs or IE groups that received in wrong order include too many occurrences or are erroneously present i.e. are included and marked as conditional when the condition is not met in various ways. For example the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to not execute any of the functional requests of a received initiating message in response to determining that the received message includes IEs or IE groups in wrong order includes too many occurrences of an IE or includes erroneously present IEs. The receiving entity may reject the method procedure and report the cause value Abstract Syntax Error Falsely Constructed Message using the message normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the method procedure. When the information received in the initiating message is insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the method procedure the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure.

As another example when a message initiating a method procedure that does not have a message to report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present the receiving entity may terminate the method procedure and initiate a DSAAP error indication method procedure using the cause value Abstract Syntax Error Falsely Constructed Message .

As another example when a response message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present the receiving entity may consider the method procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.

As mentioned above protocol errors include transfer syntax errors abstract syntax errors and logical errors. A logical error occurs when a message is comprehended correctly but the information contained within the message is not valid i.e. semantic error or describes a method procedure which is not compatible with the state of the receiving entity.

In an embodiment a receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to perform error response operations based on the class of the method procedure and irrespective of the criticality information of the IE s IE groups containing the erroneous values in response to determining detecting an logical error.

For example when a logical error is detected in a request message of a class 1 method procedure and the method procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome this message may be sent with an appropriate cause value i.e. in the clause IE such as semantic error or message not compatible with receiver state. When a logical error is detected in a request message of a class 1 method procedure and the method procedure does not have a message to report this unsuccessful outcome the method procedure may be terminated and a DSAAP error indication method procedure may be initiated with an appropriate cause value. Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure the procedure may be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling may be initiated.

When a logical error is detected in a message of a class 2 procedure the procedure may be terminated and a DSAAP error indication procedure may be initiated with an appropriate cause value.

In the various embodiments the receiving entity e.g. DSC DPC etc. may be configured to perform a local error handling method procedure as opposed to a DSAAP error indication method procedure when a protocol error is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message. In case a response message or error indication message needs to be returned but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that message is missing the procedure may be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error handling may be initiated. When an error that terminates a procedure occurs the returned cause value may reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality ignore and notify have earlier occurred within the same procedure.

In operation the wireless device may attach to the lessee network. In operation the first eNodeB may monitor and report resource usages and node level congestion levels to the first DSC .

In operation the first SGW may stop the resource update acknowledgment timer in response to receiving the acknowledgment message and or in response to determining that the resource update acknowledgment message was received prior the expiration of the resource update acknowledgment timer.

In operations the first eNodeB may periodically report usage congestion levels and the first DSC and first SGW may update their resource usage records which may be accomplished by performing the same or similar operations as those performed in operations . Similarly in operations the second eNodeB second DSC and second SGW may perform the same or similar operations as those performed as part of operations .

In operations and the first DSC may determine whether there are excess resources available in the first network for allocation to other networks and send a resource availability message to the DPC . The resource availability message may include information suitable for informing the DPC of the resources determined to be available for allocation. The DPC may be configured to receive store or maintain resource availability information for multiple DSCs and or for multiple different networks i.e. different PLMN IDs .

In operation the first DSC may start a timer. In operations and the first DSC may initiate or participate in an auction by monitoring its available remaining resources and sending resource availability advertisements to DPC . In operation the first DSC may determine that the timer expired and discontinue advertizing its resources. In operations the second DSC may perform the same or similar operations as those performed as part of operations .

In operation a DPC component may establish a communication link to a DSC in first communication network. In operation the DPC may determine whether a telecommunication resource of the first communication network is available for allocation based on information received via the communication link. In an embodiment the DPC may determine that the telecommunication resource is available for allocation at a future date and time.

In operation the DPC may broadcast a communication signal that includes information suitable for informing a plurality of communication networks that the telecommunication resource is available for allocation via an auction and including an auction start time for the auction. In operation the DPC may receive bids from the plurality of communication networks for the telecommunication resource determined to be available for allocation in response to broadcasting the communication message and after the auction start time included in the broadcast communication signal. In an embodiment receiving bids from the plurality of communication networks may include receiving bids for access and use of the telecommunication resource determined at the future date and time.
