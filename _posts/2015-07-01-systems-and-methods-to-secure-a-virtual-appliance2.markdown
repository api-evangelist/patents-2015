This present application is continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 912 599 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS TO SECURE A VIRTUAL APPLIANCE filed Oct. 26 2010 now allowed which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 255 059 entitled Systems and Methods to Secure a Virtual Appliance filed Oct. 26 2009 which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for any and all purposes.

The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for securing a virtual appliance and in some embodiments within a deployment of App Receiver and Merchandising Server.

When shipping a virtual appliance VA the underlying operating system may not be exposed to the customer and as such the VA is normally locked down from external access. This makes it challenging to allow support staff to access the underlying operating system to provide support and maintenance.

The present disclosure and the solution described herein is directed towards providing a flexible and secure virtual appliance that may be supported by support staff without reliance on a fixed password. When shipping a virtual appliance VA it may not be desirable to expose the underlying Operating System to the customer or other persons. Such VA may be normally locked down from any external access except for accesses via ports for communication with the VA.

In some aspects the virtual appliance may be locked down for external access except the following ports 

1. Port 443 for HTTPS accesses. Port 443 may be considered the normal mode of access though which the VA application is exposed to the customer.

2. Port 22 for SSH access. Port 22 may be left enabled in case the vendor support department does require access to the underlying operating system in order to perform maintenance or troubleshooting on the VA. In some embodiments the system software updates are not assumed to be included in such maintenance they should be handled as part of the VA application. In the event that the appliance was Windows OS based an equivalent might be the RDP port or ICA port.

Since a VA is usually created from a shipped image file for example a XVA 1 OVA file all deployed VAs may have the same password for the built in root administrator account. The password can be a secret maintained by the vendor but it may be leaked over time yielding a direct route into the VA. With full access to the underlying operating system of the VA a hacker could subvert the built in security mechanisms of the application putting users of that application and the vendors reputation at risk. The invention seeks to prevent the reliance on a fixed password yet still enable vendor support staff to access the underlying operating system via SSH or similar should maintenance operations be required.

In summary of some embodiments the VA would ship with no root password enabled and the remote access SSH port disabled. If maintenance is required the customer triggers a support event which creates a password and enables the remote access port.

The password is sent to the vendors site where a support agent can access it and connect to the VA. Once maintenance is complete the password is reset and the port closed. Some of the advantages over the fixed password method are that it prevents the leakage of what has to be a reasonably communicated piece of information creating a vulnerability in all deployed VAs. Having the customer interaction and access via an audited tool also enhances the security process.

In one aspect the present disclosure relates to a method for providing secure support to a virtual appliance. A virtual appliance VA may be established on a first device. The VA may comprise a self contained virtual machine with a pre installed operating system. The virtual appliance may be established with no root password enabled and a remote access port disabled. An administration tool may request from a requestor a request to enable maintenance for the virtual appliance. The administration tool may generate responsive to the request a random password. The administration tool may enable responsive to the request the remote access port. The virtual appliance may wait for a connection to the remote access port for a predetermined period of time. The administration tool may transmit the random password to a service of a second device. The second device may be remote to the first device.

In some embodiments the administration tool displays an access code to retrieve the random password. In further embodiments a support agent retrieves via a second administration tool of the second device the random password using the access code. In some embodiments the support agent connects via a network to the remote access port of the virtual machine using the random password. In certain embodiments the remote access port is disabled and the administrative password is reset upon receiving a logoff request via the remote access port. In some embodiments the first device receives the virtual appliance with no root password enabled and the remote access port disabled. In certain embodiments the requestor submits the request via an enable maintenance user interface of the administration tool. In further embodiments the administration tool generates responsive to the request a new random password per each request. In some embodiments the administration tool enables the remote access port until a connection is established within the predetermined time period. In further embodiments the virtual appliance disables the remote access port if a connection is not received within the predetermined time period. In some embodiments the administration tool transmits the random password to a web service executing on the second device.

In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core 1 may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core 2 performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core 3 may perform SSL offloading while core 4 may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core 1 A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core 1 A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core 2 B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core 4 D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core 2 B may handle SSL offloading while Core 4 D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core 1 A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core 1 A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core 1 A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core 1 A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core 1 A because the load A on Core 1 is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core 1 A the amount of load A on Core 1 A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core 4 D because Core 4 D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

Each core A N in one embodiment can be associated with a particular packet engine such that load balancing can be carried out by the packet engine. Load balancing may in this embodiment require that each packet engine A N associated with a core communicate with the other packet engines associated with cores so that the packet engines A N can collectively determine where to distribute load. One embodiment of this process can include an arbiter that receives votes from each packet engine for load. The arbiter can distribute load to each packet engine A N based in part on the age of the engine s vote and in some cases a priority value associated with the current amount of load on an engine s associated core .

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

In other embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of an appliance or a single device the functionality may be deployed across multiple devices in any arrangement. For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

The hardware of the appliance such as a NIC or the kernel may be designed and constructed to support sequential operations across the NICs and or cores.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In some embodiments the RSS module uses the MICROSOFT receive side scaling RSS scheme. In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The RSS module can apply any type and form hash function such as the Toeplitz hash function. The hash function may be applied to the hash type or any the sequence of values. The hash function may be a secure hash of any security level or is otherwise cryptographically secure. The hash function may use a hash key. The size of the key is dependent upon the hash function. For the Toeplitz hash the size may be 40 bytes for IPv6 and 16 bytes for IPv4.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask.

The flow distributor in some embodiments executes within any module or program on the appliance on any one of the cores and on any one of the devices or components included within the multi core system . In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system . In such an embodiment the flow distributor can communicate with the multi core system to take in data packets and distribute the packets across the one or more cores .

Illustrated in is an embodiment of a multi core system comprising one or more processing cores A N. In brief overview one of the cores can be designated as a control core A and can be used as a control plane for the other cores . The other cores may be secondary cores which operate in a data plane while the control core provides the control plane. The cores A N may share a global cache . While the control core provides a control plane the other cores in the multi core system form or provide a data plane. These cores perform data processing functionality on network traffic while the control provides initialization configuration and control of the multi core system.

Further referring to and in more detail the cores A N as well as the control core A can be any processor described herein. Furthermore the cores A N and the control core A can be any processor able to function within the system described in . Still further the cores A N and the control core A can be any core or group of cores described herein. The control core may be a different type of core or processor than the other cores. In some embodiments the control may operate a different packet engine or have a packet engine configured differently than the packet engines of the other cores.

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache. For example 50 of each memory of each code may be dedicated or allocated to the shared global cache. That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core 1 may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the in 1 memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core 1 A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system.

VA A may be installed or established without a root password or having the root password disabled. VA A may also have one or more remote access ports disabled. In some embodiments remote access port on device A which may normally be used for service or maintenance of VA A may be disabled. The disabled access port may normally be enabled for other configurations of VA A. VA A may be installed on a device A located on a customer site. VA A may malfunction or require support update fix or maintenance by a customer support agent.

At step the customer or the user of VA A on device A requests to enable the maintenance or service o for VA A. In some embodiments the customer or the user of device A sends the request via a user interface. The requestor may submit the request via an enable maintenance user interface of the administration tool . The request may trigger a procedure for enabling maintenance by a remote technical support center or a support agent providing support from a remote device N. In some embodiments the request for maintenance or support is internal to VA A. In other embodiments the request is forwarded to device N or server .

At step in response to the request a random password is generated and a remote access port is enabled for communication. In some embodiments password generator generates the random password. In some embodiments the administration tool generates the random password. The random password may be root password for providing administrator level access to VA A. The random password may be kept confidential and not be provided to the customer or the user of VA A or device A. A different random password may be generated for each subsequent request for maintenance. The customer or the requestor of the service or maintenance may receive an access code A. The access code A may be different from the random password. The access code may be displayed by the administration tool . In some embodiments access code A corresponds to the random password or includes a portion of the random password. In further embodiments access code A may be used along with a function or an encryption key to generate the random password such as the root password . The random password may be transmitted to device N or server A via a secure connection. VA A may enable the remote access port to receive a connection from device N to perform the service or maintenance. In some embodiments the administration tool enables the remote access port . In some embodiments VA A enables the remote access port that is normally used for transport layer connections or secure connections with VA or device A.

At step the virtual appliance A waits for connection via the enabled remote access port . VA may wait for the connection for a predetermined period of time. In order to minimize the risk of unwanted access and maintain the security of device A the generated random password may be set to expire after the predetermined amount of time. Similarly the enabled remote access port may be set to be disabled if a connection for providing service or maintenance is not made within the predetermined amount of time. The predetermined period of time may be any amount of time between one second and one year such as for example a second 30 seconds 1 minute 5 minutes 15 minutes 30 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 5 hours 8 hours 12 hours 1 day 2 days 4 days 7 days a month 2 months 6 months or a year. The predetermined amount of time for the expiration of the random password and the predetermined amount of time for disabling the enabled remote access port may be same or different. In some embodiments the random password and the remote access port may expire or be disabled at the same time. VA A may count the time using a timer and wait for the connection for providing service and maintenance to be made via the remote access port .

At step the virtual appliance A transmits the generated random password to a remote device. The random password may be transmitted to any secure device such as device N on the technical support center site or the server on the enterprise site. The random password may be transmitted by VA A to device N automatically after being generated. The administration tool at device A may transmit the random password to a web service executing on another device such as device N or server A. The random password may be transmitted via a secure connection. The random password may be transmitted without enabling the customer requesting the service or maintenance to see the password. The random password may be encrypted using a key and then transmitted.

At step a support agent at device N retrieves the random password using the access code A. The retrieved random password may be password N stored on device N or server A. The random password may be retrieved by the support agent using the administration tool at device N. The support agent may receive the access code A from the customer who was given the access code A upon the generated request for the service or maintenance. In order to maintain the security of VA A the access code A may be transmitted to device N separately and independently from the transmission of the random password such as the root password . The customer may provide the support agent with the access code A via a telephone email or a secure transmission. The support agent may use the access code A to retrieve the random password from device N or from the server A. As the random password may be stored anywhere on device N or server A the support agent may not be able to locate the random password without the access code A. In some embodiments the random password is recreated or regenerated by running a function using the access code A. For example the random password may be generated by encrypting or decrypting the access code A at the device N.

At step the support agent may connect from the device N to VA A via the enabled remote access port . The support agent may make the connection with VA A prior to the expiration of the predetermined time period. The connection may be made using the random password retrieved by the support agent at step . The support agent may provide maintenance and support to VA A via the connection established over the enabled remote access port . The support agent may gain administrator level access to VA A using the random password and or access code A. In some embodiments if the connection is established prior to the expiration of the predetermined time period the connection is not terminated once the connection is made until the maintenance or the service is completed.

At step once the support agent logs off from the virtual appliance A the random password and the remote access port are disabled. In some embodiments once the maintenance is completed and the connection with the remote access port is terminated the remote access port is disabled for any further connections. In further embodiments the random password is made invalid once the maintenance is complete. In some embodiments the root password is set to not enabled. In some embodiments the remote access port is disabled. The VA A may proceed to disable the remote access port and reset the administrative password upon receiving a logoff request via the remote access port.
