This disclosure relates to selecting telecommunications channels. More particularly this disclosure relates to selecting a telecommunications channel based on the individual recipient and external factors.

Modern marketers want the ability to deliver personalized messages to their customers. They also desire the ability to select the optimal telecommunication channel s on which to deliver such marketing messages. Many marketing products allow a provider to determine the Next Best Offer e.g. a discount promotion advertisement etc. for a consumer using a variety of intelligent heuristics. However those marketing products do not provide the ability to determine the best outbound telecommunications channel s on which the marketing message should be served. As more and more channels become commonplace and as new marketing telecommunications channels are added every year determining the best telecommunications channel on which to serve offer content is becoming increasingly important.

An approach is provided for selecting a telecommunications channel. In the approach recipient attributes that correspond to an intended recipient are identified and current environment settings are retrieved. Predefined channel expression rules are then executed with the channel expression rules utilizing the recipient attributes and the current environment settings as inputs to the rules. The execution of the channel expression rules results in the identification of a best telecommunications channel. A message is then transmitted to the intended recipient over the identified best telecommunications channel.

The approach described herein provides the ability to determine the best telecommunications channel for a given marketing message on an individual recipient basis. In today s modern digital world a customer can be contacted via TV billboards direct marketing phone text message email mobile applications web adds and more. While some people may view offers sent to them equally on any of these telecommunications channels many people tune out marketing messages on some of these channels. This is often a personal preference making the determination of the Best Channel for a given individual a non trivial task. This approach allows the usage of algorithms to assist in the process of selecting the best channel s on which to deliver a given offer to an individual recipient. Marketers are able to use any of a recipient s known attributes as well as attributes of the offer itself to create an advanced expression condition to govern whether a channel is best for delivering a given offer to a specific recipient and to do so in near real time.

For example suppose that Company A is about to send an offer to one of its customers customer A 1 . Before the offer is sent the system consults a set of predefined channel expression rules e.g. defined by company A s marketing department consultants etc. that determine the channel that best serves the offer to customer A 1. In defining the rules the marketer can compare any of customer A 1 s attributes to any other attribute or value. In addition the rules can also compare customer attributes to attributes of the offer. A variety of functions and transformations can also be used in this rule definition. A trivial example might be as simple as just checking whether the system has the person s phone number before selecting SMS as the telecommunications channel. A slightly more advanced condition might be to recognize that it s very late at night for that person and the customer might be annoyed to receive a text message at 2 AM so sending it on email is likely a better option. An extension to the rule might be to add a further condition that says it s acceptable to send a text message at 2 AM if the customer just performed an action on the company s website. Further predefined channel expression rules are shown and described herein.

Events are received by a processing system using event APIs Application Programming Interfaces . Each API provides a set of routines protocols and tools for handling the various types of events. Process receives event inputs from the event APIs and performs realtime event processing and segmentation on the events. Process receives results from the realtime event processing and segmentation process and performs advanced event detection and pattern detection. For example multiple events may be combined by process using advanced heuristics. For example a trigger may be received that a customer is in a particular area of a store as well as a website trigger from the merchant s website that the customer is searching for a particular product.

Based on the processing performed by processes and an offer or other marketing message may be retrieved by process that implement various offer strategies utilized by the merchant in communications with customers. If an offer was retrieved process performs the channel selector process that selects the best telecommunications channel to use with this particular customer in order to communicate the retrieved offer. In one embodiment offer dispatcher is used to dispatch the retrieved offer to the customer over the selected best telecommunications channel.

If a custom gateway is being used to communicate the offer then offer dispatcher transmits the offer to custom gateway for transmission to the customer over the selected best the telecommunications channel. Custom gateway then transmits the offer to the customer over a third party channel . If a custom gateway is not being used to communicate the offer then offer dispatcher transmits the offer to using outbound gateways e.g. email SMS website landing page mobile push etc. . Message such as a marketing message or other message with an offer from the merchant is transmitted to customer device over the selected best telecommunications channel.

At step the user profile attributes and conditions are selected for the selected channel expression. The user profile attributes and conditions are selected from available user attributes data store and the selected user profile attributes are stored in expression attributes and conditions memory area .

At step offer attributes and conditions for the selected channel expression are selected from available offer attributes data store . The selected offer attributes and conditions are stored in expression attributes and conditions memory area .

At step any additional functions and extensions and their associated attributes and conditions are selected for the selected channel expression are selected from other available functions extensions and attributes data store . The selected other available functions extensions and attributes data are stored in expression attributes and conditions memory area .

At step the conditions between session profile offer and additional attributes are retrieved from memory area and edited as needed. The channel expression is stored in configured telecommunications channel expressions. The process determines as to whether more channel expressions are being setup decision .

The following channel expression examples are provided to illustrate the flexibility of channel expressions. In the first example a channel expression is formed to select SMS as the channel for a 20 Off coupon for this recipient IF it s normal business hours in their time zone OR if a detection was made that the customer just struggled using the merchant s website when entering a promotion code three times in the last five minutes and the user has more than three abandoned shopping carts in the last year 

In the second example a channel expression is formed to select the mobile push notification as the channel for a 40 Off coupon for this recipient IF the customer is known to make more than 100 000 per year and the customer just installed and logged into our mobile app for the first time after receiving and opened the Install our new mobile app email we sent last month 

In the third example a channel expression is formed to select the mobile push notification as the channel for delivering this offer ie promotion for this recipient IF they make more than the offer s income threshold and just installed and logged into our mobile app for the first time and did so after receiving and opening the Install our new mobile app email we sent last month.

In the fourth example a channel expression is formed to select email as the channel for delivering this offer ie promotion to this recipient IF within 5 minutes of leaving a store the recipient makes a large purchase through the mobile app where a large purchase is defined as a being more than 3 times the standard deviation of their past year s purchase history AND this offer s message body is too large to fit in one text message and EITHER the recipient s phone is an older model which displays large messages badly OR the recipient lives in a country where text messaging is expensive.

If more channel expressions are being setup then decision branches to the yes branch which loops back to setup the next channel expression as described above. This looping continues until there are no more channel expressions to be setup at which point decision branches to the no branch. In one embodiment at step the process orders or sorts the configured channel expressions from most the preferred channel to the least preferred channel. In this manner if the attributes collected when a trigger occurs matches more than one channel expression the first or most preferred channel expression will be selected and utilized. The sorted channel expressions are stored in ordered channel expressions data store . Channel selector configuration processing thereafter ends at .

At step the process attempts to identify the customer corresponding to the triggered event using such tools and technologies as biometric data e.g. camera images of the customer etc. the customer s user identifier if using the store s website anonymous identifiers such as cookies mobile device identifiers and the like. Customer data is retrieved from data store . When a match is found the matching customer data e.g. customer profile data customer identifier s customer channel contact identifiers etc. are retrieved and stored in memory area .

The process determines as to whether identification of the customer corresponding to the event was successful decision . If identification of the customer corresponding to the event was successful then decision branches to the yes branch to process any offers that the merchant may desire to present to the identified customer. On the other hand if identification of the customer corresponding to the event was unsuccessful then decision branches to the no branch bypassing the remaining steps and looping back to step to receive the next customer event. Based on the type of telecommunications channel being used by the channel expression personal identifiable information PII may or may not be needed. For example if the channel expression provides an offer to the customer by sending a text message to the user s mobile telephone then the user s identity would be needed to lookup the mobile telephone number that corresponds to the customer. On the other hand if the channel expression provides an offer to a customer on the merchant s website then the customer s PII is not needed and the anonymous address e.g. IP address etc. corresponding to the customer when accessing the merchant s website can be used to transmit the offer to the customer.

At step the process adds the detected event to a list of activities identified for this customer. The process stores the activities pertaining to a customer in memory area . Customer activities are collected and added to memory area because a combination of events may initiate the sending of an offer to the customer rather than a single action or event.

At step the process compares the collected customer s activities to the configured offer rules. The customer s collected activities are retrieved from memory area and the configured offer rules are retrieved from offer rules data store . Offer s identified for the customer based on the customer s activities are stored in memory area .

The process determines as to whether the comparison performed at step identified any offers for this customer based on the customer s activities decision . If any offers have been identified for this customer then decision branches to the yes branch for further processing. On the other hand if no offers were identified for this customer then decision branches to the no branch bypassing the remaining steps and looping back to step to receive the next customer event.

At predefined process the process performs the Select Delivery Channel routine see and corresponding text for processing details . The Select Delivery Channel identifies the best telecommunications channel to use to send this customer the offer by utilizing the channel expressions retrieved from data store the customer data retrieved from memory area and the identified offer s retrieved from memory area . When the conditions set forth in a channel expression are satisfied then the telecommunications channel e.g. text message email message to website user etc. set forth in the channel expression is used to transmit the message such as an offer to the customer. At step the process delivers the offer to customer device over the telecommunications channel that was selected by predefined process .

At step the process gathers current environment data such as the current date time day of week and the like. Step stores the gathered environment data in memory area . At step the process selects the first channel expression. The channel expressions are retrieved from ordered channel expressions data store . The selected channel expression is stored in memory area .

The process determines as to whether the process is able to send a message to this customer using the channel in the channel expression decision . For example if the first channel expression uses SMS to send a text message to the customer but the customer data does not include the customer s SMS contact data e.g. mobile phone number etc. then a different channel e.g. email etc. is needed. If the process is able to communicate with this customer using the channel included in the selected channel expression then decision branches to the yes branch for further processing. On the other hand if the process is not able to communicate with this customer using this channel then decision branches to the no branch which bypasses steps through .

At step the process executes selected channel expression using inputs of customer data customer activities data for identified offers and current environment data. Step retrieves the environment data from memory area the customer data from memory area the customer s activities from memory area the offer from memory area and the selected channel expression from memory area . The result from executing the channel expression using the various inputs is stored in memory area . In one embodiment the expression result is a Boolean value e.g. 1 TRUE or 0 FALSE etc. that indicates whether the channel expression corresponds to a channel that can be used given the various inputs. Because the channel expressions in data store are sorted in preferred order the first channel expression that can be used results in a 1 or TRUE value is the channel expression and telecommunications channel that is selected.

Based on the result of executing the channel expression the process determines as to whether to use this channel decision . If the channel result indicated that this channel is the best telecommunications channel to use with this customer then decision branches to the yes branch whereupon processing returns to the calling routine see at . On the other hand the result of executing the channel expression indicated that this channel should not be selected then decision branches to the no branch and processing continues.

The process determines as to whether there are more channel expressions available for execution decision . If there are more channel expressions available for execution then decision branches to the yes branch which loops back to step to select and execute the next channel expression as described above. This looping continues until either a suitable channel expression is found with decision branching to yes branch or there are no more channel expressions to execute at which point decision branches to the no branch exiting the loop and processing returns to the calling routine see at with a return code indicating that a suitable channel was not identified for this customer.
