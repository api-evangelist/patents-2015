At least one program may include an instruction that enables the electronic device to execute methods according to an embodiment of the present invention described in claims and or a specification of the present invention. When the instruction is executed by at least one processor e.g. the processor the at least one processor perform a function corresponding to the instruction. The non transitory computer readable storage media may be for example the memory . At least a portion of the programming module may be implemented e.g. executed by for example the processor . At least a portion of the programming module may include for example a module a program a routine a set of instructions or a process for performing at least one function.

The non transitory computer readable storage media may include magnetic media such as a hard disk a floppy disk and a magnetic tape optical media such as a Compact Disc Read Only memory CD ROM and a Digital Versatile Disc DVD magneto optical media such as a floptical disk and a hardware device an Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only memory EEPROM a magnetic disk storage device or optical storage devices of other forms and a magnetic cassette specially formed to store and perform a program instruction e.g. a programming module such as a Read Only Memory ROM a Random Access memory RAM and a flash memory. Alternatively the program may be stored at a memory formed with a combination of a portion or the entire thereof. Further each constituent memory may be included in plural.

Further the program may be stored at an attachable storage device that may access the electronic device through a communication network such as the Internet the Intranet a Local Area Network LAN a Wireless LAN WLAN a Storage Area Network SAN or a communication network formed with a combination thereof. Such a storage device may access the electronic device through an external port. Further a separate storage device on the communication network may access a portable electronic device. In order to perform an operation of an embodiment of the present invention the above described hardware device may be formed to operate as at least one software module and vice versa.

A module or a programming module according to an embodiment of the present invention may include at least one of the foregoing elements may omit some elements or may further include additional other elements. Operations performed by a module a programming module or another element according to an embodiment of the present invention may be executed with a sequential parallel repeated or heuristic method. Further some operations may be executed in different orders may be omitted or may add other operations.

While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.
