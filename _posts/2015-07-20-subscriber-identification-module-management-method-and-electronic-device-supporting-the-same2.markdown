The profile processing module supports profile reception and processing relating to communication service use of a specific communication service provider. For example if a specific communication service provider is selected the profile processing module establishes a connection with a network managed by a corresponding communication service provider and provides device unique information or SIM ID information to the communication service provider device on the basis of the network connection. If server ID information is obtained during this operation the profile processing module provides the server ID information to the communication service provider device . If server ID information is not obtained the profile processing module requests the acquisition of the server ID information from the communication service provider device while providing device unique information and SIM ID information to the communication service provider device . The communication service provider device obtains server ID information corresponding to corresponding device unique information and SIM ID information from a server device for example a SIM manufacturer server device or an electronic device manufacturer server device providing the server ID information.

The profile processing module may receive a request relating to profile reception from at least one of the communication service provider device the profile generation support device and the profile transmission support device . If a profile reception related request is received the profile processing module requests that the SIM establish a session with the profile transmission support device . In relation to this the profile processing module establishes a communication channel with the profile transmission support device on the basis of the obtained server ID information. Alternatively the profile processing module may establish a communication channel with the profile transmission support device by obtaining server ID information from the communication service provider device . The profile processing module may request that the SIM establishes a session relating to profile reception with the profile transmission support device . Once the session is established the communication service management related profile of a specific communication service provider is delivered to the SIM through the communication interface . If a specific profile installation to the SIM is completed the profile processing module requests information corresponding thereto from the information display module .
