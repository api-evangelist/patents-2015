The present Application for Patent claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62 046 816 entitled DISPATCH CONSOLE CLIENT FUNCTIONALITY filed Sep. 5 2014 assigned to the assignee hereof and expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks a third generation 3G high speed data Internet capable wireless service and a fourth generation 4G service e.g. Long Term Evolution LTE or WiMax . There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA etc.

In a full duplex communication system such as a cellular communication system all parties on a call can communicate simultaneously because there is a two way communication channel between them. In contrast in a half duplex communication system communication among the parties is permitted in only one direction at a time. That is when one party is transmitting the other parties cannot transmit but rather can only receive the transmission.

An example of half duplex communication is Push to Talk PTT where a momentary button press switches from a voice or media reception mode to a voice or media transmit mode referred to as transmitting a talk spurt . Two way radios or walkie talkies utilize half duplex communication. PTT over Cellular PoC is a communication service in a cellular network that allows subscribers to use their cell phones as PTT devices. PoC and other PTT like services such as Push to X PTX also allow participants to transmit non voice media e.g. images videos sound files location etc. in addition to voice media.

A significant advantage of PTT and PTT like services is the ability to connect multiple participants in a group communication. A single user can reach an active communication group with a single button press users need not make several calls to coordinate with a group.

These and other aspects of the disclosure are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the disclosure. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements of the disclosure will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the disclosure.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the disclosure does not require that all embodiments of the disclosure include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A client device referred to herein as a user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with a radio access network RAN . As used herein the term UE may be referred to interchangeably as an access terminal or AT a wireless device a subscriber device a subscriber terminal a subscriber station a user terminal or UT a mobile terminal a mobile station and variations thereof. Generally UEs can communicate with a core network via the RAN and through the core network the UEs can be connected with external networks such as the Internet. Of course other mechanisms of connecting to the core network and or the Internet are also possible for the UEs such as over wired access networks WiFi networks e.g. based on IEEE 802.11 etc. and so on. UEs can be embodied by any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC cards compact flash devices external or internal modems wireless or wireline phones and so on. A communication link through which UEs can send signals to the RAN is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a reverse control channel an access channel etc. . A communication link through which the RAN can send signals to UEs is called a downlink or forward link channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring to UEs . . . N are configured to communicate with an access network e.g. the RAN an access point etc. over a physical communications interface or layer shown in as air interfaces and or a direct wired connection. The air interfaces and can comply with a given cellular communications protocol e.g. CDMA EVDO eHRPD GSM EDGE W CDMA LTE etc. while the air interface can comply with a wireless IP protocol e.g. IEEE 802.11 . The RAN includes a plurality of access points that serve UEs over air interfaces such as the air interfaces and . The access points in the RAN can be referred to as access nodes or ANs access points or APs base stations or BSs Node Bs eNode Bs and so on. These access points can be terrestrial access points or ground stations or satellite access points. The RAN is configured to connect to a core network that can perform a variety of functions including bridging circuit switched CS calls between UEs served by the RAN and other UEs served by the RAN or a different RAN altogether and can also mediate an exchange of packet switched PS data with external networks such as Internet . The Internet includes a number of routing agents and processing agents not shown in for the sake of convenience . In UE N is shown as connecting to the Internet directly i.e. separate from the core network such as over an Ethernet connection of WiFi or 802.11 based network . The Internet can thereby function to bridge packet switched data communications between UE N and UEs . . . N via the core network . Also shown in is the access point that is separate from the RAN . The access point may be connected to the Internet independent of the core network e.g. via an optical communication system such as FiOS a cable modem etc. . The air interface may serve UE or UE over a local wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11 in an example. UE N is shown as a desktop computer with a wired connection to the Internet such as a direct connection to a modem or router which can correspond to the access point itself in an example e.g. for a WiFi router with both wired and wireless connectivity .

Referring to an application server is shown as connected to the Internet the core network or both. The application server can be implemented as a plurality of structurally separate servers or alternately may correspond to a single server. As will be described below in more detail the application server is configured to support one or more communication services e.g. Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP sessions Push to Talk PTT sessions group communication sessions social networking services etc. for UEs that can connect to the application server via the core network and or the Internet and or to provide content e.g. web page downloads to the UEs.

As shown in an external casing of UE A is configured with an antenna A display A at least one button A e.g. a PTT button a power button a volume control button etc. and a keypad A among other components as is known in the art. Also an external casing of UE B is configured with a touchscreen display B peripheral buttons B B B and B e.g. a power control button a volume or vibrate control button an airplane mode toggle button etc. at least one front panel button B e.g. a Home button etc. among other components as is known in the art. While not shown explicitly as part of UE B the UE B can include one or more external antennas and or one or more integrated antennas that are built into the external casing of UE B including but not limited to WiFi antennas cellular antennas satellite position system SPS antennas e.g. global positioning system GPS antennas and so on.

While internal components of UEs such as the UEs A and B can be embodied with different hardware configurations a basic high level UE configuration for internal hardware components is shown as platform in . The platform can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks e.g. application server web URLs etc. . The platform can also independently execute locally stored applications without RAN interaction. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can store applications not actively used in memory as well as other data. The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The platform may also include a control zone module which may be stored in memory and executable by ASIC or may be a hardware or firmware component coupled to or integrated into ASIC .

Accordingly an embodiment of the disclosure can include a UE e.g. UE A B etc. including the ability to perform the functions described herein such as setting a control zone configuration for members of a communication group. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API local database and or control zone module may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component such as the control zone module . Therefore the features of the UEs A and B in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The control zone module may have different functionality depending on whether it is implemented by a dispatcher device e.g. UE B or a client device of the dispatcher device e.g. UE A. For example in an aspect where the control zone module is implemented by a dispatcher device the control zone module cooperatively with the ASIC and the API may be configured to establish a geofence associated with a geographic area including one or more members of the communication group as described herein. The control zone module in conjunction with the ASIC may be further configured to determine a control zone configuration for members of the communication group within the geofence as described herein. The transceiver cooperatively with the control zone module and the ASIC may be configured to send the control zone configuration to the one or more members of the communication group as described herein.

The transceiver cooperatively with the control zone module and the ASIC may also be configured to send a location request to the one or more members of the communication group and to receive location updates from each of the one or more members of the communication group based on a location update frequency. The touchscreen display B cooperatively with the control zone module the ASIC and or the API may be configured to display locations of the one or more members of the communication group on a map representing the geofence and to update a user interface showing locations of the one or more members of the communication group within the geofence with the received location updates.

However where the control zone module is implemented by a client device of the dispatcher device such as a member of the above described communication group the transceiver and the control zone module in conjunction with the ASIC may be configured to receive control zone configuration from the dispatcher device. The control zone module in conjunction with the ASIC may be configured to cause the client device to operate in accordance with the control zone information. Additionally the transceiver and the control zone module in conjunction with the ASIC may be configured to send location updates to the dispatcher device.

The wireless communication between the UEs A and or B and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the UEs from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the disclosure and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the disclosure.

Referring to the communication device includes logic configured to receive and or transmit information . In an example if the communication device corresponds to a wireless communications device e.g. UE A or B AP a BS Node B or eNodeB in the RAN etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include a wireless communications interface e.g. Bluetooth WiFi 2G CDMA W CDMA 3G 4G LTE etc. such as a wireless transceiver and associated hardware e.g. an RF antenna a MODEM a modulator and or demodulator etc. . In another example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to a wired communications interface e.g. a serial connection a USB or Firewire connection an Ethernet connection through which the Internet can be accessed etc. . Thus if the communication device corresponds to some type of network based server e.g. application server etc. the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can correspond to an Ethernet card in an example that connects the network based server to other communication entities via an Ethernet protocol. In a further example the logic configured to receive and or transmit information can include sensory or measurement hardware by which the communication device can monitor its local environment e.g. an accelerometer a temperature sensor a light sensor an antenna for monitoring local RF signals etc. . The logic configured to receive and or transmit information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive and or transmit information to perform its reception and or transmission function s . However the logic configured to receive and or transmit information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to process information . In an example the logic configured to process information can include at least a processor. Example implementations of the type of processing that can be performed by the logic configured to process information includes but is not limited to performing determinations establishing connections making selections between different information options performing evaluations related to data interacting with sensors coupled to the communication device to perform measurement operations converting information from one format to another e.g. between different protocols such as .wmv to .avi etc. and so on. For example the processor included in the logic configured to process information can correspond to a general purpose processor a digital signal processor DSP an ASIC a field programmable gate array FPGA or other programmable logic device discrete gate or transistor logic discrete hardware components or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor but in the alternative the processor may be any conventional processor controller microcontroller or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices e.g. a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor a plurality of microprocessors one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core or any other such configuration. The logic configured to process information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to process information to perform its processing function s . However the logic configured to process information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to process information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further includes logic configured to store information . In an example the logic configured to store information can include at least a non transitory memory and associated hardware e.g. a memory controller etc. . For example the non transitory memory included in the logic configured to store information can correspond to RAM memory flash memory ROM memory EPROM memory EEPROM memory registers hard disk a removable disk a CD ROM or any other form of storage medium known in the art. The logic configured to store information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to store information to perform its storage function s . However the logic configured to store information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to store information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to present information . In an example the logic configured to present information can include at least an output device and associated hardware. For example the output device can include a video output device e.g. a display screen a port that can carry video information such as USB HDMI etc. an audio output device e.g. speakers a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack USB HDMI etc. a vibration device and or any other device by which information can be formatted for output or actually outputted by a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to present information can include the display A of UE A or the touchscreen display B of UE B. In a further example the logic configured to present information can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers such as the application server etc. . The logic configured to present information can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to present information to perform its presentation function s . However the logic configured to present information does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to present information relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Referring to the communication device further optionally includes logic configured to receive local user input . In an example the logic configured to receive local user input can include at least a user input device and associated hardware. For example the user input device can include buttons a touchscreen display a keyboard a camera an audio input device e.g. a microphone or a port that can carry audio information such as a microphone jack etc. and or any other device by which information can be received from a user or operator of the communication device . For example if the communication device corresponds to UE A or UE B as shown in the logic configured to receive local user input can include the keypad A any of the buttons A or B through B the touchscreen display B etc. In a further example the logic configured to receive local user input can be omitted for certain communication devices such as network communication devices that do not have a local user e.g. network switches or routers remote servers such as the application server etc. . The logic configured to receive local user input can also include software that when executed permits the associated hardware of the logic configured to receive local user input to perform its input reception function s . However the logic configured to receive local user input does not correspond to software alone and the logic configured to receive local user input relies at least in part upon hardware to achieve its functionality.

Where the communication device is configured to set a control zone configuration for members of a communication group the logic configured to receive local user input in conjunction with the logic configured to process information may be configured to establish a geofence associated with a geographic area including one or more members of the communication group. The logic configured to process information may further be configured to determine the control zone configuration for members of the communication group within the geofence. The logic configured to process information and the logic configured to receive and or transmit information may be configured to send the control zone configuration to the one or more members of the communication group. Similarly where the communication device is a member of the communication group and configured to receive a control zone configuration from a dispatcher device the logic configured to receive and or transmit information in conjunction with the logic configured to process information may be configured to receive the control zone configuration from the dispatcher device. The logic configured to process information may be configured to cause the communication device to operate in accordance with the control zone information. Additionally the logic configured to receive and or transmit information in conjunction with the logic configured to process information may be configured to send location updates to the dispatcher device.

Referring to while the configured logics of through are shown as separate or distinct blocks in it will be appreciated that the hardware and or software by which the respective configured logic performs its functionality can overlap in part. For example any software used to facilitate the functionality of the configured logics of through can be stored in the non transitory memory associated with the logic configured to store information such that the configured logics of through each performs their functionality i.e. in this case software execution based in part upon the operation of software stored by the logic configured to store information . Likewise hardware that is directly associated with one of the configured logics can be borrowed or used by other configured logics from time to time. For example the processor of the logic configured to process information can format data into an appropriate format before being transmitted by the logic configured to receive and or transmit information such that the logic configured to receive and or transmit information performs its functionality i.e. in this case transmission of data based in part upon the operation of hardware i.e. the processor associated with the logic configured to process information .

Generally unless stated otherwise explicitly the phrase logic configured to as used throughout this disclosure is intended to invoke an embodiment that is at least partially implemented with hardware and is not intended to map to software only implementations that are independent of hardware. Also it will be appreciated that the configured logic or logic configured to in the various blocks are not limited to specific logic gates or elements but generally refer to the ability to perform the functionality described herein either via hardware or a combination of hardware and software . Thus the configured logics or logic configured to as illustrated in the various blocks are not necessarily implemented as logic gates or logic elements despite sharing the word logic. Other interactions or cooperation between the logic in the various blocks will become clear to one of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the embodiments described below in more detail.

The various embodiments may be implemented on any of a variety of commercially available server devices such as server illustrated in . In an example the server may correspond to one example configuration of the application server described above. In the server includes a processor coupled to volatile memory and a large capacity nonvolatile memory such as a disk drive . The server may also include a floppy disc drive compact disc CD or DVD disc drive coupled to the processor . The server may also include network access ports coupled to the processor for establishing data connections with a network such as a local area network coupled to other broadcast system computers and servers or to the Internet. In context with it will be appreciated that the server of illustrates one example implementation of the communication device whereby the logic configured to transmit and or receive information corresponds to the network access ports used by the server to communicate with the network the logic configured to process information corresponds to the processor and the logic configuration to store information corresponds to any combination of the volatile memory the disk drive and or the disc drive . The optional logic configured to present information and the optional logic configured to receive local user input are not shown explicitly in and may or may not be included therein. Thus helps to demonstrate that the communication device may be implemented as a server in addition to a UE implementation as in A or B as in .

The server may be configured to facilitate a dispatcher device setting a control zone configuration for members of a communication group. For example the server may be configured to receive a control zone configuration for members of a communication group from the dispatcher device and to send the control zone configuration to the one or more members of the communication group. The server may be further configured to receive location updates from the members of the communication group and forward them to the dispatcher device. The server may include other functionality related to setting a control zone configuration for members of a communication group as described further herein.

As discussed above a significant advantage of PTT PoC PTX is the ability to connect multiple participants in a group communication. As used herein the term PTT encompasses any PTT like service such as PoC PTX etc. In a PTT group communication there may be a dispatch PTT console client also referred to as the dispatcher . The dispatch console client is a PTT client that administers or supervises other PTT clients in the communication group.

The present disclosure proposes a dispatch console client operating from a touchscreen device such as a smartphone or tablet computer that can send signaling messages to the group members also referred to as PTT clients clients users etc. to control the features available to those members. For example the dispatcher or originator may allow only a subset of group members to take the floor such that all other members may continue to listen to the talk spurts but are not able to take the floor. As another example the dispatcher may allow only a subset of group members to send or originate non voice media transmissions e.g. media share location text etc. . As yet another example the dispatcher may mute the capabilities and or applications on target members devices either at the time the call starts or at some point during the call.

The dispatcher is initially pre provisioned with group information for various closed groups in which the dispatcher is interested. The application server such as application server in is pre provisioned with closed group information. When an originator attempts to initiate a closed group call the application server will allow the closed group call only if the originator is part of the closed group membership. Where the dispatcher is a member of a closed group it can receive the name of the closed group via its UI from the user and initiate a group call among the members of the closed group. Where a downloadable application DLA client is a member of a closed group it can also receive the closed group name via the UI.

Note there are two ways to deliver PTT services. One is with an embedded device where the original equipment manufacturer OEM integrates the PTT application into the device. These are typically bulky devices with a specialized PTT button such as UE A in . The second is a downloadable application that can be installed on any smartphone such as UE B in . Such a smartphone is referred to herein as a DLA client. Members of the closed groups described herein may be either OEM PTT devices or DLA clients.

At the UI of the dispatcher receives input from the user of all the group names in which the user and thus the dispatcher is interested and of which the dispatcher may be a member. At the dispatcher sends a LIST query with the first group name in which the user dispatcher is interested to the application server . At the application server responds with a confirmation identifier confID for the group confirming whether or not the dispatcher is a member of that closed group.

The dispatcher sends as many LIST queries to the application server as the dispatcher received group names from the user. At the dispatcher sends the final LIST query and at the application server responds with a final confirmation identifier.

At the dispatcher creates a group table of the closed groups of which the dispatcher is a member and in which the dispatcher is interested thereby performing self provisioning. For example the dispatcher may create an entry in the group table such as g.00 groupName1 ConfID1 where g.00 indicates the entry number groupName1 is the name of the closed group and ConfID1 is the response from the application server indicating whether or not the dispatcher is a member of the group. The group table allows the dispatcher to perform the functionality described herein.

As illustrated in the application server can provision the members of a given closed group with a group definition that includes identifiers of the group members including one or more dispatchers and the corresponding type of each group member. At the application server sends the group definition to the dispatcher s and each group member client which may correspond to UEs A B in . At the clients expand the group membership and check the types of the members. For group members that have a member type of dispatcher there may be more than one at the clients enable location sharing with the corresponding device s . The clients may enable location sharing with only the dispatcher s so that only the dispatcher s know the locations of the clients . At the clients set their location update frequency. The location update frequency may be f 1 d where d is the distance between the client and the dispatcher s for example. Using the location of the dispatcher s may require querying the application server or the dispatcher s for the current or last known location of the dispatcher s .

Where there are multiple dispatchers the clients set location update frequencies per dispatcher. For example a client may send location updates to a first dispatcher at a frequency of f 1 d1 where d1 is the distance between the client and the first dispatcher and to a second dispatcher at a frequency of f 1 d2 where d2 is the distance between the client and the second dispatcher.

Also when there are multiple dispatchers the dispatchers may choose to share their locations with each other as well as the clients do at and . For example there may be a mobile dispatcher on site managing a local group of target clients in conjunction with a static dispatcher at the company s headquarters. In that case both dispatchers may wish to share location updates with each other.

In the example of the UE which may correspond to UE A B in is a member of a closed group of which the dispatcher is also a member. The dispatcher performs the flow illustrated in when it does not have a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card or an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI .

At the UI of the dispatcher receives the Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number MSISDN of UE . The dispatcher may receive the MSISDN from the user or from the UE . At the dispatcher sends a Short Message Service SMS validation request that includes the MSISDN to the application server . At the application server instructs the Short Message Service Center SMSC to send a validation SMS to the MSISDN. At the SMSC sends a SMS message with a personal identification number PIN to the UE .

The UE receives the PIN and the PIN needs to be entered on the dispatcher to complete the ICP loop. At the UI of the dispatcher receives the PIN sent to the UE . The dispatcher may receive the PIN from the user or from the UE . At the dispatcher sends an initial ICP request that includes the MSISDN and the PIN to the application server . At the application server sends an ICP response to the dispatcher . The flow illustrated in is then followed by the typical dispatcher registration with the application server .

To populate the map on UI with the locations of the group members the dispatcher can initiate an individual Media Share request towards the members of the closed group. Each Media Share request contains a request for the location information of the member. The members respond with their location via another Media Share message.

From to the dispatcher sends individual media share requests to the group members clients via the application server requesting their location information. From to upon receiving the media share requests for their location the clients initiate another media share transaction conveying their location information to the dispatcher via the application server in the payload of the small media sharing message. Upon receiving the location information the dispatcher can populate the UI with the location information associated with each member.

The user may also communicate with specific group members not just the entire group. Specifically the user may select icon to initiate an individual PTT call icon to initiate an individual media share such as a text messages via a small message payload or icon to initiate an individual location request. The flow illustrated in may also be triggered by the user selecting the icon . For an individual location request however the flow illustrated in would be performed only for that member.

Although illustrate four non dispatcher group members as is apparent there may be any number of such group members.

The dispatcher can transition between PTT group calls. If the dispatcher is currently in a PTT session with Group for example the dispatcher can initiate a PTT session with another group e.g. Group . In that case the PTT session with Group is terminated or possibly suspended. If the PTT session with Group is being terminated the dispatcher sends a PTT END user exit message resulting in ending the call with Group . The new PTT group call is then setup with Group .

The dispatcher or a call originator may also disable or mute features and or applications on target clients members. For example the dispatcher or the originator may allow only a subset of group members to take the floor such that all other members may continue to listen to the talk spurts but are not able to take the floor. As another example the dispatcher may allow only a subset of group members to send or originate non voice media transmissions e.g. media share location text etc. . As yet another example the dispatcher may mute the capabilities and or applications on target members devices either at the time the call starts or at some point during the call.

The dispatcher may also define geo capability control for call restrictions call type capabilities and or location update frequencies referred to as control zone configuration CZC . As illustrated in the UI of the dispatcher displays a map. This map view can trivially define a geofence. Alternatively as illustrated in an area within the map view e.g. area may be defined as a geofence. The user of the dispatcher may define area or area may be defined based on similarities between the members within area e.g. device type device capabilities applications installed etc. . In an aspect only the locations of members within the map view or geofence are obtained from a periodic feed of location information from each member registration information of each member or the query response flow illustrated in .

The geofence can also define call type capabilities. For example when a given member moves into a location covered by the geofence that member s call type capabilities can be updated. As an example the dispatcher can define a rule whereby members leaving the geofence area lose their originating capability and keep only their listening capability while members that enter the geofence area are granted both calling and listening capability.

Group members may also move in and out of a geofence based on the user changing the borders of the geofence. For example where the current map view corresponds to the geofence and is associated with a CZC the user may or may not wish to change the call capabilities restrictions and or location update frequencies for the members affected by the user changing the map view e.g. to check other portions of the map and thereby the geofence. Accordingly the user may be provided an option to set or lock the current map view such that if the map view is changed the CZC applicability area is not. In this case the CZC area could be highlighted on the map with visual boundaries while the user explores map areas around and outside the CZC zone. For example the CZZ could be displayed as a rectangular box and the user could browse in and out of it to check member locations in the entire service area.

Alternatively when the user moves around the map the CZC can move with it and apply to the group members in the new current map view. This may result in a new set of group members having the current CZC settings applied to them and the set of group members that are no longer in the current map view having those capabilities updated.

The dispatcher can also have different CZC rules or presets for different geofences which may be defined a priori or on the fly. In this case there may be a separate control panel that the user uses to define the different CZC zone policies.

When calls are placed the call type capabilities can be piggybacked in the call setup signaling. When a target member sends its location back to the dispatcher the dispatcher can send a location acknowledgment with the updated call type capability the value of which is based on whether the target member entered or left the geofence.

As illustrated in the capability control panel includes a number of checkboxes. Checkboxes to allow the user to set whether or not the target group members can call the dispatcher the closed group or individual members within the closed group. Checkboxes to allow the user to set whether or not the target group members can share media with the closed group the dispatcher or individual group members. Checkbox allows the user to set whether or not the target group members should send location updates to the dispatcher . Field allows the user to specify the frequency of the requested location updates.

Field allows the user to remove the target group member from the current call or the closed group. Field allows the user to view the capability control panel for that particular user such as capability control panel in . The user may change capabilities regarding originating and or participating in group calls. These capability changes can be piggybacked on media or signaling of the current call. Field allows the user to increase or decrease the target group member s rank with respect to obtaining the floor in a group communication. Field allows the user to increase or decrease the target group member s location frequency i.e. the frequency that the target group member sends location updates to the dispatcher .

The periodicity of location updates can vary in an inversely proportional manner to the distance from a given location such as the location of the dispatcher the center of the geofence a key location a hot zone etc. illustrates exemplary movement of a particular group member from a first location to a second location and the corresponding location update frequency changes. As illustrated in a first member of the closed group i.e. Member and a second member of the closed group i.e. Member are first and second distances d1 and d2 respectively from location . Location may be the location of the dispatcher the center of a geofence a key location a hot zone etc. The frequencies of location updates for Member and Member are f 1 d1 and f 1 d2 respectively.

As illustrated in a third member of the closed group i.e. Member moves from a distance of d3 away from location to a distance of d3 away from location . Because of the move the frequency of location updates changes from f 1 d3 to f 1 d3 . Where d3 is less than d3 f 1 d3 will be greater or more frequent than f 1 d3 .

At the dispatcher device establishes a geofence associated with a geographic area including one or more members of the communication group such as area in and or geofence in .

At the dispatcher device determines the control zone configuration for members of the communication group within the geofence. Determining the control zone configuration may include setting one or more call capabilities and a location update frequency of the members of the communication group. The location update frequency may be based on the distance between a member of the one or more members and a key location and may be an inverse function of the distance between the member of the one or more members and the key location as described above with reference to . The key location may be the location of the dispatcher device. Setting the one or more call capabilities may include setting an ability to originate a voice call among the members of the communication group an ability to originate a non voice media transmission among the members of the communication group an ability to listen to a voice call among the members of the communication group an ability to receive a non voice media transmission from other members of the communication group and or an ability to receive floor control during a call among the members of the communication group as discussed herein.

At the dispatcher device sends the control zone configuration to the one or more members of the communication group. In addition to setting the one or more call capabilities of the members of the communication group the control zone configuration may also include instructions for causing at least one member device of the communication group to disable one or more features and or applications of the at least one member device as discussed herein.

At the dispatcher device receives location updates from each of the one or more members of the communication group based on the location update frequency. The one or more members of the communication group may send location updates only to the dispatcher device.

At the dispatcher device updates a user interface of the dispatcher device showing locations of the one or more members of the communication group within the geofence with the received location updates. Blocks and are illustrated with dashed lines because these aspects are not required to be performed in every embodiment of the disclosure.

Although not illustrated in the dispatcher device may update the geofence such that after the updating a subset of the one or more members are no longer within the geofence. In that case the control zone configuration may revoked for the subset of the one or more members as described above with reference to .

Further although not illustrated in the dispatcher device may also send a location request to the one or more members of the communication group and display locations of the one or more members of the communication group on a map representing the geofence.

In an aspect the dispatcher device may be a member of a plurality of communication groups and the communication group may be a first communication group of the plurality of communication groups. In that case the dispatcher device may establish a second geofence associated with a geographic area including one or more members of a second communication group of the plurality of communication groups determine a second control zone configuration for members of the second communication group within the second geofence and send the second control zone configuration to the one or more members of the second communication group. The dispatcher device may display group information for an active communication group of the plurality of communication groups as described above with reference to . The group information may include a list of group members of the active communication group and icons for calling a member of the active communication group sending media to the member of the active communication group and initiating a location request to the member of the active communication group as described above with reference to . The group information may also include a list of group members of the active communication group and icons for initiating a group call among the active communication group sending media to the active communication group and initiating a location request for the active communication group as also described above with reference to .
