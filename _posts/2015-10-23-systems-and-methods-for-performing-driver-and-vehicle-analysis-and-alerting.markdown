Driver performance can be important to the successful operation of a fleet of vehicles. Drivers are expected to follow the rules of the road as well as the safety considerations while operating the vehicles of the fleet. Moreover vehicle and fleet management systems generally strive to maintain fleet vehicles in good operating condition. Vehicles undergo scheduled maintenance and other vehicles services in order to keep the vehicles in good operating condition such as oil changes brake pad replacement timing belt replacements and other services. These services can prevent or reduce the possibility of breakdowns or catastrophic failure to the vehicles. Breakdown or failure of vehicles during operation can result in unnecessary downtime and costs for the vehicles delayed orders accidents and other problems.

Advantageously in certain embodiments this disclosure describes embodiments of real time driver and vehicle analysis and alerting features that can be used to improve operation of a fleet of vehicles. The features can be used to identify potential problems with a driver or vehicle and provide a recommended treatment or service in real time. In certain embodiments user input may be received that is associated with the real time feedback and a rule violation that triggered the real time feedback. The user input may for example be associated with an indication of the rule violation that triggered the real time feedback or further analyzed to update the driver and vehicle analysis.

Any of the systems and processes described herein can be performed in real time or near real time. As used herein the term real time and the like in addition to having its ordinary meaning can mean rapidly or within a certain expected or predefined time interval and not necessarily immediately. For instance real time feedback may be provided within a few seconds few minutes or 5 minutes or 10 minutes or some other short period of time after receiving information that triggers the determination of the feedback.

The vehicle analysis module A or B can collect and gather data and information about the engine from the vehicle computer and or data from other sensors in or on the vehicle. The onboard vehicle analysis module B can communicate the collected vehicle data and information to the vehicle management system . In another embodiment the onboard vehicle analysis module B filters or processes the data prior to sending the data to the vehicle management system . The onboard vehicle analysis module B can communicate some or all of the filtered data and information to the offboard vehicle analysis module A of the vehicle management system .

If the onboard vehicle analysis module B is unable to connect to a network or communicate with the vehicle management system the onboard vehicle analysis module B can save and send the vehicle data when the onboard vehicle analysis module B is able to communicate with the server again. In some embodiments the vehicle analysis module can operatively couple with a mobile communication device located within the vehicle such as a cell phone or other in vehicle network capable electronic device. Vehicle diagnostic processes can be performed by the onboard vehicle analysis module B. The vehicle diagnostic processes can also be performed by the offboard vehicle analysis module A. In some embodiments an initial analysis is performed by the onboard vehicle analysis module B and further analysis is performed by the offboard vehicle analysis module A.

The vehicle data collected by the onboard vehicle analysis module B can include vehicle condition information and engine data such as vehicle year make model engine drive train mileage engine hours start cycles and other information related to vehicle condition. The vehicle data can also include check engine lights fault codes DTC codes engine events service intervals and other data collected from the engine computer. As mentioned above the vehicle data collected by the onboard vehicle analysis module B can also include sensor data obtained from other sensors in the vehicle such as tire pressure sensors accelerometers gyroscopes temperature sensors driver identification sensors for example that communicate with an ID badge of a driver via RFID or the like combinations of the same or the like.

The onboard vehicle analysis module B and the vehicle management system can provide or analyze additional data that can be used for diagnostic analysis. For example such data can include data provided by the manufacturer regarding diagnostic conditions data obtained by crowd sourcing or otherwise analyzing data provided by a community of fleet vehicles including for example predictive diagnoses based on community analysis of diagnostic trends or the like.

The offboard vehicle analysis module A can output the analysis and prognostic information obtained from the onboard vehicle analysis module B to one of the management devices operated by a fleet administrator or the like which may be a mobile device or any other device configured to receive notifications and updates from the offboard vehicle analysis module A. The output can include for example diagnostic codes or other diagnoses of vehicle problems driver warnings a list of proposed corrective actions alarms and or other information provided by the onboard vehicle analysis module B to the system . Similarly the onboard vehicle analysis module B can provide such outputs directly to the driver via an onboard computer for example on a display thereof or via wired or wireless communication to one of the driver devices A . . . N collectively driver devices such as to a phone a smartphone a mobile device a wearable device and a computing device associated with the driver for example possessed nearby or carried by the driver . The outputs to the driver can include any of the outputs described above as well as optionally navigation directions to dispatch the driver to a repair facility for example a nearest repair facility . The output could include a list of options of available service centers to perform the identified services from which the driver can select and then be navigated to. Depending on the severity of the predicted failure the outputs to the driver may for more severe problems provide rerouting to a nearest approved maintenance facility and navigate the driver to that location. For less severe problems the outputs to the driver can indicate that maintenance should be performed soon or the like.

The output can also provide information and alerts to vehicle management system or other fleet management personnel. The onboard vehicle analysis module B can analyze diagnostic data against one or more thresholds that are to be met prior to proceeding with changes to the vehicle route and or recommending repairs. The thresholds can be machine based and or human based thresholds. Machine based thresholds could be determined by algorithms based on factors such as cost time energy usage disruptive effect and others. Human based thresholds can include one or more approvals from the driver vehicle maintenance personnel management personnel or others.

In some embodiments the onboard vehicle analysis module B can filter data received from the engine computer and send a subset of the engine computer data or other in vehicle sensor data to the offboard vehicle analysis module A. In some embodiments the onboard vehicle analysis module B monitors the data received by the engine computer for changes. In one embodiment when a change is detected the updated data can be sent to the offboard vehicle analysis module A. For example if the onboard vehicle analysis module B receives data from the engine computer continuously or substantially continuously the onboard vehicle analysis module B may solely send data that was different from a previous set of data to the offboard vehicle analysis module A to conserve bandwidth. In another embodiment the onboard vehicle analysis module B sends data periodically such as once every hour or once every few hours or even once a day or at longer intervals for measured parameters that change slowly.

Tire pressure data is an example of data that generally changes slowly. Instead of reporting tire pressure data to the vehicle management system continuously or at frequent intervals such as every 1 to 2 minutes the onboard vehicle analysis module B can instead send updated tire pressure data to the vehicle management system once per hour or couple of hours once per day or less frequently. In another embodiment the onboard vehicle analysis module B sends updated tire pressure data to the vehicle management system solely when the tire pressure changes more than a threshold amount. In another embodiment the onboard vehicle analysis module B increases a frequency of transmission of sensor or engine data when the data changes more than a threshold amount. More generally the onboard vehicle analysis module B can reduce compress or otherwise filter the diagnostic data sent to the vehicle management system .

The in vehicle devices A . . . N collectively referred to as in vehicle devices also include a driver alerting module . The driver alerting module can be implemented by one or more physical computing devices examples of which are provided herein. The driver alerting module can perform onboard and or offboard analysis and may be implemented in the system as offboard module A and or in the in vehicle devices as onboard module B . The driver alerting module A or B can receive the analyzed data from the vehicle analysis module on a consistent basis in order to identify risky driving behaviors like heavy braking and acceleration average or maximum speeds and so forth for a driver of a vehicle. In turn the driver alerting module can output alerts via wired or wireless communication for presentation to a driver of a vehicle to notify the driver of the risky driver behaviors and provide coaching to improve the driving performance of the driver. For example the vehicle can include an attached display for example the display may be part of an entertainment system of the vehicle that displays the alerts or coaching from the driver alerting module providing driver information related to driver safety how they are well driving heavy braking or acceleration events speeding occurrences fuel efficiency suggestions for improving driving and idle times for instance. Additionally or alternatively one of the driver devices associated with the driver of the vehicle can receive via wired or wireless communication for example directly from the onboard driver alerting module B via Bluetooth or near field communication or indirectly from the driver alerting module via the network the alerts or coaching from the driver alerting module and display the alerts or coaching and for instance show a plurality of different outputs relating to driver safety work efficiency carbon Impact fuel efficiency idle time electric and alternate fuel source vehicle performance traffic weather vehicle skills and other custom navigation options for example. The alerts and coaching from the driver alerting module can be provided in the form of real time audible or textual messages color changing displays and vibrating of items such as by vibrating one of the driver devices chairs of the vehicle or steering wheel of the vehicle for example.

A radio communicates with the gateway module either wirelessly or through a wired connection for example with a serial cable or the like . The radio includes a GPS module that detects vehicle position. The radio can transmit data received from the gateway module to the vehicle management system . The radio can also communicate vehicle positioning data received from the GPS module to the vehicle management system . In one embodiment the radio communicates with the vehicle management system by placing a cell phone call to a server of the vehicle management system . The radio can also communicate with the server at the vehicle management system using TCP IP protocols. By sending data frequently or periodically the radio can keep the connection to the server open which can guarantee or help to guarantee data reliability.

Any number of in vehicle sensors located within the vehicle can communicate with the gateway module . The in vehicle sensors can be located throughout the vehicle including for example the engine tires vehicle body trailer cargo areas and other locations on and within the vehicle. Some examples of vehicle sensors include engine oil sensors fuel level sensors light sensors door sensors ignition sensors temperature sensors including in cab and in trailer and tire pressure sensors. At least some of the in vehicle sensors can communicate with the engine computer or other engine hardware configured to receive and process the data. The in vehicle sensors can also be located remotely and can transmit the data wirelessly to the engine computer or other data processing hardware. For example a tire pressure sensor could wirelessly transmit tire pressure data to the engine computer for processing.

Likewise the gateway module can also include sensors. One example of a sensor that may be included in the gateway is an accelerometer. An accelerometer can detect hard braking cornering and acceleration. The accelerometer can therefore allow position coordinates to be updated without resort to GPS or triangulation technology. For example the accelerometer can provide for short term position reporting that operates without resorting to GPS signals. The gateway module can offer a low cost longitude latitude capability and combined hard braking sensor for vehicle history applications such as the vehicle history systems and methods described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13 251 129 titled History Timeline Display for Vehicle Fleet Management filed Sep. 30 2011 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As a device in certain embodiments the gateway module can enable data from multiple sensors to be acquired without adding wires or optical connections to the vehicle for those sensors.

The gateway module can be in communication with some or all of the in vehicle sensors . For example the gateway module can be coupled to an OBDII or CAN bus in the vehicle to thereby receive in vehicle sensor information from the engine computer. In some embodiments one or more in vehicle sensors can be directly coupled to the gateway module or the gateway module can be configured to communicate wirelessly with the in vehicle sensors. For example the gateway module could receive cargo bay temperature data from a temperature sensor wirelessly transmitting the data. The wireless sensors can use point to point transmission using wireless transmission standards such as Bluetooth or Zigbee.

The processor and memory of the gateway module can implement various features. Among others the processor of the gateway module can perform the operations associated with the onboard vehicle analysis module and the driver alerting module described herein. The gateway module can act as an intermediary processing platform for the vehicle management system . The gateway module can process the data received from the in vehicle sensors and send a subset of the total data collected to the vehicle management system . The gateway module can collect hundreds or thousands or more data points from sensors in vehicle sensors and the engine computer. The gateway module can among other things analyze categorize compress or otherwise process the data before transmitting it to the vehicle management system . By preprocessing the data prior to sending the information to the vehicle management system the gateway module can determine what data to send to the vehicle management system which can reduce redundant processing and bandwidth used to continually transmit vehicle data.

The gateway module can monitor several vehicle characteristics. The sensors can provide information to the gateway module at a specific frequency for each vehicle characteristic however the sensors may generally be recording data at a faster rate than the monitored vehicle characteristic is changing. As such sending all of the data to the vehicle management system every time a sensor provides data can waste bandwidth and provide redundant data points for the vehicle management system to process. Advantageously in certain embodiments instead of sending all of this data to the vehicle management system the gateway module processes the data and selectively updates the vehicle management system . The gateway module can also compress the data that is received. The gateway module can selectively compress portions of data using compression techniques including any lossy or lossless compression techniques. For example the data relating to vehicle characteristics that are slowly changing can be compressed.

The gateway module can process vehicle characteristics according to the rate at which the characteristics change. For example engine characteristics can range from relatively slower changing characteristics such as tire pressure or average fuel consumption to relatively faster changing characteristics such as engine RPM and speed. The gateway module can provide updates to the vehicle management system using different update approaches for each vehicle characteristic including periodic updates threshold based updates event based updates user specified updates and or a combination of methods.

Periodic updates can provide updates to the vehicle management system at a specified frequency. For example the gateway module may update the remaining vehicle fuel data every 5 minutes. Threshold based updates can provide updates when the value of the vehicle characteristic meets or exceeds a specified threshold. The thresholds can be static determined dynamically by the system user specified or determined using any other method. The thresholds can be absolute such as a specific value or relative such as a percentage based change a specific number of units. For example tire pressure data could be updated when the tire pressure changes by 10 or when it changes by 2 psi or if pressure drops below 35 psi. Event based updates can prompt updates after a specific event occurs. For example an update of all the vehicle characteristics may be provided when the engine starts or when an engine error is detected.

The gateway module can use a combination of methods or algorithms to determine the frequency of the updates to the vehicle management system . For example the tire pressure data could have a periodic update and a threshold based update. The tire pressure data could be updated every 30 minutes. However if there was a blowout it can be beneficial to have a more rapid or immediate update to the tire pressure. As such the gateway module could evaluate the tire pressure against a threshold that updates tire pressure when a change is detected. The gateway module can provide update routines that are dependent on the operational phase of the vehicle such as warm up operation versus normal operation. As engine conditions stabilize after warm up the gateway module can increase the intervals at which updates are provided to the vehicle management system . In some embodiments the gateway module can send the updated data to the vehicle management system and the raw data. The raw vehicle data can include some or all of the data that the gateway module receives from the sensors and vehicle computer. The raw data can be transmitted with or without the preprocessed updated vehicle data.

More generally in certain embodiments the gateway module can be a system that performs wired and or wireless data acquisition within a vehicle. The gateway module can pool data from various sensors apply time stamps to the data reformat the data compress the data encode the data and or encrypt the data. Software running on the gateway module can manage data acquisition and data formatting. The gateway module can therefore acquire diagnostic bus and motor vehicle status data and forward the data alerts or coaching directly to the vehicle management system or another device such as one of the driver devices via Bluetooth WiFi Ethernet RS232 422 USB or other suitable wired or wireless physical interfaces.

In some embodiments feedback about the driving performance of a driver during a day can be provided to the driver at the end of the day. For example the vehicle data can be transmitted from a vehicle or a gateway device such as one of the in vehicle devices associated with the vehicle to the vehicle management system . The vehicle management system can then process the vehicle data in due course to evaluate the performance of the driver. Upon the conclusion of this processing the vehicle management system can transmit information about the performance of the driver to the vehicle or the gateway device associated with the vehicle for presentation to the driver.

Additionally or alternatively the in vehicle devices can be used to leverage the application programming interfaces APIs that are available in a vehicle to collect and process the vehicle data and provide real time feedback on the driving behavior of a driver of the vehicle. The driver alerting module can be used to output an alert or coaching for presentation to the driver in an unobtrusive way. For instance the driver alerting module can output the alert or coaching to one of the driver devices associated with the driver or an in vehicle system such as an in vehicle display speaker seat belt or vehicle entertainment system associated with the vehicle that the driver is driving to alert for example a vibration or change of item color or coach for example verbal or written information the driver in real time about violations of laws or company rules while the driver is driving.

In one embodiment when a driver enters a vehicle one of the driver devices associated with the driver can tie or associate to the vehicle or the gateway module . For example a vehicle identification number VIN can be tied or associated to a smart phone of the driver so that the vehicle data gathered by the gateway module can further be associated with the driver of the vehicle. As a result when the driver drives different vehicles the vehicle data associated with driving each of the different vehicles can be compiled and associated with the same driver.

The driver alerting module can alert based on one or more conditions. For example the driver alerting module can alert when a driver exceeds a certain acceleration or deceleration limit. As another example the driver alerting module can alert when a driver exceeds a certain acceleration or deceleration limit for example more than 5 miles per hours in one second or 10 miles per hours in one second when a vehicle is traveling less than one threshold speed for example 20 miles per hour or greater than another threshold speed for example 60 miles per hour . Moreover the driver alerting module can perform computations with the vehicle data parameters to come up with a score or to determine thresholds such as the threshold used for alerting the driver.

In view of the communication between the in vehicle devices and the vehicle management system the vehicle management system can provide information about roads vehicle histories on roads driver histories or a driver s organization to the in vehicle devices so that the in vehicle devices can make more informed or appropriate alerts or coaching.

The driver alerting module can look for patterns over time in the driving behavior of the driver. For example the driver alerting module can observe bad driving behavior over a series of days or weeks such as repeated hard braking. To encourage better driving behavior however the driver alerting module can note positive trends in bad driving behavior and provide coaching messages such as for example you are braking hard but you are doing better than you did last week so keep up the good work. Such tracking patterns can further facilitate a gamification of the alerts and coaching by the driver alerting module where the drivers can receive achievements based on driving performance. As a result the coaching can be more engaging to drivers promoting further improved driving performance.

In one embodiment the driver alerting module can enable drivers to provide explanations of bad driving behavior or violations. For example if a dog runs out in front of the vehicle and the driver slams on the brakes the driver may receive a hard brake violation. The onboard driver alerting module B in turn can receive a user input from the driver such as a bookmark of the violation for later discussion a predefined text explanation of the violation or a dictation of the explanation so that the driver can associate an explanation with the violation and for example potentially not be penalized for the violation. The driver may input the user input via a user interface or acoustic sensor of one of the in vehicle devices or one or more other devices associated with the driver or vehicle and configured to communicate with the one of the in vehicle devices .

The driver alerting module can also determine whether the driver is likely driving and inform the driver regarding a needed change in an hours of service status. The term hours of service status in addition to having its ordinary meaning can refer to whether a driver may be permitted continue driving in view of a total number of consecutive driving hours that the driver has been driving. For example if the onboard vehicle analysis module B determines that the driver still has the seatbelt engaged the vehicle engine is on and the vehicle stopped then the driver may be likely stuck in traffic and is probably still driving. If the driver has not finished a shift the hours of service status of the driver may not need to be changed. On the other hand if the driver has finished the shift the driver may be alerted to potential needed change in the hours of service status of the driver.

Because the data processed by the driver alerting module can be collected at least in part from the onboard vehicle analysis module B that are available in a vehicle the vehicle data used by the driver alerting module can be more reliable or detailed than information from other sources such as the data from one of the driver devices . The vehicle data from the onboard vehicle analysis module B can also be very timely and enable the real time feedback by the driver alerting module .

In some embodiments an initial analysis alerting or coaching can be output by the onboard driver alerting module B and further analysis alerting or coaching can be performed by the offboard driver alerting module A. Additionally or alternatively the onboard driver alerting module B can perform a subset of types of alerting or coaching and the offboard driver alerting module A can perform another subset of types of alerting or coaching that can be at least in part the same or different form the subset of types of alerting or coaching performed by the onboard driver alerting module B. Such local processing by the onboard driver alerting module B can relieve the processing burden on the vehicle management system because vehicle data processing can be performed by the onboard driver alerting module B and shared with the vehicle management system so that the offboard driver alerting module A need not perform the same or similar processing of the vehicle data. In an example computing environment that includes thousands or tens of thousands of in vehicle devices a significant amount of processing can be offloaded from the vehicle management system to some or all of the in vehicle devices .

The driver alerting module can provide valuable a feedback to a driver to improve the drivers driving performance. However the feedback may be inaccurate at times or may be inappropriate. The feedback can for example indicate that a vehicle or driver has committed a rule violation although the vehicle or driver has not actually committed the rule violation. The vehicle data collected by the vehicle analysis module and used by the driver alerting module to determine the rule violation may have been inaccurate and the driver alerting module may as a result incorrectly determine that the rule violation occurred. In another example the rule data used to determine whether a rule violation occurred may be inaccurate and thus the driver alerting module may incorrectly determine the occurrence of the rule violation when the rule violation itself is erroneous. Moreover the reason for a rule violation may not be the fault of a vehicle or driver or the vehicle or driver may have taken appropriate actions given particular circumstances and yet received feedback that discouraged the appropriate actions.

To for instance enable more accurate appropriate meaningful or valuable feedbacks the driver alerting module B can receive user inputs from the driver responding to the feedbacks provided by the driver alerting module . The ability of the driver alerting module to receive the user inputs from a driver can enable a two way exchange of information between the driver alerting module and the driver about rule violations and feedbacks. The driver alerting module can determine the rule violations and provide feedback further in view of past user inputs from one or more drivers and thereby better determine rule violations and provide more useful feedbacks in the future. In turn a driver may better trust the driver alerting module to provide valuable information as well as the opportunity for greater understanding when there may be errors associated with the rule violations or feedbacks.

At block the onboard vehicle analysis module B can gather vehicle data for a vehicle. For example the onboard vehicle analysis module B can receive vehicle data from the in vehicle sensors around the vehicle or an engine computer of the vehicle while the driver is operating or driving the vehicle. As described herein the vehicle data can include data regarding geographic coordinates speed seatbelt usage fuel efficiency braking idle times pitch yaw and routes associated with a vehicle. The onboard vehicle analysis module B can moreover receive vehicle data or driver data from one or more other sources such as the vehicle management system or via data inputs from the driver of the vehicle or a user of one of the management devices .

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can process the vehicle data gathered by the onboard vehicle analysis module B to determine whether the vehicle or driver committed a rule violation. The onboard driver alerting module B can for instance access from the memory multiple rules that prescribe rule violations associated with activities of the vehicle. The multiple rules can provide algorithms conditional statements or thresholds and the like that the onboard driver alerting module B can compare in real time to the vehicle data or use to process the vehicle data to detect rule violations.

One approach of the multiple rules is for the multiple rules provide thresholds for determining whether the rule violation has occurred. Example thresholds include thresholds for speed braking acceleration idling pitch yaw or any other parameter that may be used for determining real time feedback. Additionally or alternatively the multiple rules may include other information for determining violations such as driver abilities vehicles types geographic areas and associated thresholds for determining rules violations within the driver abilities vehicle types and geographic areas. For instance the onboard driver alerting module B can compare a speed parameter from the vehicle data to a threshold to determine whether a speeding violation has occurred. In another example the onboard driver alerting module B may determine that the vehicle data indicates the vehicle performed a hard braking rule violation. Other example determinations of violations include comparisons of hard braking fuel efficiency or vehicle health parameters to respective thresholds. In some embodiments predefined thresholds may initially be set by a vehicle owner or a fleet manager. Additionally or alternatively the determination of real time feedback may be based on combinations of parameters such as speed acceleration traction control posted speed limits or some combination thereof. Historical real time feedback may further weight or influence the severity of current real time feedback. In addition the type of vehicle being driven by the driver can influence whether a rule violation may be determined for instance certain public safety vehicles such as ambulances may violate normal traffic laws at certain times.

The multiple rules can relate to many different types of rule violations. For instance the multiple rules can provide rules for fuel efficient driving minimum wear on vehicle driving vehicle steering handling consistent with safe driving proper use of signals among other possible rules.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can determine a feedback for the driver responsive to the rule violation. The onboard driver alerting module B can for instance access from the memory multiple driver feedbacks that prescribe feedbacks to the driver about rule violations including the rule violation. The multiple feedbacks can include multiple output feedback options as well as algorithms conditional statements or thresholds and the like that the onboard driver alerting module B can compare in real time to the rule violation or use to process the rule violation to determine the feedback. The multiple output feedback options can for instance include audible visual or tactile feedback as well as different alert parameters such messages durations or frequencies. The multiple output feedback options can additionally be positive to encourage good driving behavior or negative to discourage bad driving behavior.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can output the feedback for presentation to the driver. The feedback can be output for instance using one or more of the approaches described herein. The feedback can be intended to attempt to improve a driving performance of the driver. In one example where the onboard driver alerting module B determines that the hard braking violation occurred the onboard driver alerting module B can output both audible and visual feedback to the driver indicating that the driver should try to brake more slowly in the future. In another example the onboard driver alerting module B can output an animation on a screen responsive to the rule violation for example a green visual animation such as a plant which grows the better the driver drives or a plant turning brown or dying as the driver drivers less well or quotations or facts regarding emissions or messages from celebrities. In some instances the feedback may be delayed for a fixed or variable time until the driver reaches a particular performance threshold. In yet another example if the driver exhibits good driving behavior the onboard driver alerting module B can present the driver with a message such as Congratulations You completed X days in a row without any violations. In some embodiments the feedback can additionally be shared more broadly such as with a manager of the driver or with multiple drivers in a fleet of vehicles so that the manager or the multiple drivers may also benefit from the feedback.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can receive user input from the driver responding to the feedback. The user input can be received for instance via a selectable interface element such as a button or touchscreen an acoustic sensor like a microphone positioned around or near the vehicle an image sensor of a video camera that used detect user gestures or another type of input interface. The user input can include i an explanation by the driver for the rule violation or ii a request from the driver to discuss the rule violation at a later time for instance such that the onboard driver alerting module B prompts the driver for the explanation at the later time.

In one example the onboard driver alerting module B can receive the user input when the driver provides an audio input to the acoustic sensor that matches a capture initiation input such as by speaking the word discuss and the onboard driver alerting module B can then capture the additional provided audio from the driver that includes the explanation for the rule violation. In another example the onboard driver alerting module B outputs the feedback on a display as an alert and offers the driver multiple possible textual explanations on the display for the rule violation form which the driver select one to submit to the onboard driver alerting module B. In yet another example the driver may select a Discuss user interface element as described in further detail herein. In an example where the driver would like to dispute the feedback about a speeding violation the driver may provide the user input that indicates the posted real world speed limit does not match the speed limited presumed by the onboard driver alerting module B. In yet a further example the onboard driver alerting module B can receive the user input when the driver performs a gesture captured by a video camera that matches a capture initiation input a bookmark request input or a gesture explanation input and the onboard driver alerting module B can for instance then determine to request the explanation for the rule violation at a later time or capture video or audio from the driver that includes the explanation for the rule violation.

In some implementations the driver may be provided a limited window of time for example 30 seconds 1 minute or 5 minutes during which to provide the user input after which time the onboard driver alerting module B may no longer accept the user input. Moreover in some implementations the driver may be requested to provide the user input in response to an inquiry message received from the vehicle management system such as due to a request initiated by one of the management devices .

In some embodiments the driver may provide the user input in stages. For example the driver may initially bookmark the feedback notification and then at a later time provide a written or spoken response or select from a list of explanations regarding the feedback. As a result the driver can respond to the feedback in real time to acknowledge the feedback but provide details at the later time. In some instances this may advantageously reduce the amount of distraction to the driver while driving is in progress so that the driver s attention may remain on the road. The driver moreover may submit biometrics data as part of the explanation in some implementations. For example blood or urine analysis data or other data indicative of whether the driver was sleeping or having a cardiac event and the like.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can store the user input in association with an indication of the rule violation in the memory . Such storage can enable later access of the user input and the indication by the driver of the vehicle or facilitate temporary storage of the user input and the indication before their communication to another device such as the vehicle management system or one of the management devices .

The process can additionally in certain embodiments create a useful feedback loop for the driver and the onboard driver alerting module B as well as a fleet of drivers and the vehicle management system .

In one example the onboard driver alerting module B can use the user input to adjust for instance rewrite or revise an associated algorithm or conditional statement or process differently for instance change an associated weighting or threshold the multiple rules or the multiple feedbacks stored in the memory . As a result the onboard driver alerting module B may in effect be i better able to determine erroneous rule violations or feedbacks ii more or less forgiving or understanding towards the rule violation or feedback or iii more or less inclined to discard ignore or report the rule violation or feedback to the driver. In some implementations the onboard driver alerting module B can update the thresholds for the multiple rules or multiple feedbacks based on the user input. In one such implementation the onboard driver alerting module B can use the user input and a previous threshold to determine a new threshold for a rule violation. Continuing with the speeding example the user input regarding the feedback may indicate to the onboard driver alerting module B that the threshold or speed limit for particular geographic area is inaccurate and the onboard driver alerting module B may thus determine a new threshold. Again in the speeding example the second time a driver may drive through the geographic area at the same speed the driver may not receive the feedback because the onboard driver alerting module B had increased the speeding threshold.

In another example the onboard driver alerting module B can determine rule violations and output feedbacks using collected user inputs from multiple drivers of multiple vehicles in a vehicle fleet. For instance the onboard driver alerting module B may receive data associated with user input data from the vehicle management system to adjust for instance rewrite or revise an associated algorithm or conditional statement or process differently for instance change an associated weighting or threshold the multiple rules or the multiple feedbacks stored in the memory . As a result the onboard driver alerting module B may in effect be i better able to determine erroneous rule violations or feedbacks ii more or less forgiving or understanding towards the rule violation or feedback or iii more or less inclined to discard ignore or report the rule violation or feedback to the driver. In one implementation the onboard driver alerting module B may update a threshold for speeding violations in a particular geographic area based on one or more user inputs for instance because the onboard driver alerting module B may have had an incorrect speed limit stored for a particular geographic area and may update to the correct speed limit for that geographic area based on the one or more user inputs.

In some embodiments at block the determination of the rule violation can further trigger more than a default level of data collection or even new data collection by the onboard vehicle analysis module B. This may be so that additional data is available for understanding the rule violation determining feedback for the driver or providing greater details about the rule violation to the driver or manager of the driver at a later time. In one example the determination of the rule violation can initiate the capture of image data with an image sensor like a camera and the image data can be saved in the memory along with the Association to the indication of the rule violation or the user input. The onboard vehicle analysis module B can additionally provide functionally for the driver to request that the conditions or details or information thereof for example environment traffic signal speed limit low bridge and the like around the rule violation be replayed over a time such as on a display at a later time so that the driver may better understand the context of the rule violation when the driver may no longer be operating or driving the vehicle.

Although the process is described as being implemented at least in part by the onboard driver alerting module B the process can further be incremented at least in part by the driver alerting module .

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can transmit the user input and the indication of the rule violation to the vehicle management system . Moreover in some embodiments the onboard driver alerting module B can transmit indications of rule violations to the vehicle management system so that the indications are presented differently to a manager of the driver or vehicle when the indications have associated user inputs. For instance when indications have associated user inputs the indications may be displayed to the manager on a lower priority violation screen than the indications not having associated user inputs. This can be because the user inputs to note a greater likelihood that the indication of the rule violation may require less attention or investigation by the manager.

At block the onboard driver learning module B can update rule violation data stored in the memory in view of the user input. For example the onboard driver learning module B can adjust the multiple rules stored in the memory based at least on the user input.

At block the onboard driver learning module B can update feedback data stored in the memory in view of the user input. For example the onboard driver learning module B can adjust the multiple feedbacks stored in the memory based at least on the user input.

At block the onboard driver learning module B can update maintained profile data for the driver or the onboard vehicle analysis module B can update maintained profile data for the vehicle. The profile data can be used to track trends over time or predict maintenance for the vehicle or recommend training or corrective actions for the driver. The user input may be used to change how the indication of the rule violation impacts the profile data such as by removing the indication of the rule violation from the profile data diminishing its significance or rejecting the user input as a valid explanation.

Additionally or alternatively the user input may be used by the driver alerting module B to update a driver s score in game data. As discussed herein a driver may receive a score by the onboard driver alerting module B based on their driving behavior. Their score may be negatively impacted or decremented based at least on the driving behavior factors discussed herein. Further the onboard driver alerting module B may use the user input to waive the reduction in the driving score. For example if the onboard driver alerting module B deducts a point from a driver s score based on a hard braking violation the user input may cause the onboard driver alerting module B to not deduct the point from the driver s score.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can use the user input to revise component authorization or control data. For example the onboard driver alerting module B can i adjust one or more settings for instance modes of operation data gathering approaches sensor sensitivities or the like of the vehicle management system the vehicle analysis module driver alerting module or components of the vehicle like the in vehicle sensors ii install updated operating or calibration software on the vehicle management system the vehicle analysis module or driver alerting module iii reset a component of the vehicle iv cycle power of a component of the vehicle v display a message for instance recommendations like the quality descriptor for addressing the quality issue or to bring a vehicle in for maintenance service on a screen vi disable a component of the vehicle vii trigger a troubleshooting software to evaluate a component of the vehicle the vehicle analysis module or driver alerting module viii adjust a routing schedule for the vehicle for instance adjusting a route determined by the routing module to add a maintenance service stop in place of one or more previously assigned delivery stops and reassign the one or more previously assigned delivery stops to another vehicle ix order a new part for the vehicle or x schedule a maintenance appointment for a vehicle or driver.

Although the process is described as performing all of the real time user input usages described at blocks and the process can instead be reduced to just one block two blocks three blocks or four blocks of blocks and of the process . In addition although the process is described as being implemented at least in part by the onboard driver alerting module B the process can further be incremented at least in part by the driver alerting module .

The user interfaces and can allow a driver to provide a user input responding to real time feedback. The user interface can depict a rule violation or warning history for the driver. In some embodiments the user interface may be presented after the driver selects a particular rule violation warning type in area . The driver may further select a particular rule violation in the user interface and be presented with the user interface . The user interface may present a map showing a location of where the rule violation or warning occurred. The user interface includes a user interface element that enables a user to provide the user input to respond to the real time feedback. For example user selection of the user interface element may cause presentation of the user interface that enables a user to further discuss the rule violation. The user interface includes a message area and a submission element . The driver may input a response message for example I was driving within the posted speed limit. into the message area and may transmit the response message to the onboard driver alerting module B via selection of the submission element for storage in the memory . The selection of the submission element may further transmit the response message to the vehicle management system for presentation to a manager of the driver in some implementations.

As discussed herein in some embodiments the systems described herein may perform local processing to reduce remote processing or reduce the use of remote computational resources. For example local processing by the onboard driver alerting module B can relieve the processing burden on the vehicle management system because vehicle data processing can be performed by the onboard driver alerting module B and shared with the vehicle management system so that the offboard driver alerting module A need not perform the same or similar processing of the vehicle data.

At block the onboard vehicle analysis module B can gather vehicle data locally which may be similar to block of the process . At block the onboard driver alerting module B can process the vehicle data gathered by the onboard vehicle analysis module B to determine real time feedback locally such as alerts and coaching for a driver of the vehicle. Block may be similar to blocks and of the process . At block the onboard driver alerting module B can output the real time feedback for presentation to the driver of the vehicle to attempt to improve the driving performance of the driver which may be similar to block of the process .

At block the onboard vehicle analysis module B can transmit the processed vehicle data from block to another device or system such as the vehicle management system . For example the rule violation or warning data that was computed by the on the other driver scores can be indicative of driving performances board vehicle analysis module B may be transmitted to the vehicle management system . Accordingly portions of the vehicle data may not transmitted to the vehicle management system which can reduce the network load or processing resources on the vehicle management system . At block the vehicle management system can use the processed vehicle data. One example use is that the vehicle management system may generate metadata or summary data regarding drivers or vehicles. Other example uses of the processed data include automatically adjusting one or more settings of the vehicle management system transmitting commands to the vehicle or any number of uses such as the uses for the user inputs as described herein.

The driver alerting module can maintain driver scores for drivers indicative of the driver s driving performances. Such driver scores can be maintained by telematics applications used by the drivers and be composites of multiple parameters from vehicle data or other data sources for example driver profiles or histories and provide an overall sense of a driver s success at particular task. The driver scores advantageously in certain embodiments can be shared with multiple drivers across a fleet of vehicles and offer metrics or goals for individual drivers on their own driving performances. This can desirably improve driving performances of the multiple drivers in the fleet of vehicles. However because the driver scores within the telematics application can represent a side feature or distraction for the drivers rather than a primary function for the drivers access to the driver scores within the telematics application can be controlled.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can calculate a driver score for a driver of the vehicle based at least on vehicle data for a vehicle. For example as described herein the onboard vehicle analysis module B can receive vehicle data from the in vehicle sensors around the vehicle or an engine computer of the vehicle while the driver is operating or driving the vehicle and the onboard vehicle analysis module B can provide the vehicle data to the onboard driver alerting module B. The onboard driver alerting module B can process the vehicle data according to a program instruction of multiple program instructions that prescribe conditions of a vehicle to be monitored such as part of a status tracking program. The onboard driver alerting module B can for instance access from the memory the multiple program instructions which can provide algorithms conditional statements or thresholds and the like that the onboard driver alerting module B can compare to the vehicle data or use to process the vehicle data to calculate the driver score. As one example the driver score can be indicative of fuel efficiency for the vehicle when driven by the driver. As another example the driver score can be indicative of on time deliveries by the vehicle when driven by the driver. As yet another example the driver score can be indicative of counts of rule violations by the vehicle when driven by the driver.

In some implementations the onboard driver alerting module B can first determine whether the driver is driving for a work task or a non work task before performing the operation at block . The onboard driver alerting module B can for instance make this determination based on an instruction received from the vehicle management system . In response to determining that the driver is driving for the work task the onboard driver alerting module B can calculate the driver score for the work task. On the other hand in response to determining that the driver is driving for the non work task the onboard driver alerting module B may not calculate the driver score for the non work task.

Moreover in some implementations the onboard driver alerting module B can first transmit an initiation message to the vehicle management system requesting that the driver and the vehicle participate in a program associated with the program instruction. For instance the initiation message can request that the driver and the vehicle participate in a fuel efficiency status tracking program in which a fuel efficiency score for the driver will be compared and monitored relative to fuel efficiency scores for multiple other drivers. The onboard driver alerting module B may receive an acknowledgment message from the vehicle management system indicating that the driver and the vehicle are approved to participate in the program which can subsequently trigger performing the operation at block . In addition the onboard driver alerting module B can receive the program instruction corresponding to the program from the vehicle management system in response to transmitting the initiation message.

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can receive other driver scores from other drivers in a vehicle fleet that includes the vehicle. The other driving scores can be indicative of driving performances of the other drivers in the vehicle fleet and may be calculated in accordance with the same program instruction used to calculate the driver score at block .

At block the onboard driver alerting module B can determine whether the driver is permitted to access the driver scores stored or managed by the onboard driver alerting module B in accordance with multiple access instructions. The onboard driver alerting module B can retrieve the multiple access instructions from the memory and the multiple access instructions can prescribe when the driver of the vehicle is permitted to access information determined according to the multiple program instructions such as for the status tracking program. Moreover the onboard driver alerting module B can make the determination of whether the driver is permitted to access the driver scores in response to a request from the driver to access one or more of the driver scores.

The multiple access instructions can for example indicate that the drivers permitted to access one or more of the driver scores during a first time period but not during a second time period. As one example the first time period can be when the vehicle is not moving and the second time period can be when the vehicle is moving. As another example the first time period can include working hours for the driver and the second time period can include non working hours for the driver. As yet another example the length of the first time period or the second time period can depend on a driving history of the driver such as a value indicative of a level of experience of the driver or an accident record associated with the driver.

At block in response to determining that the driver is permitted to access the driver scores the onboard driver alerting module B can output one or more of the driver scores for presentation to the driver such as audibly or on a display to the driver. Many of the driver scores may be presented together on a display to facilitate comparison between drivers such as in the case of a leaderboard.

At block in response to determining that the driver is not permitted to access the driver scores the onboard driver alerting module B can deny the driver access to the driver scores for example such as by denying a request to access the scores from the driver or output an alert for presentation to the driver indicating that the driver is currently not permitted to access the driver scores. In one implementation dealer can further indicate a reason that the driver is currently not permitted to access the driver scores and the reason can correspond to an access limitation prescribed by the multiple access instructions.

In addition in certain implementations the multiple program instructions or the multiple access instructions can be adjusted such as over time or in response to a command message received from the vehicle management system . For instance the onboard driver alerting module B can receive a command message that indicates to further restrict or increase permitted access such as for certain time periods for the driver.

Although the process is described with respect to vehicle side processing and access control with one of the in vehicle devices processing and access control can be performed or maintained by the vehicle management system additionally or alternatively. For example the vehicle management system may calculate driver scores and deny access to the driver scores or other information related to a program in accordance with the multiple access instructions. The vehicle management system can for instance refuse requests for the driver scores or instead push updates out to one or more of the in vehicle devices with at times when the drivers associated with the one or more of the in vehicle devices may be permitted access to the driver scores.

In one example program multiple of the in vehicle devices can each compete on the basis of which driver achieves the highest miles per gallon while performing their assigned routes. The multiple of the in vehicle devices can each request participation in the program and then download the program instructions for the program. Hourly during the workday the driver alerting module can for instance calculate driver scores and update leaderboards for the program. The drivers can generally update their driver scores as they perform their driving tasks and can access the driver scores during the workday and while their vehicles are not moving. However some of the drivers may have greater limitations on their access to the scores as they are deemed to have a lower level of trust to access the information. Such drivers with greater limitations may be drivers that are newer to a vehicle fleet or have one or more accidents on the record. The access to the driver scores but each of the drivers can moreover vary over time for each of the drivers depending on dynamic conditional customizable or adjustable criteria. At the conclusion of example program one or more of the drivers can be awarded achievements or awards reflecting their successful accomplishments as part of the program.

The in vehicle devices can include computing devices installed in fleet vehicles. These devices can include navigation functionality routing functionality and the like. The in vehicle devices can receive route information and other information from the vehicle management system . In addition the in vehicle devices can report information to the vehicle management system such as driver location vehicle sensor data vehicle status for example maintenance tire pressure or the like and so forth.

The management devices can be computing devices used by dispatchers fleet managers administrators or other users to manage different aspects of the vehicle management system . For example a user of one of the management devices can access the vehicle management system to generate routes dispatch vehicles and drivers and perform other individual vehicle or fleet management functions. With the management devices users can access and monitor vehicle information obtained from one or more of the in vehicle devices by the vehicle management system . Such vehicle status information can include data on vehicle routes used stops speed vehicle feature usage such as power takeoff device usage driver behavior and performance vehicle emissions vehicle maintenance energy usage and the like. In some embodiments the management devices are in fixed locations such as at a dispatch center. The management devices can also be used by administrators in the field and may include mobile devices laptops tablets smartphones personal digital assistants PDAs desktops or the like.

The vehicle management system can be implemented by one or more physical computing devices such as servers. These servers can be physically co located or can be geographically separate for example in different data centers. In one embodiment the vehicle management system is implemented as a cloud computing application. For instance the vehicle management system can be a cloud implemented platform hosted in one or more virtual servers and or physical servers accessible to users over the Internet or other network . In the depicted embodiment the vehicle management system includes a fleet management module a mapping module a telematics module a routing module a dispatch module and an integration module . These components can but need not be integrated together on a common software or hardware platform.

The fleet management module can include functionality for generating rendering or otherwise displaying a vehicle management user interface . The vehicle management user interface can include a map or list of vehicles that depicts symbols or other data representative of vehicles.
