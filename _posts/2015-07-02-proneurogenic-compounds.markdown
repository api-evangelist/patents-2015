This invention was made with government support under Grant Numbers 5DPIOD00027605 5R37MH05938809 and 1RO1MH087986 which were awarded by the National Institute of Health the Government has certain rights in the invention.

This presently disclosed embodiments relate generally to the discovery of pro neurogenic compounds capable of promoting neurogenesis and or reducing neuronal cell death.

It is now accepted that the adult vertebrate brain fosters the birth and functional incorporation of newly formed neurons Goldman and Nottebohm Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1983 80 2390 2394 Paton and Nottebohm Science 1984 225 1046 1048 Burd and Nottebohm J Comp Neurol 1985 240 143 152 . However it was long thought that no new neurons could be added to the adult mammalian brain. This dogma was challenged in the 1960 s when autoradiographic evidence of new neuron formation in the hippocampal dentate gyms olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex of the adult rat was presented Altman J. Science 1962 135 1127 1128 Altman J. J Comp Neurol 1966 128 431 474 Altman Anat Rec 1963 145 573 591 Altman and Das J. Comp. Neurol. 1965 124 319 335 Altman and Das J Comp Neurol 1966 126 337 390 . It is now accepted that within all mammalian species including humans Eriksson et al. Nat. Med. 1998 4 11 1313 1317 there are two major reservoirs of neuronal stem cells one located in the subgranular zone SGZ of the hippocampal dentate gyms and another in the subventricular zone SVZ Gross Natl. Rev. 2000 1 67 72 . Neural stem cells in the SVZ facilitate formation of new neurons that migrate rostrally to populate the olfactory bulb while neural stem cells in the SGZ produce neurons that integrate locally in the granular layer of the dentate gyms a region of the hippocampus that exhibits lifelong structural and functional plasticity.

The process of new neuron formation in the adult mouse brain can be influenced by environmental chemical and genetic variables. As demonstrated by Gage and colleagues neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain is enhanced when animals are exposed to an enriched environment Kempermann et al. Nature 1997 386 493 495 or able to exercise voluntarily van Praag et al. Nat. Neuro sci. 1999 2 266 270 . More recently anti depressant drugs have been shown to enhance levels of adult neurogenesis in animals including humans Schmidt et al. Behav Pharmacol. 2007 September 18 5 6 391 418 Boldrini et al. Neuropsychopharmacology 2009 34 2376 2389 . Among many genes reported to impact adult neurogenesis is the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 NPAS3 a central nervous system CNS specific transcription factor that has been associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Kamnasaran et al. J. Med. Genet. 2003 40 325 332 Pickard et al. Am. J. Med. Genet. B. Neuropsychiatr. Genet. 2005 136B 26 32 Pickard et al. Ann. Med. 2006 38 439 448 Pickard et al. Mol. Psychiatry 2009 14 874 884 Lavedan et al. Pharmacogenomics 2008 9 289 301 . Animals missing both copies of the NPAS3 gene suffer a profound loss of adult hippocampal neurogenesis coupled with significant behavioral deficits Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 . Knowing that impaired post natal neurogenesis elicits unfavorable phenotypic deficits it is predicted that pro neurogenic chemical compounds should exhibit favorable therapeutic benefits.

This presently disclosed embodiments relate generally to compounds that promote the generation or the survival of existing neurons in the mammalian brain. For the purpose of simplicity these compounds are referred to as being pro neurogenic. In certain embodiments the compounds promote the generation or survival of neurons in the post natal mammalian brain. In certain embodiments the compounds promote the survival growth development and or function of neurons particularly CNS brain cerebral and hippocampal neurons. In certain embodiments the compounds stimulate post natal hippocampal neurogenesis which while not wishing to be bound by theory is believed to represent a therapeutic target for a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases including but not limited to schizophrenia major depression bipolar disorder normal aging epilepsy traumatic brain injury post traumatic stress disorder Parkinson s disease Alzheimer s disease Down syndrome spinocerebellar ataxia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Huntington s disease stroke radiation therapy chronic stress abuse of neuro active drugs such as alcohol opiates methamphetamine phencyclidine and cocaine retinal degeneration spinal cord injury and peripheral nerve injury. In certain embodiments the compounds stimulate post natal hypothalamic neurogenesis which can provide therapeutic benefits in weight management such as physiological weight loss associated with various conditions including but not limited to normal aging chemotherapy radiation therapy stress drug abuse anorexia as well as other diseases discussed herein.

The presently disclosed embodiments also feature compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions that include such compounds as well as methods of making identifying and using such compounds. Other features and advantages are described in or will be apparent from the present specification and accompanying drawings.

It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art as generally known that different enantiomers may have different activity. One enantiomer can be more active than another enantiomer. Two enantiomers combined can have another level of activity that is different than either substantially pure enantiomer. Preliminary experiments suggest P7C3 5113 is more active than P7C3 5114 in pro neurogenic and or anti apoptotic activities in an in vivo assay where 12 week old adult male C57 Bl6 mice were treated with 10 M of either compound. It should be noted that such difference in enantiomer activity may also be observed in other compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments. It should also be noted that such activity may depend on assay mode compound concentration compound purity compound stability as well as other parameters. It is possible that when tested at a different concentration a less active enantiomer may show increased activity and vice versa.

In an effort to identify compounds that might stimulate the birth of new neurons or protect newborn neurons from cell death a library of 1 000 compounds was screened using an in vivo assay. In the initial screen compounds were randomly pooled into groups of ten and administered intracerebroventricularly at a constant rate over seven days into the left lateral ventricle of living mice via Alzet osmotic mini pumps. Compounds were administered at a concentration of 10 M for each molecule making a total solute concentration of 100 M. After seven days of infusion at a constant rate of 0.5 L hour a total of 84 L of volume will have left the pump 0.00084 Moles and entered the cerebrospinal fluid. The average volume of a brain from a 12 week old male C57 B6 mouse in our study is 500 mm. The maximal amount of drug was estimated that could potentially be present in the brain taking the extreme and unlikely scenario of 100 absorbance of the drug into brain tissue and 0 clearance throughout the seven day infusion period. Under these conditions at the end of one week of infusion each compound would be present at 1.7 Molar concentration. Since the actual amount of chemical compound in the brain is likely to be only a fraction of this predicted level it is reasonable to estimate that compounds were administered at mid to low nanomolar concentrations.

During compound infusion animals were intraperitoneally IP injected daily with the thymidine analog bromodeoxyuridine BrdU as a means of scoring the birth and survival of proliferating neural precursor cells in the hippocampus. Because both social interaction and voluntary exercise are known to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis mice were housed individually without access to running wheels throughout the screening period. Following the week long period of compound administration animals were perfused and sacrificed. Dissected brain tissue was fixed embedded sectioned stained with antibodies to BrdU and evaluated by light microcopy as a means of quantifying neurogenesis and survival of newborn neural precursor cells localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms on the brain hemisphere contralateral to the side of mini pump cannulation. Every fifth section throughout the entire rostral caudal extent of the hippocampus was analyzed and the total number of BrdU cells was normalized against the measured volume of the dentate gyms. Because both increased proliferation and survival of newborn neurons are important screening parameters the screen was conducted over seven days in order to cast a wide net to detect molecules that might augment either process. The choice of parameters for the screen was based on pulse chase experiments with a single injection of BrdU under identical conditions to those used in our screen which revealed that 40 of newborn cells in the dentate gyms die within the first five days of their birth . Intracranial infusions of either fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF 2 or artificial cerebral spinal fluid aCSF vehicle via the same week long protocol were employed as positive and negative controls. There was no difference in the number of BrdU labeled cells in the dentate gyms between mice subjected to surgical pump implantation and infusion with vehicle and mice having had no surgery . This confirmed the validity of the in vivo approach to assess the ability of intracerebroventricularly infused compounds to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in the contralateral hemisphere.

Considered to be important is that stimulation of neurogenesis triggered by any compound be localized to the exact region of the brain known to produce new neurons at an enhanced level in response to healthy activities such as wheel running access to an enriched environment or access to social interaction. For this reason attention was focused solely on compound pools that stimulated BrdU incorporation only in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyms. Prominent nonspecific incorporation of BrdU in ectopic regions such as CA3 CA1 cortex or striatum was presumed to reflect pathological inflammation as proliferating cells incorporate BrdU in DNA synthesis or to indicate other forms of toxicity as cells also incorporate BrdU during DNA repair. Any compound pools yielding ectopic BrdU incorporation were eliminated from the screen. For an example see .

Each of the 100 pools was tested on two independent mice. As shown in ten of the 100 test pools were observed to enhance dentate gyms specific neurogenesis to an extent roughly equivalent to FGF 2. Each pool that scored positive in the initial two test animals was subsequently re evaluated in two additional mice and all ten pools were found to exert their pro neurogenic effect with statistical significance . In order to identify single pro neurogenic compounds positive pools were broken down into their ten component molecules each of which was infused individually at two concentrations 10 M and 100 M in two mice per concentration. shows the results of break down assays on pool 7 wherein it was discovered that neurogenesis was selectively stimulated by one of the constituent chemicals of the pool compound 3 chemicals in the pool demonstrating no effect. This molecule was designated as Example 45 Compound or P7C3. In breaking down the ten positive pools eight pools yielded a single pro neurogenic compound . To ensure that the pro proliferative or neuroprotective effect on neural stem cells was not an artifact of storage conditions in the UTSWMC chemical compound library re supplied compounds were verified to by 99 pure by mass spectrometry evaluated in 4 mice each at 10 M concentration and shown to retain either pro proliferative or neuroprotective properties in neural stem cells .

Pharmacokinetic analysis of Example 45 Compound in plasma and whole brain tissue was undertaken after single IV IP and oral gavage administrations. Example 45 Compound was noted to be orally bioavailable readily able to cross the blood brain barrier and endowed with a plasma terminal half life of 6.7 hours after IP delivery. These favorable pharmacological properties facilitated a dose response experiment wherein daily oral administration of Example 45 Compound to adult mice was monitored for both brain levels of the chemical and pro neurogenic efficacy . Maximal pro neurogenic efficacy was observed at oral doses of 5 mg kg and above and graded reductions in efficacy were observed at doses of 2.5 and 1 mg kg. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of the brain levels of Example 45 Compound in the dose ranges of 1 2.5 and 5 mg kg revealed corresponding compound concentrations of 213 nM 101 ng g brain tissue 1.13 M 534 ng g brain tissue and 1.35 M 640 ng g brain tissue five hours after dosing.

In order to further study Example 45 Compound an in vivo structure activity relationship SAR study was conducted using 37 chemical derivatives of the compound for pro neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. Compounds were administered for one week at 10 uM into 4 mice per compound along with daily IP injections of BrdU. Following compound administration animals were perfused sacrificed and subjected to sectioning staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. Roughly 10 of the variant compounds retained pro neurogenic activity indistinguishable from the parent compound. An approximately equal number of compounds yielded slightly diminished activity yet the majority of variants were of significantly diminished activity . For example a variant of Example 45 Compound having a methoxy substitution on the aniline ring Example 62 Compound was re tested for pro neurogenic activity via direct administration into the brain of adult mice via Alzet minipumps. The compound was administered for one week at 10 M into 4 mice which were injected daily with BrdU. Following compound administration animals were perfused sacrificed and subjected to sectioning staining and light microscopy in order to monitor hippocampal neurogenesis localized to the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. The methoxy derivative exhibited activity comparable to Example 45 Compound. Subsequently the and enantiomers of Example 62 Compound were prepared . The two enantiomers were evaluated in the in vivo neurogenesis assay. The enantiomer of Example 62 Compound retained potent pro neurogenic activity and the enantiomer displayed diminished activity . Other derivatives have also been resynthesized and retested as described above.

The nature of the cells produced in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyms was investigated when Example 45 Compound was administered as follows. Animals were exposed to oral administration of Example 45 Compound for 30 days. Brain tissue was then prepared for immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to doublecortin DCX a microtubule associated protein that serves as a marker of neurogenesis in the dentate gyms by virtue of transient expression in newly formed neurons but not glial cells between the timing of their birth and final maturation Brown et al. 2003 . As shown in the relative abundance of doublecortin positive neurons increased dramatically as a function of exposure to prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound. Although this observation does not rule out the possibility that the compound might also enhance the formation of glial cells it clearly shows that Example 45 Compound enhanced the formation of cells destined to become neurons.

Example 45 Compound mediated neurogenesis was next investigated to see whether it was attributable to increased cell proliferation or protection of newborn cells from cell death during the time between their birth and eventual incorporation into the granular layer of the dentate gyms. This was accomplished by comparing the ability of Example 45 Compound to enhance either short or long term increases in the incorporation of BrdU in the dentate gyms . Animals exposed to orally delivered Example 45 Compound or vehicle for 30 days were administered a single pulse of BrdU via IP injection. Short term effects on neuron birth were monitored by sacrificing animals one hour post BrdU injection followed by fixation of the tissue sectioning and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU incorporation into cells localized in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. Example 45 Compound administration did not lead to an elevation in the level of BrdU positive cells relative to vehicle in this short term assay. At one day after BrdU administration both groups still showed no statistically significant differences in number of BrdU cells in the dentate gyms. By contrast at the 5 day time point by which time 40 of newborn cells in our assay normally die animals that received Example 45 Compound showed a statistically significant 25 increase in BrdU cells compared to the vehicle only control group. This difference between groups progressed with time such that mice that received a daily oral dose of Example 45 Compound for 30 days starting 24 hours after the pulse treatment of BrdU exhibited a 5 fold increase in the abundance of BrdU positive cells in the dentate gyms relative to vehicle only controls. Notably in this longer term trial BrdU positive cells were observed not only along the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms where new neurons are known to be born but also within the granular layer itself. It is hypothesized that these cells represent mature neurons that have migrated into the granular layer completed the differentiation process and incorporated themselves into the dentate gyms as properly wired neurons. Observations supportive of this interpretation will be presented in a subsequent section of this document. In summary these experiments give evidence that Example 45 Compound enhances the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus and that its mode of action would appear to take place at some point subsequent to their birth.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described cell proliferation tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Example 45 Compound Normalizes Apoptosis and Ameliorates Morphological and Electrophysiological Deficits in the Dentate Gyrus of NPAS3 Deficient Mice 

Mice lacking both copies of the gene encoding neuronal PAS domain protein 3 NPAS3 suffer a profound impairment in adult neurogenesis Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 . By evaluating BrdU incorporation in a short term assay of neurogenesis by sacrificing animals 1 hours after BrdU pulse it was observed that NPAS3 deficient animals have no detectable deficit in the birth of neurons in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms . This is in contrast to our earlier observations of profoundly diminished BrdU labeling in the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient animals when BrdU is administered for a longer period of time 12 days Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 . Knowing that the NPAS3 transcription factor is required for proper expression of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 FGFR1 in the hippocampus Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 it is possible that impediments in growth factor signaling might impair the trophic environment critical for the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms. As an initial test of this hypothesis brain tissue prepared from NPAS3 deficient animals was compared with that of wild type littermates for the presence of cleaved caspase 3 CCSP3 positive cells in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyms. A statistically significant 2 fold increase in CCSP3 positive apoptotic cells was observed in the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient animals . This enhanced rate of programmed cell death is likely to account at least in part for the nearly complete elimination of adult neurogenesis in mice lacking the NPAS3 transcription factor Pieper et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2005 102 14052 14057 .

In addition to this quantitative deficit in adult neurogenesis abnormalities have been observed in both the morphology and electrophysiology of granular neurons of the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient animals. Relative to wild type animals Golgi Cox staining revealed severe attenuation in dendritic branching and spine density of dentate gyms granular neurons of NPAS3 deficient animals . By contrast no genotype dependent differences in these measures were observed in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Equivalently specific deficits were observed by electrophysiologic recordings of NPAS3 deficient animals compared with wild type littermates . Whole field recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials fEPSP revealed significant deficits in NPAS3 deficient animals relative to wild type littermates. In the dentate gyms stimulating and recording electrodes were positioned in the outer molecular layer which is innervated by axons of the perforant pathway originating from the entorhinal cortex. In the CA1 region of the hippocampus stimulation and recording electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum which is innervated by the Schaffer collateral axons of CA3 pyramidal cells. Stimulus intensity was increased in 5 A to increments the slope of the decreasing part of field potentials was measured and fEPSP was quantified relative to the amplitude of the fiber volley which represents firing of action potentials in pre synaptic axons. This analysis revealed aberrant hyper excitability of synaptic transmission in npas3 mice both in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyms and in the CA1 region .

Armed with these genotype and region specific deficits in both neuron morphology and electrophysiological activity whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might favorably repair either deficit in NPAS3 deficient animals was tested. Before embarking on this effort it was first confirmed that Example 45 Compound was capable of enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis in NPAS3 deficient mice by demonstrating that Example 45 Compound enhances both BrdU incorporation as well as expression of doublecortin in newborn neurons in the dentate gyms of npas3 mice . Knowing that formation of the dentate gyms initiates in the late pre natal mouse embryo around embryonic day 14 Stanfield and Cowan 1988 The development of the hippocampal region. In Cerebral Cortex E. G. Jones and A. Peters eds. New York Plenum Press pp. 91 131 animals were exposed to Example 45 Compound for as extended a period of time as possible in order to give the compound the best possible chance for exhibiting favorable effects. Following oral gavage of pregnant female mice 14 day embryos were recovered dissected and processed by acetonitrile water extraction so that Example 45 Compound levels could be measured in the embryonic brain. Daily administration of 20 mg kg of Example 45 Compound to pregnant females yielded appreciable levels of the compound in the brain tissue of developing embryos. It was similarly observed that oral administration of the compound to lactating females led to delivery of Example 45 Compound to the brain tissue of weanling pups. In both cases LC MS based quantitation of Example 45 Compound revealed levels of compound accumulation at or above the 1.35 M limit required to support adult neurogenesis . Finally it was observed that daily IP administration of Example 45 Compound to weaned pups at 20 mg kg was sufficient to yield brain levels of Example 45 Compound at or above the level required to enhance adult neurogenesis.

Female mice heterozygous at the NPAS3 locus were mated to heterozygous males. Two weeks post mating females were given a daily oral gavage of either 20 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only formula. Dosing was continued throughout the last trimester of pregnancy as well as the two week post natal period of lactation. Following weaning pups were given a daily IP dose of either 20 mg kg Example 45 Compound or vehicle control. At about 7 weeks of age mice were switched to oral gavage delivery of the same dose of Example 45 Compound. When mice were 3 months of age they were sacrificed and brain tissue was dissected and subjected to either Golgi Cox staining or electrophysiological recording. As shown in prolonged exposure to Example 45 Compound robustly repaired morphological deficits in the dendritic branching of granular neurons of the dentate gyms in NPAS3 deficient mice. Moreover as shown in the electrophysiological deficit in the dentate gyms of NPAS3 deficient mice was also corrected following prolonged exposure of mice to Example 45 Compound. The corresponding electrophysiological deficit in CA1 region of the hippocampus however was not affected underscoring the specificity of Example 45 Compound to improving functioning of the dentate gyms in this animal model.

It is also notable that relative to vehicle only controls administration of Example 45 Compound did not affect any aspect of the health of mothers embryos weanlings or young adult mice. Gross histology of brain tissue was normal in both compound and vehicle treated animals and there was no evidence of neuronal cell loss or degenerative changes cytoplasmic eosinophilia vacuolization or nuclear pyknosis . The only morphological change other than normalization of dendritic arborization of granular neurons of the dentate gyms was a compound dependent increase in the thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms itself . The thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms is roughly 40 less in NPAS3 deficient animals than wild type littermates. Prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound through late embryonic development early post natal development and two months post weaning significantly corrected this deficit without affecting the thickness of other hippocampal layers in NPAS3 deficient mice .

Recognizing that the reduced thickness of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in NPAS3 deficient animals could be attributed to elevated levels of apoptosis of newborn hippocampal neural precursor cells the effect of Example 45 Compound treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of NPAS3 deficient animals was examined through immunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase 3 CCSP3 . As shown in 12 days of treatment with orally delivered Example 45 Compound 20 mg kg to adult NPAS3 deficient animals significantly reduced CCSP3 staining in the dentate gyms whereas vehicle treatment had not effect. It is thereby proposed that Example 45 Compound facilitated repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in NPAS3 deficient mice by ameliorating a genotype specific exacerbation of programmed cell death.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described apoptosis tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Extensive evidence pioneered by the laboratory of Xiaodong Wang has shown that an intrinsic pathway leading to programmed cell death emanates from mitochondria Liu et al. Cell 1996 86 147 157 Yang et al. Science 1997 275 1129 1132 . With the help of the Wang lab assays were established to test whether Example 45 Compound might protect mitochondria from calcium induced dissolution Distelmaier et al. Cytometry A 2008 73 129 138 . Tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM is a cell permeant cationic red orange fluorescent dye that is readily sequestered by active mitochondria. When loaded with TMRM dye vehicle only treated cells released the dye within 15 minutes of exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187. By contrast dye release was prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 ng of Example 45 Compound . As with in vivo neurogenesis assay as well as the in vitro protection from A mediated toxicity of cultured cortical neurons preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed only with the enantiomer of Example 62 Compound .

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mitochondrial integrity tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

A chemical compound sharing structural similarity to Example 45 Compound is 2 3 4 5 Tetrahydro 2 8 dimethyl 5 2 6 methyl 3 pyridyl ethyl 1H pyrido 4 3 b indole . An anti histamine trade named Dimebon was anecdotally noticed over the decades to ameliorate symptoms of dementia O Brien Lancet Neurol. 2008 7 768 769 Burns and Jacoby Lancet 2008 372 179 180 . More recently an American biotechnology company designated Medivation initiated clinical trials to formally test whether Dimebon might improve the symptoms of patients suffering from Alzheimer s disease. The results of FDA sponsored phase 2 clinical trials in Alzheimer s disease were recently published reporting favorable response rates Doody et al. Lancet 2008 372 207 215 . Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were compared in three functional assays. The in vivo test for effects on hippocampal neurogenesis revealed activity for both compounds with Example 45 Compound exhibiting between 10 and 30 fold higher level of potency and a ceiling of efficacy roughly 40 higher than the anti histamine drug . Dimebon has been implicated in protecting mitochondria Bachurin et al. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2001 939 425 435 Bachurin et al. Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 2003 993 334 344 discussion 345 349 . Therefore Dimebon was compared with Example 45 Compound in the calcium induced mitochondrial dissolution assay. Both compounds were observed to be active and it was again observed that the relative potency of Example 45 Compound was superior to Dimebon . Protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was lost for Example 45 Compound between the 10 and 1 nM doses whereas that of Dimebon was lost between 10 and 1 M.

Example 45 Compound and Dimebon were tested for binding to the H1 histamine receptor. While Dimebon displayed high affinity for this receptor IC5010 M .

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described binding activity tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Next aged Fisher rats were used as a means of performing behavioral tests capable of assessing the potential benefits of Example 45 Compound on hippocampus dependent learning. It is well established that normal rodent aging is associated with attenuation of hippocampal neurogenesis Kuhn et al. J. Neurosci. 1996 16 2027 2033 Driscoll et al. Neuroscience 2006 139 1173 1185 . Reduced neurogenesis in aged rats is likely related to increased neuronal apoptosis in the aged rat brain Martin et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277 34239 34246 Kim et al. Exp. Gerontol. 2010 45 357 365 . These changes have been hypothesized to contribute to cognitive decline as a function of terminal aging.

It was first evaluated whether Example 45 Compound would enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in aged rats as it does in adult mice. Rats were injected with a daily IP dose of either 10 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle coinjected with a daily dose of BrdU and then sacrificed after 7 days for immunohistochemistry. As shown in compound treated animals revealed a 500 increase in BrdU labeling in the dentate gyms relative to vehicle treated controls. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies to doublecortin likewise revealed a robust compound specific enrichment in this marker of newborn neurons. Having observed proneurogenic efficacy of Example 45 Compound in this short term assay it was then tested whether prolonged administration of Example 45 Compound might ameliorate age related decline in cognition by subjecting 18 month old rats to daily administration of either i 0 mg kg of Example 45 Compound or vehicle only for 2 months. Animals of both groups were further subjected to weekly IP administration of BrdU 50 mg kg for later immunohistochemical measurements of hippocampal neurogenesis. As a control both Example 45 Compound and vehicle treated groups were confirmed to display equal ability to physically participate in the task and learn the task as shown by decreased latency times to find the hidden platform over the 5 day training period both before and after 2 months of treatment . Moreover neither swim speed nor locomotor activity varied with age or treatment paradigm.

After 2 months of compound or vehicle administration cognitive ability was assessed blind to treatment group by removing the goal platform. Animals of the Example 45 Compound treated group retained a statistically significant improvement in ability to navigate to the region of the missing platform as evidenced by performance in the probe test. As shown in when the platform was removed from the maze rats treated with Example 45 Compound crossed the precise location previously containing the platform significantly more often than vehicle treated rats. Furthermore Example 45 Compound treated rats spent a higher percentage of time in the general goal area defined as the quadrant previously containing the platform than vehicle treated rats 35.5 2.2 for Example 45 Compound treated 28.1 2.6 for vehicle treated Student s t Test p

After behavioral testing animals were sacrificed for immunohistochemical detection of BrdU and CCSP3. As shown in the dentate gyms of rats exposed to Example 45 Compound showed a 3 fold higher level of BrdU positive neurons than that of the vehicle group. Moreover Example 45 Compound treated animals showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of CCSP3 positive cells relative to vehicle controls . Unexpectedly administration of Example 45 Compound helped rats maintain stable body weight with aging in contrast to vehicle treated rats whose weight declined steadily with age . Example 45 Compound mediated effects on body weight were independent of food intake and treatment of aged rats with Example 45 Compound had no effect on postfasting blood glucose levels . Next it was tested whether Example 45 Compound mediated preservation of body weight in aged rats operates via central or peripheral modes of action.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described in vivo tests in rats or other animal models can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Positioned immediately below the thalamus and forming the floor and lower lateral walls of the third ventricle the hypothalamus consists of multiple groups of cells that regulate the autonomic nervous system and also control motivational behaviors via extensive neuronal connections to the pituitary gland thalamus midbrain and cerebral cortex. These functions include water balance biological rhythms feeding and drinking drive sexual activity pituitary gland function and temperature regulation. Neural stem cells in the adult brain reside in the wall of the third ventricle and proliferate in response to various stimuli and formation of new neurons in the hypothalamus has also been observed in the hypothalamic parenchyma. Administration of trophic factors such as brain derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor enhances neurogenesis in the rodent hypothalamus. Furthermore newborn neurons in the adult hypothalamus integrate into existing hypothalamic neural circuits and express neuronal markers such as POMC phosphorylated signal transducer of activator of transcription neuropeptide Y ocytocin and vasopressin. During hypothalamic development POMC expressing progenitor cells differentiate into two populations of cells with antagonistic roles expressing either POMC or neuropeptide Y that exert opposite effects in regulating energy balance. It is thus proposed that differential regulation of postnatally generated neurons in the hypothalamus might form the basis of developing new treatments to regulate food intake behavior. This hypothesis is supported by observations that acute ablation of new hypothalamic neurons leads to severe anorexia and weight loss.

It was evaluated whether P7C3 might augment hypothalamic neurogenesis by administering either vehicle or P7C3 10 mg kg twice daily i.p. to nine week old male C57BL 6 mice starting two days before implantation of 7 day Alzet osmotic minipumps model 1007d loaded with BrdU 1 mg kg . Pumps were connected to a cannula that delivered BrdU at a constant rate into the left lateral ventricle for the seven day period during which time animals continued to receive either vehicle or P7C3. Pumps were surgically removed at the conclusion of their 7 day operating period and mice were allowed to survive for 4 more weeks during which time they continued to receive either vehicle or P7C3. At the end of the 4 week period mice were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal i.p. injection of mouse anesthetic cocktail and transcardially perfused with 4 paraformaldehyde PFA in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 . Brains were then dissected and post fixed overnight at 4 degrees Celsius in 4 PFA and cryoprotected in 30 sucrose in PBS. Fixed brains were embedded in O.C.T and cut at 20 micrometer thickness with a cryostat. Every third section was immunohistochemically stained for BrdU Accurate rat anti Brdu 1 400 per our standard procedures. Anti rat Dylight 596 was used to visualize BrdU incorporation. As can be seen from treatment with P7C3 markedly enhances hypothalamic neurogenesis in the rodent brain with a significantly increased amount of BrdU positive staining

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described hypothalamic neurogenesis tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Because P7C3 and its derivatives and analogs can enhance hypothalamic neurogenesis compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can be useful for regulating hypothalamic functions such as water balance biological rhythms feeding and drinking drive sexual activity pituitary gland function and temperature regulation. For example given P7C3 s role in maintaining stable body weight in aging rats compounds of the presently disclosed embodiments can provide therapeutic benefits to patients experiencing physiological weight loss for various reasons such as normal aging radiation treatment chemotherapy anorexia cachexia diabetes stress substance abuse dementia stroke cancer infection as well as other diseases and or conditions.

Since P7C3 ameliorates the death of newborn neurons in the dentate gyms in living mice it is possible that its function might relate to mitochondrial integrity. Assays were established to test whether P7C3 might protect cultured U2OS cells from calcium induced mitochondrial dissolution Distelmaier et al. Cytometry A 2008 73 129 138 . Tetramethylrhodamine methylester TMRM dye is sequestered by active mitochondria and when loaded with TMRM vehicle treated cells released the dye within 15 rain of exposure to the calcium ionophor A23187. By contrast dye release was fully prevented in cells exposed to as little as 10 nM of P7C3 . Compounds known to be less active in vivo were also less active in this assay not shown . Preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential in this assay was observed for the R enantiomer of P7C3 OMe Example 1b but not the S enantiomer Example 1a . Finally protection of mitochondrial membrane permeability was observed at an enhanced level for a compound variant P7C3A20 Example 6a which also exhibited a high level of proneurogenic activity . Derivatives that have less proneurogenic activity than P7C3 such as Example 33 and Example 21 displayed less protective effect in preserving mitochondrial integrity at the tested doses in cultured primary cortical neurons.

It was also examined whether Example 45 Compound preserves mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured primary cortical neurons . Cortical neurons cultures from rats on embryonic day 14 were loaded with tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM dye after 6 days of maturation. The top panels no calcium ionophore show that the dye alone did not affect the health of neurons. The remaining panels are from cells that were exposed to the calcium ionophore A23187 at time zero. With vehicle alone cortical neuron mitochondrial membrane potential was rapidly lost after exposure to the ionophore. Escalating doses of Example 45 Compound preserved mitochondrial membrane potential following exposure to the calcium ionophore A23187 in a dose dependent manner with full protection achieved at 1 mM. The less active compound Example 33 was less effective in preserving mitochondrial membrane potential at any dose tested. Results shown are representative of 10 fields analyzed in each of 2 experimental runs for all conditions.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mitochondrial tests can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Recognizing that reduced thickness of the npas3 dentate gyms granular layer could be attributed to increased apoptosis of proliferating neural precursor cells the effect of Example 45 Compound P7C3 treatment on apoptosis in the hippocampus of npas3 mice was examined through immunohistochemical staining of CCSP3. As shown in after 12 days of orally delivered Example 45 Compound 20 mg kg to adult npas3 mice a statistically significant reduction in CCSP3 staining was observed in the dentate gyms. It is thereby proposed that Example 45 Compound facilitates repair of the granular layer of the dentate gyms in npas3 mice by overcoming a genotype specific enhancement in apoptosis.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described mice model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Example 45 Compound P7C3 Provides Therapeutic Benefit in Animal Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ALS 

ALS also known as Lou Gehrig s disease is an adult onset typically between ages 40 70 rapidly progressive and fatal disease caused by selective degeneration of upper cortical layer V within the primary motor cortex and lower spinal cord motor neurons the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. An estimated 5000 people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS every year. This disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body and patients with ALS ultimately lose their ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement. The earliest parts of the body affected in ALS reflect those motor neurons that are damaged first. About 75 of patients experience onset of symptoms in their arms or legs manifested as difficulty with manual dexterity or ambulation while about 25 experience bulbar onset of ALS difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing. A small proportion of patients have respiratory onset of ALS in the form of weakness of the intercostal muscles that support breathing. Regardless of the region of onset muscle weakness and atrophy invariably spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Most patients develop a constellation of symptoms that includes difficulty moving dysphagia difficulty swallowing dysarthria difficulty speaking or forming words and classical manifestations of loss of upper motor neurons muscular spasticity hyperreflexia and overactive gag reflex and lower motor neurons muscular weakness muscle atrophy muscle cramps and fasciculations . Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are usually spared though may be involved in some patients. About 20 of ALS patients also develop frontotemporal lobar dementia FTLD while 30 50 of patients develop subtle cognitive changes that can be observed with detailed neuropsychological testing. Around 15 45 of patients with ALS also experience what is called pseudobulbar affect a form of emotional lability in which patients manifest intermittent bouts of uncontrollable laughter crying or smiling. This symptom domain is thought to be related to degeneration of bulbar upper motor neurons resulting in exaggerated motor expressions of emotion. Although disease progression varies between individuals most patients are eventually unable to stand or walk get in or out of bed on their own or use their hands and arms. Difficulty chewing and swallowing further leads to progressive weight loss and increased risk of choking and aspiration pneumonia. Towards the end stages of disease as the diaphragm and intercostal muscles weaken most patients require ventilator support. Individuals with ALS most commonly die of respiratory failure or pneumonia within 2 5 years of diagnosis.

Ninety five percent of ALS cases occur sporadically SALS with no identifiable cause or family history of the disease. The remaining 5 of cases are inherited known as Familial ALS FALS . Because FALS and SALS are clinically and neuropathologically similar the pathogenesis of these forms of ALS may converge on a common pathogenic pathway. Approximately 20 of FALS and 3 of SALS cases are associated with autosomal dominant mutations in the SOD1 gene on chromosome 21 and about 150 different mutations dispersed throughout this gene have been identified in FALS. SOD1 encodes cytosolic Cu Zn superoxide dismutase an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by converting superoxide a toxic free radical generated through normal metabolic activity of mitochondria to hydrogen peroxide. Unchecked free radicals accumulate and damage both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA as well as proteins within cells. In ALS linked to mutations in SOD1 cytotoxicity of motor neurons appears to result from a gain of toxic SOD1 function rather than from loss of dismutase activity. Although the exact molecular mechanisms underlying toxicity are unclear mutation induced conformational changes in SOD1 are known to lead to misfolding and subsequent cytotoxic aggregation of mutant SOD1 in cell bodies and axons. Aggregate accumulation of mutant SOD1 is thought to disrupt cellular functions and precipitate neuron death by damaging mitochondria proteasomes protein folding chaperones or other proteins.

Transgenic animal models of mutant SOD1 are currently used for research into the pathogenic mechanisms thought to broadly underlie ALS such as G93A SOD1 mutant mice. Mice hemizygous for the G93A SOD1 transgene express 18 2.6 copies of a form of SOD1 found in some patients with FALS a substitution of glycine to alanine at codon 93 . This was the first mutant form of SOD1 to be expressed in mice and is the most widely used and well characterized mouse model of ALS. Superoxide dismutase activity in these mice is left intact such that the pathogenic effect of the mutant transgene appears to be gain of function as is thought to occur in human patients. In these mice death of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and loss of myelinated axons in ventral motor roots leads to paralysis and muscle atrophy. Upper cortical motor neurons in these mice also die as the disease progresses and protein aggregates of mutant SOD1 are found only in diseased tissues with greater amounts being detected during motor neuron degeneration. Around 100 days of age G93A SOD1 mice become paralyzed in one or more limbs with paralysis due to loss of motor neurons from the spinal cord. This paralysis rapidly spreads throughout the body culminating in 50 death when mice are 128.9 9.1 days old.

P7C3 was intraperitoneally administered to female G93A SOD1 transgenic mice using a treatment paradigm of 10 mg kg P7C3 i.p. twice a day compared to vehicle starting at 40 days of age. This treatment scheme was selected based on standard protocols for initial proof of concept screens in these mice. To control for transgene copy number mice are sibling matched between treatment groups as per standard protocol. After initiation of P7C3 or vehicle treatment date of onset of illness is determined by peak weight and initial progression of disease is defined as the day at which mice fall to 10 below their maximum weight. Mice are also assessed daily by a standard determination of neurological severity score with a score of 2 or worse for two consecutive days serving as an additional marker of illness progression. This score is determined blind to treatment group with the scoring system described in the legend for the figure. As shown in P7C3 treatment slows disease progression in G93A SOD1 mice in terms of delaying the time point at which mice drop to 10 below their maximum weight. Treatment with P7C3 also significantly delays the age at which G93A SOD1 mice attain a neurological severity score of 2 another marker of disease progression as shown in . Furthermore P7C3 treatment significantly improved performance in the accelerating rotarod task as the disease progressed in these mice as shown in indicating a slowing of progression of motor impairment in the disease process. This protective effective of P7C3 on motor performance in G93A SOD1 mice is also observed in the ink footprint analysis of walking gait as shown in .

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described ALS model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Parkinson s disease PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra which project to the striatum to control normal movement. Though it is one of the most common nervous system disorders of the elderly the cause of PD remains uncertain. Symptoms early in the disease are movement related including shaking rigidity slowness of movement and difficulty with walking gait. More advanced stages of the disease are typically associated with cognitive and behavioral problems including dementia. The early motor symptoms are partially managed by administration of drugs that enhance dopaminergic signaling. However as the disease progresses and the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra continue to die patients reach a point at which these drugs become ineffective at treating the symptoms and additionally produce the complication of dyskinesia. Effectively preventing the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra would therefore be an ideal treatment approach for patients with PD.

MPTP 1 methyl 4 phenyl 1 2 3 6 tetrahydropyridine is a potent neurotoxin that selectively kills dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of both mice and monkeys causing a clinical picture resembling PD. The MPTP toxicity model can therefore be used to study the death of dopaminergic neurons with the goal of developing new treatments for PD based on neuroprotective strategies found to be effective in these neurons. To determine if P7C3A20 might be neuroprotective in the substantia nigra the well characterized and popular MPTP administration regimen was employed as developed by Tatton and Kish 1997 77 1037 1048 and Jakson Lewis et al. 2007 2 141 151. Here 12 week old wild type male C57BL 6 mice were treated for 3 days with P7C3A20 10 mg kg i.p. twice daily or vehicle and on the fourth day a five day regimen of 30 mg kg day i.p. free base MPTP was initiated. During this five day period of MPTP administration the mice continued to receive P7C3A20 or vehicle. Mice continued to receive the same dose of P7C3A20 or vehicle every day for 21 more days at which point they were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with 4 paraformaldehyde. Brains were post fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde at 4 degrees Celsius overnight and then cryoprotected with 30 sucrose in phosphate buffered saline. Fixed brains were cut at 30 microns with a sliding microtone and every 4th section spaced 120 microns apart was stained with antibodies directed against tyrosine hydroxylase TH Abcam rabbit anti TH 1 2500 . TH positive cells were counted in the substantia nigra area. As shown in treatment with P7C3A20 significantly attenuates MPTP mediated killing of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. These observations suggest that P7C3A20 and related compounds may form the basis of new neuroprotective strategies for preventing or slowing the progression of Parkinson s disease.

It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the above described PD model and other animal model can also be used to test other compounds of presently disclosed embodiments.

Huntington s disease HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by the insidious and progressive development of mood disturbances behavioral changes involuntary choreiform movements ceaseless and complex writhing movements of the limbs and cognitive impairment. HD has a prevalence of about 1 in 10 000 people in the U.S. and is caused by a polyglutamine expansion of greater than 36 repeats in the N terminus of the protein huntingtin Htt . There are currently no treatments that delay the appearance or progression of this disease. HD is pathologically characterized by a dramatic loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebral cortex and therapeutic strategies to protect these neurons from dying might provide new treatment options for patients. The physical symptoms of HD typically have their onset between 35 44 years of age though onset has been reported to occur at times ranging from infancy to old age. The exact way in which HD affects an individual varies and can differ even between members of the same family but symptoms progress predictably in most cases. The earliest symptoms include a general lack of coordination and unsteady gait and as the disease advances uncoordinated and jerky body movements become more apparent. More advanced stages are typically accompanied by an observable decline in mental abilities associated with behavioral and psychiatric problems such as anxiety severe depression blunted affect egocentrism aggression and compulsive behaviors such as alcoholism gambling or hypersexuality. Over time physical abilities are gradually impeded until coordinated movement becomes very difficult and mental abilities generally decline into dementia. Complications such as pneumonia heart disease eating difficulties leading to weight loss and malnutrition and physical injury from falls reduce life expectancy to around twenty years after onset of symptoms. There is no cure for HD and full time care is required in later stages of disease.

Htt is a large cytoplasmic protein that interacts with over 100 other proteins and appears to have multiple biological functions. The behavior of mutated Htt mHtt protein is not completely understood but it is known to be toxic to neurons. Damage mainly occurs in the striatum but in later stages other areas of the brain are also attacked such as the cerebral cortex. As neuronal cell death progresses symptoms associated with the functions of the affected brain areas appear. For example planning and modulating movement are the main functions of the striatum and difficulties with these tasks are frequent initial symptoms of HD. Disease initiation and progression are thought to involve in large part a conformational change in the mHtt protein due to the polyglutamine expansion altered protein protein interactions abnormal protein aggregation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and proteolysis which in turn may lead to transcriptional dysregulation excitotoxicity mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. In addition to a role for a gain of new toxic properties of mHtt in HD pathology there is increasing evidence that loss of wild type Htt function also contributes to pathogenesis. For example an essential role of Htt in mitotic spindle formation and mammalian neurogenesis has recently been identified.

One animal model of HD that can be employed for screening potential therapeutic agents is R6 2 transgenic mice. These mice express a mutant exon 1 of the human huntingtin gene engineered to include an approximately 145 155 CAG repeat expansion. R6 2 mice phenocopy much of the neuropathology striatal and cortical neuron cell death and behavioral manifestations of clinical HD. They display progressive motor and cognitive impairments ubiquitinated nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of mutant Htt weight loss decreased striatal and brain size altered levels of neurotransmitters and their receptors and premature death. They exhibit motor deficits as early as 5 6 weeks of age display overt behavioral abnormalities at 8 9 weeks and typically die between 11 and 13 weeks of age. R6 2 mice also display significantly lower levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis relative to wild type littermates even before onset of symptoms.

In one hypothesis P7C3 and its derivates may enhance the formation of neurons in the mature hippocampus by preventing death rather than promoting proliferation of these cells. As such P7C3 is proneurogenic by virtue of its neuroprotective activity. It is also possible that P7C3 and its derivates prevents cell death and promotes cell proliferation. It was evaluated whether P7C3 might provide therapeutic benefit in R6 2 mice. P7C3 10 mg kg i.p. twice daily starting at 6 weeks of age or vehicle were administered to 40 female R6 2 mice. As shown in 50 of vehicle treated R6 2 mice die at approximately 15 weeks of age and treatment with P7C3 delays animal death by about three weeks. At 14 weeks of age R6 2 mice treated with P7C3 showed improved general condition score and appearance as shown in as compared to vehicle treated littermates. General condition score was determined by a 3 point scoring system that was conducted blind to genotype and treatment group score of 0 fur looks groomed normal posture no hunch clear eyes alert score of 1 fur beginning to stick up slight hunch score of 2 piloerection fur sticking up unkempt fur hunch in back or neck area crusty eyes . Death was monitored twice daily and defined as either when animals were found dead or when they were unable to right themselves after being placed on their backs with movement subsequently initiated by gentle prodding for 30 seconds. By general appearance of coat condition grooming and spontaneous activity in the home cage R6 2 mice treated with P7C3 also appear qualitatively better than VEH treated R6 2 mutant mice not shown .

Examples include CH CH O CH CH CH NH CH CH CH N CH CH CH S CH CH CH CH S O CH CH CH S O CH CH CH O CH Si CH CH CH N OCH and CH CH N CH3 CH. Up to two heteroatoms may be consecutive such as for example CH NH OCHand CH O Si CH .

Similarly the term heteroalkylene by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl as exemplified by CH CH S CH CH and CH S CH CH NH CH . For heteroalkylene groups heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini e.g. alkyleneoxy alkylenedioxy alkyleneamino alkylenediamino and the like . Still further for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups no orientation of the linking group is implied.

The terms cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl by themselves or in combination with other terms represent unless otherwise stated cyclic versions of alkyl and heteroalkyl respectively. Accordingly a cycloalkyl group has the number of carbon atoms designated i.e. C3 C8 means three to eight carbons and may also have one or two double bonds. A heterocycloalkyl group consists of the number of carbon atoms designated and from one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O N Si and S and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. Additionally for heterocycloalkyl a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopentyl cyclohexyl 1 cyclohexenyl 3 cyclohexenyl cycloheptyl and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include 1 1 2 5 6 tetrahydropyrid yl 1 piperidinyl 2 piperidinyl 3 piperidinyl 4 morpholinyl 3 morpholinyl tetrahydrofuran 2 yl tetrahydrofuran 3 yl tetrahydrothien 2 yl tetrahydrothien 3 yl 1 piperazinyl 2 piperazinyl and the like.

The terms halo and halogen by themselves or as part of another substituent mean unless otherwise stated a fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine atom. Additionally terms such as haloalkyl are meant to include alkyl substituted with halogen atoms which can be the same or different in a number ranging from one to 2m 1 where m is the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group. For example the term halo C1 C4 alkyl is mean to include trifluoromethyl 2 2 2 trifluoroethyl 4 chlorobutyl 3 bromopropyl and the like. Thus the term haloalkyl includes monohaloalkyl alkyl substituted with one halogen atom and polyhaloalkyl alkyl substituted with halogen atoms in a number ranging from two to 2m 1 halogen atoms where m is the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group . The term perhaloalkyl means unless otherwise stated alkyl substituted with 2m 1 halogen atoms where m is the total number of carbon atoms in the alkyl group. For example the term perhalo C1 C4 alkyl is meant to include trifluoromethyl pentachloroethyl 1 1 1 trifluoro 2 bromo 2 chloroethyl and the like.

The term acyl refers to those groups derived from an organic acid by removal of the hydroxy portion of the acid. Accordingly acyl is meant to include for example acetyl propionyl butyryl decanoyl pivaloyl benzoyl and the like.

The term aryl means unless otherwise stated a polyunsaturated typically aromatic hydrocarbon substituent which can be a single ring or multiple rings up to three rings which are fused together or linked covalently. Non limiting examples of aryl groups include phenyl 1 naphthyl 2 naphthyl 4 biphenyl and 1 2 3 4 tetrahydronaphthalene.

The term heteroaryl refers to aryl groups or rings that contain from zero to four heteroatoms selected from N O and S wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. Non limiting examples of heteroaryl groups include 1 pyrrolyl 2 pyrrolyl 3 pyrrolyl 3 pyrazolyl 2 imidazolyl 4 imidazolyl pyrazinyl 2 oxazolyl 4 oxazolyl 2 phenyl 4 oxazolyl 5 oxazolyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 isoxazolyl 5 isoxazolyl 2 thiazolyl 4 thiazolyl 5 thiazolyl 2 furyl 3 furyl 2 thienyl 3 thienyl 2 pyridyl 3 pyridyl 4 pyridyl 2 pyrimidyl 4 pyrimidyl 5 benzothiazolyl purinyl 2 benzimidazolyl 5 indolyl 1 isoquinolyl 5 isoquinolyl 2 quinoxalinyl 5 quinoxalinyl 3 quinolyl and 6 quinolyl.

For brevity the term aryl when used in combination with other terms e.g. aryloxy arylthioxy arylalkyl includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus the term arylalkyl is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group e.g. benzyl phenethyl pyridylmethyl and the like including those alkyl groups in which a carbon atom e.g. a methylene group has been replaced by for example an oxygen atom e.g. phenoxymethyl 2 pyridyloxymethyl 3 1 naphthyloxy propyl and the like .

Each of the above terms e.g. alkyl heteroalkyl aryl and heteroaryl is meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below.

Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals as well as those groups referred to as alkylene alkenyl heteroalkylene heteroalkenyl alkynyl cycloalkyl heterocycloalkyl cycloalkenyl and heterocycloalkenyl can be a variety of groups selected from OR O NR N OR NR R SR halogen SiR R R OC O R C O R COR CONR R OC O NR R NR C O R NR C O NR R NR SONR NR COR NH C NH NH NR C NH NH NH C NH NR S O R SOR SONR R NR SOR CN and NO in a number ranging from zero to three with those groups having zero one or two substituents being particularly preferred. R R and R each independently refer to hydrogen unsubstituted C1 C8 alkyl and heteroalkyl unsubstituted aryl aryl substituted with one to three halogens unsubstituted alkyl alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups or aryl C1 C4 alkyl groups. When R and R are attached to the same nitrogen atom they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5 6 or 7 membered ring. For example NR R is meant to include 1 pyrrolidinyl and 4 morpholinyl. Typically an alkyl or heteroalkyl group will have from zero to three substituents with those groups having two or fewer substituents being preferred in the presently disclosed embodiments. More preferably an alkyl or heteroalkyl radical will be unsubstituted or monosubstituted. Most preferably an alkyl or heteroalkyl radical will be unsubstituted. From the above discussion of substituents one of skill in the art will understand that the term alkyl is meant to include groups such as trihaloalkyl e.g. CFand CHCF .

Preferred substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals are selected from OR O NR R SR halogen SiR R R OC O R C O R COR CONR R OC O NR R NR C O R NR COR NR SONR R S O R SO2R SONR R NR SOR CN and NO where R and R are as defined above.

When the aryl group is 1 2 3 4 tetrahydronaphthalene it may be substituted with a substituted or unsubstituted C3 C7 spirocycloalkyl group. The C3 C7 spirocycloalkyl group may be substituted in the same manner as defined herein for cycloalkyl . Typically an aryl or heteroaryl group will have from zero to three substituents with those groups having two or fewer substituents being preferred in the presently disclosed embodiments. In one embodiment an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted or monosubstituted. In another embodiment an aryl or heteroaryl group will be unsubstituted.
