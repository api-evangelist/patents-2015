title: Lightweight universal gap crossing device and method of use
abstract: A crossing device aids in crossing from a near side to a far side of an obstacle. It comprises a lead assembly that is projected to the far side of the obstacle and that includes an anchor assembly and a pulley. The anchor assembly has a base, a launch tube that is secured to the base, a spike that is housed within the launch tube, and a propellant charge. The anchor assembly is anchored on the far side of the obstacle by remotely initiating the propellant charge. The explosion force drives the spike through the launch tube and the base, into a landing surface. A bridge is connected to the pulley and is pulled to span across the obstacle. The bridge, lead assembly, and anchor may be collected on the far side for additional uses.

This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 61 981 930 filed on Apr. 21 2014 which is herewith and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

The present invention relates in general to the field of ground unit tactical movement. Specifically this invention relates to a collapsible foldable and portable bridge or ladder for mobile use to aid in crossing generally horizontal obstacles or gaps in urban and rural terrains and in improving security and safety.

Soldiers in a small group of four or more people who are operating in a combat environment might find the need to remain mobile while carrying various loads including their gear and weapons. It is foreseeable that during their operation the soldiers will encounter horizontal obstacles such as canals rooftop to rooftop gaps or minefields that require a crossing device to assist them in avoiding the obstacles.

Crossing devices of various designs have been proposed. The following publications illustrate exemplary designs for crossing devices and associated auxiliaries. U.S. Pat. No. 6 062 621 generally describes a collapsible grappling hook that has a hook on the end. It is spring loaded and opens when thrown. When the grappling hook is thrown it springs open and locks in place.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 062 811 generally describes a collapsible bridge that uses two triangle supports with two rails to provide the main structure over the gap. The rails are then overlaid with transverse girders that lock into place. The supports on the side and the girder rail system are collapsible. The girders are also stackable and the track is foldable.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 904 025 generally describes a method to reinforce a 90 degree intersection in a structural frame. Four triangular cross section beams come together to form a shear resisting member of the frame structure. The intersection is formed by cutting and folding the three faces of each beam to increase surface area in contact with the other beam.

In general the tactical advantages of quick gap crossing outlines two types of crossing hasty and deliberate. There are nine subtasks possible to successfully cross a gap Plan Reconnoiter Prepare Deploy Assets Prepare Assault Site Secure Far Shore Provide Crossing Cross Force and Reconstitute. These steps are detailed and explained. Communication standards are recorded for recon purposes and methods of recon are also detailed. Command and control for offensive and retrograde operations are described.

This article applies to our work because our function is to perform hasty crossings. Our product will be involved in the steps from prepare to reconstitute. Also this article outlines certain features to profile the gap to be crossed such as condition of access egress points location and condition of existing crossing sites reinforced obstacles bank height slope and soil stability which could influence the deployment of our device. Methods of reconnaissance may prove useful.

The report by Hornbeck et al. Trilateral Design and EST Code for Military Bridging and Gap crossing Equipment May 2005 available at http www.dtic.mil dtic tr fulltext u2 a476390.pdf generally describes the building code for the United States Military Bridging and Gap Crossing Equipment. It discusses necessary material parameters load parameters size requirements and safety parameters. It also discusses the United States Military system for rating bridges by Military Load Class. It discusses the necessary parameters of a military footbridge as well as commonly used materials.

Commercial ladders are also available such as the three way extension ladder found online at http www.ladder guy.com ladders and the Xtend and Climb telescoping ladder found online at http besttelescopingladder.com xtend climb 785p aluminum telescoping ladder type i professional series.php.

While the foregoing conventional crossing devices provided a certain level of utility there still remains an opportunity to provide a new gap crossing device that provides optimal features in term of portability stackability compactness light weight extension span rapid deployment reusability durability and ability to reliably support the weight of the soldiers their gears and their weapons e.g. approximately 350 pounds . The new gap crossing device should be amenable for use in military and civilian applications.

The present invention addresses the foregoing concerns and presents a new collapsible foldable flexible cost effective portable gap crossing device also referred to herein as a bridge or a ladder for mobile use to aid in crossing generally horizontal obstacles in urban and rural terrains and in improving security and safely. The gap crossing device is lightweight small in volume and is capable of supporting a load of approximately 350 pounds.

More specifically the gap crossing device is sufficiently compact and light to be readily portable during small team dismounted movements. Due to the variable and rugged environments in which soldiers are traveling the gap crossing device is designed to be durable. Also due to the security concerns associated with crossing linear danger areas the gap crossing device is further designed to be rapidly deployable to help reduce security concerns by making linear danger areas crossings as fast as possible.

In a preferred embodiment the gap crossing device can have a span of approximately twenty feet. It is also able to cover a completely flat obstacle or slightly banked obstacle with a height variation of approximately ten feet. It weighs between approximately five pounds and twenty pounds and occupies a volume between approximately one cubic foot and five cubic feet.

The gap crossing device uses a unique anchoring mechanism. Its method of use can be separated into three distinct phases anchoring employment and redeployment. The anchoring phase relies on both near and far side placement. However one of the benefits of the gap crossing device is it allows natural surroundings to be utilized. The near side anchoring can be based off mobile spikes emplaced by the user or it can use natural anchoring points such as columns or trees. The far side emplacement can also be flexible. The gap crossing device can employ a hand thrown system that will drive a far side anchor point into the material. It uses a propellant to drive the anchoring point namely a spike into the target material.

The anchor spike will allow for penetration into a range of material in which the pullout strength will remain relatively consistent based on the penetration depth. The penetration depth increases in softer materials and decreases in harder materials. The harder materials will have higher pullout strength per unit length allowing sufficient pullout strength regardless of material.

However even the far side anchoring mechanism can be adaptable to the surroundings. For example the anchoring mechanism can be manually emplaced. The far side anchoring mechanism uses a pulley effect based off a loop in the lead wire connected to the anchor. Once the anchoring phase is complete the employment phase commences.

The employment phase of the gap crossing device uses the flexible bridge design to carry the load across the gap. The bridge design uses parallel rungs placed equidistant apart against connecting steel wire in order the bear the point loads. It is pulled across a loop in the lead wire. It is then clamped against itself in order to create tension in the bridge.

In a preferred embodiment the gap crossing device uses a standard ratchet strap on the near side. This allows the flexible body to become tensioned against both the near and far side anchors. The near side will utilize either a wide based column support or employ spaced anchoring points. The far side of the flexible body uses modifiable horizontal spreaders that reduce twisting along the longitudinal axis in the latter half of the bridge. The tension in the bridge also minimizes lateral motion and allows unburdened personnel to cross on their feet rather than crawling. After the personnel have crossed the bridge can either remain as a permanent fixture or redeploy.

The redeployment phase salvages the bulk of the gap crossing device and allows for the system to reengage at a different location if necessary. The redeployment phase uses a clasp device that releases the tension in the flexible bridge. This allows the body to be pulled in and used again. The clasp uses a torsion spring to maintain the tension within the system. After all personnel have crossed the torsion spring can be disengaged remotely from the far side releasing the gap crossing device. The anchor emplacements will be consumable but the bulk of the weight of the gap crossing device can be used in future missions.

Similar numerals refer to similar elements in the drawings. It should be understood that the sizes of the different components in the figures are not necessarily in exact proportion or to scale and are shown for visual clarity and for the purpose of explanation.

With reference to it illustrates a new gap crossing device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The gap crossing device presents numerous features and advantages amongst which are the following portability stackability compactness light weight long extension span rapid deployment reusability durability ability to reliably support the weight of the soldiers their gears and their weapons e.g. ability to support a load of approximately 350 pounds . The new gap crossing device is amenable for use in military and civilian applications such as law enforcement fire departments emergency relief agencies humanitarian aid and rescue operations back country hiking and mountaineering and other similar activities.

The gap crossing device generally includes four main components a lead assembly a cable a bridge also referred to herein as ladder and a nearside anchor assembly .

With further reference to the lead assembly is the component that is thrown as a projectile from a near side of an obstacle such as a river to the far side of the obstacle . The lead assembly generally includes a far side anchor assembly a wire pulley tether and a pulley . The far side anchor assembly includes a steel base an aluminum topper launch tube a far side spike a pack of propellant a remote actuation device and a plastic cap .

Upon assembly the plastic cap is glued to the aluminum topper in order to allow the propellant pack e.g. packed powder charge to eject the plastic cap that cannot withstand the force of the blast while introducing the far side spike or anchor into the far side surface. The propellant based spike uses geometry and a low center of gravity to land upright when thrown. The propellant is then actuated using for example command wire actuation to cause the far side spike to be driven into the ground. The far side spike penetrates multiple different materials from wood to soil and can hold for example a load of approximately 350 pounds. Through testing it has been determined that the pullout force required to remove the far side spike from wood exceeds the force required to hold the flexible bridge while being crossed validating the design.

The aluminum topper screws into place in the steel base by means of one or more screws not shown . The purpose of the heavy steel base is to orient and land the far side anchor assembly in the proper position when the gap crossing device including the pulley is thrown to the far side of the obstacle .

The propellant pack is stored between the plastic cap and a head of the far side spike providing an upward force on the cap and a downward force on the far side spike when blown. Due to restrictions upon availability of the propellants gunpowder is a viable choice for the solid propellant pack . A preferred propellant is a smokeless shotgun powder due to its rapid burn rate.

The remote actuation device may be housed for example within an internal chamber of the cap . The remote actuation device enables a user e.g. a soldier to remotely initiate the propellant pack from the near side of the obstacle .

The wire pulley tether is secured at one end to a neck of the far side spike . The wire pulley tether is crimped to make a loop that is smaller than the head of the for side spike in order to be tightly secured to its neck . The wire pulley tether extends through an opening formed in the bottom of the steel base to connect to the pulley . The pulley provides connection to the cable . An alternative to the use of the pulley is a plain loop at the terminal end of the wire tether .

As further illustrated in the cable connects the lead assembly to the bridge . The bridge is initially on the near side of the obstacle and will need to be extended toward the lead assembly that was previously anchored on the far side of the obstacle in order to breach the gap between the near side and the far side.

In use the cable is looped through the pulley halfway. Once the lead assembly including the pulley is thrown to the far side of the obstacle the bridge end and the tie end of the cable remain on the near side completing the anchoring phase as illustrated in .

With further reference to the employment phase starts with the user applying a pulling force to one of the cable ends such as the tie end which in turn pulls the bridge end of the cable toward the far side. Since the bridge end of the cable is tied to one end of the bridge the pulling force also drags the bridge toward the far side. Once the bridge is extended to the desired length across the obstacle or gap the tie end of the cable is tied down on the near side for support.

One or more near side spikes which form part of the near side anchor assembly are then stabilized in the near side surface ground or available elements found in the environment e.g. a tree trunk . In a preferred embodiment the near side spikes are stabilized by applying a downward force to the spikes which secures the near side end of the bridge . The near side spikes are able to hold the bridge in tension while a load is applied at mid span normal to the walking surface.

With reference to the near side anchor assembly may further include a commercially available tensioning mechanism. One proposed design incorporates a tensioning ratchet strap and a redeployment clasp which attach to the end of the steel wire that spans the bridge using loops in the wire . The tensioning mechanism can be attached at any rung of the bridge before use or during use if necessary and then either detached after use or stored still connected to the bridge . The bridge tends to sag if not fully tensioned. Proper tension in the wire allows for a more easily traversable bridge .

During the employment phase of the tensioning ratchet strap and the redeployment clasp remain at the near side of the obstacle . It should also be noted that the deployed bridge could be locked at any desired length depending on the width of the obstacle .

The redeployment phase is illustrated in . The tensioning ratchet strap is used to reduce lateral instability and cable sage. The redeployment clasp is used to release the tension on the cable and the bridge in order to enable the complete redeployment of the bridge from the far side of the obstacle to the near side. The redeployment clasp can be remotely activated from the near side of the obstacle .

With further reference to the bridge is constructed of a plurality of strong rungs that support the intended loads and of two cable sides that provide stability to the rungs . In one design the flexible bridge spans a horizontal obstacle of approximately 20 feet. The flexible bridge is approximately 25 feet long and weighs approximately 14 pounds. It is primarily composed of two th inch wire side ropes and twenty aluminum rings .

Each rung is preferably hollow and cylindrically shaped with each end including two diametrically opposed holes for securing the rungs to the side ropes or cables . The side ropes are preferably made of steel.

The near side of the bridge is secured to a ratchet strap for tensioning the bridge and a clasp for redeployment. The far side of the bridge can utilize a trapezoidally shaped aluminum pipe and wire rope to stabilize the bridge and counteract twist.

As it has become clear from the foregoing description one of the main benefits of the gap crossing device is that the hand thrown lead assembly replaces the need for a soldier to leave the security of the rest of the unit and expose himself or herself to hazards while navigating the obstacle unaided to secure the far side. Additionally the gap crossing device does not rely on a tree or other environmental structures to secure the bridge to the far side of the obstacle making it usable in versatile environments not merely wooded areas.

The topper includes a hollow launch chamber that extends along the length of the topper to provide a launch path to the far side spike . The launch chamber is open at it upper end and its bottom end . The upper end allows the entry of the far side spike to the launch chamber while the bottom end enables its exit through an opening at the bottom of the base .

While the topper has been described earlier as being composed of aluminum it should be understood that the topper might be made of a different material including but not limited to high strength plastic. Alternatively the topper might be made of light weight material with the launch chamber diameter accommodating a metallic conduit .

While the launch chamber can be axially disposed relative to the topper or launch tube illustrates an alternative embodiment wherein the launch chamber is disposed at an angle relative to the central axis of the topper . In this alternative design the far side spike will travel along the slanted launch chamber to reach the far side surface at an angle allowing for a higher pullout force. A higher pullout force allows more tension in the system and therefore more weight to be supported.

The design of the anchor assembly uses the moment and center of gravity principles to enable the anchor assembly to land in the desired vertical or slanted position so that far side spike is propelled with optimal penetration force. The difference in densities between the parts of the anchor assembly and the dimensions of the steel base shift its center of gravity very close to the bottom of the base allowing the anchor assembly to upright itself.

Considering now the various designs of the far side spike with respect to is a side view of a first preferred embodiment of the far side anchor or spike that forms part of the anchor assembly . The far side spike is preferably made of tungsten though other suitable material may alternatively be used.

The far side spike generally includes the head the neck and a body . The body is formed of a forward or nose section and a main section . Both sections are generally conically shaped so the diameter change at the interface between these two sections creates a lip . The lip has a sufficient circumferential surface area to increase the pressure surface area with the penetrated ground or surface in order to increase the pullout force.

The neck of the far side spike includes a through opening to engage the tether cable loop . The largest diameter of the far end spike fits precisely within the launch tube in the topper . The openings and surfaces of the far end spike are cut or drilled to within ten thousandths of an inch.

The main body or shaft has an X shaped cross sectional area in order to increase the surface area contacting the surface material therefore increasing friction holding the spike in place. A slight twist is added to the cross section to allow for an increase in pullout. The nose allows for a sharp surface area which allows for increased fluid pressure to increase the penetration velocity and pullout strength.

With reference to they illustrate a topper or launch tube that may be used in the anchor assemblies and of . The topper is modified to accommodate the tether cable to the far end spike this end the topper is formed with a hollow launch chamber that is generally cylindrically shaped with a substantially circular cross section. In this specific embodiment the hollow launch chamber has been modified to include a smaller channel along its length through which the tether cable is run. The main function of the channel is to allow room for the tether cable which is attached to the spike.

A ballistics test analysis of the gap crossing device was undertaken including testing at ranges that provided data used to determine the ballistics characteristics of the propellant drive far end spike . At these ranges the spike penetration thickness spike penetration angle free recoil displacement charge size and muzzle velocity were measured through different means.

The Demarre equation was used to determine impact velocity. The standard form of the Demarre equation is utilized to predict armor penetration thickness as follows 

The Demarre coefficient is used to relate hardness of materials in order to use this equation. The range of the Demarre coefficients are generally not found for materials other than steel and armor materials so an estimation of the Demarre coefficient was made. The value of steel was reduced by an order of magnitude of 10 resulting in a value of 1 10. The impact velocity was then check with high speed camera footage in order to determine validity of the measurement. The estimated and measured values varied 10 ft s and a percent difference of 6.67 .

Newton s second law was also used to determine the maximum barrel stress along the radial and longitudinal axes.

Based on this and other analyses the gap crossing device is provided with a four part construction as described earlier. The heavier base will be constructed of 1045 steel. The topper will be constructed of aluminum with a plastic cap that is made for example with a 3D printer. The cap is retained in place with screw threads and designed to detach upon detonation. The topper may be made of plastic material and houses a steel barrel or conduit . The anchor assembly attaches to a pulley or a pulley system . In turn the pulley is connected to the bridge by means of a strong steel leader or tether cable that loops around the far end spike . Prior to the initiation of the propellant pack the far end spike is house within the launch chamber .

The far end spike can be designed to penetrate concrete by constructing it of 1045 steel. The rungs stretching across the bridge are preferably constructed of lightweight PVC a composite or aluminum depending on testing performance.

The anchor assembly including the propellant pack are capable of creating a spike muzzle velocity that is sufficient to penetrate concrete. Achieving an adequate penetrative depth is imperative for ensuring a reliable anchor support that is capable of bearing the required minimum 350 pounds force. In order to accomplish this the powder charge of the propellant pack is capable of producing a 150 m s muzzle velocity with the assumption that the compressive strength of concrete is 30 MPa which is a relatively high magnitude for typical man made structures.

First the energy of the far end spike immediately following the actuation was calculated using the following equation 

where m is the mass of the far end spike and v is its velocity. With a mass of 0.15 kilograms the spike can obtain 1244.64 foot pounds of energy. Using this value for the spike energy the penetration depth in concrete was solved using the equation 

where m and b are dimensionless values derived from a linear equation. Ecp is the spike energy fc is the compressive strength of concrete and d is the spike diameter. Assuming CRH 3.0 then m 0.0941 and b 4.129. This equation asserts that a 1045CR steel spike can achieve a depth penetration of 5.28 inches which is enough to bear the load and allow adequate tension of the entire bridging system. This depth ensures that as long as the reactionary forces do not cause the anchor assembly to be ejected upward the penetration of the far end spike in concrete will be adequate to support the required load.

An analysis of the rungs was also undertaken. The load imparted by the soldier s foot onto the rung of the bridge is modeled as a point load. This is a conservative assumption because it increases the shear and moment caused by the load.

The analysis of the rungs included testing each rung separately for failure by attaching each end of the test specimen to a looped cable pinned to the test apparatus. This essentially created a pin roller support to test for ultimate strength in bending. Increasing incremental loads were added to the rung until a final load exceeding approximately 350 pounds applied centrally was verified. Each specimen was tested at a length of 16 inches. This also introduced a factor of safety when the length is shortened to 15 inches.

An iterative code was then generated that took account of the maximum deflection maximum shear and bending failure. The code checked these three modes of failure against a set outer diameter of aluminum and returned the thinnest rung thickness that would not fail under these constraints. Each test also output an estimated volume and weight so that the outer diameter could be adjusted by the programmer to optimize these factors.

The following three equations were used to check the properties of geometry and material strength versus maximum allowable deflection shear failure and failure in bending respectively.

The spreaders are generally similar in design and function and therefore only one spreader will be described in more detail. The spreader is preferably made of the same material as the rungs including the forward rung . As an example the spreader may be made of an aluminum pipe with the same gauge as that of the rungs . The spreader is secured to one end of the forward rung by means of a larger gauge elbow that fits snuggly onto the end of the forward rung . Similarly the spreader is secured to the opposite end of the forward rung by means of an elbow which is similar in design and construction to the elbow .

Upon assembly the two spreaders branch out into a Y shaped configuration to provide a wider support area to the bridge and thus improve its stability against twisting. The tips or forward ends of the two spreaders are tensioned and kept in the Y shaped configuration by means of the wire . In this regard the wire spans across the open Y shaped configuration of the two spreaders and is secured in this position by any known or available method. As an example a clasp may be added to connect the two end of the wire between the spreaders . In addition the wire may be run entirely through the rungs .

When it is desired to stow the bridge the ends of the wire are released and the tension on the two spreaders is relaxed allowing them to collapse and to be tucked alongside the rungs in a backpack or another storage container.
