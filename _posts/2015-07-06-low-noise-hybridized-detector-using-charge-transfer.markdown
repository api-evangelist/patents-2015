This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62 032 918 filed Aug. 4 2014 for LOW NOISE HYBRIDIZED DETECTOR USING CHARGE TRANSFER by P. Dixon and N. Masaun.

This invention was made with government support under Contract No. N00014 12 C 0375 awarded by Office of Naval Research. The government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention generally relates to a device for detecting radiation in the near infrared IR spectrum. In particular the invention relates to a low noise IR detector that operates by transferring charge rather than by charging and resetting a capacitor through which voltage is read.

Modern infrared IR imaging systems can be focal plane arrays of detectors and associated integrated circuitry in each pixel that transforms the collected signals into visual or other analyzable forms. Near IR detector systems that operate in the 1 to 1.7 m wavelength region are sometimes combined with visible detection systems that operate in the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range to enhance detection and visualization in low light and early night scenarios. Combined visible and near IR imaging capability is increasingly becoming a strategic requirement for both commercial and military applications. Of the many materials used for imaging systems that operate in the near infrared e.g. HgCdTe Ge InSb PtSi etc. InGaAs p i n photodiodes have been chosen due to their high performance and reliability G. Olsen et al. A 128 128 InGaAs detector array for 1.0 1.7 microns in Proceedings SPIE Vol. 1341 1990 pp. 432 437 .

Short wavelength infrared SWIR imaging arrays are normally hybrid devices where the photodiodes are interconnected to silicon transistor read out integrated circuitry ROIC . In one effort to decrease cost and simplify complex manufacturing an InGaAs InP photodiode has been integrated with an InP junction field effect transistor JFET as a switching element for each pixel as described by U.S. Pat. No. 6 005 266 Forrest et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . The combination of photodiode and FET on a single substrate enabled the formation of fully monolithic near IR focal plane arrays with reduced production cost and increased performance. The InP junction field effect transistors exhibited leakage currents as low as 2 pA. In related work intentional doping of the absorption layer of a GaAs p i n photodiode was found to reduce the dark current as described by U.S. Pat. No. 6 573 581 Sugg. et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety .

In previous detectors light induced charge is collected in a single area that is then transferred to an external capacitor where the voltage on the capacitor is measured. The capacitor is then reset before the next measurement. Since it is difficult to completely reset a capacitor in a finite amount of time and the collection area may be collecting charge during the reading operation itself opportunities exist for variation in the amount of signal read.

An infrared photodetector includes a small bandgap layer of first conductivity type a large bandgap layer of first conductivity type overlaying the small bandgap layer a collection well of second conductivity type in the large bandgap layer and in contact with the small bandgap layer so that the small bandgap layer and the collection well form an infrared photodiode a standoff layer over a portion of the large bandgap layer a transfer well of second conductivity type in the standoff layer and the large bandgap layer and spaced from the collection well and the small bandgap layer and a transistor that includes the collection well the transfer well and a region between the collection well and the transfer well.

In another embodiment an infrared photodetector includes a small bandgap layer of a first conductivity type a large bandgap layer of a first conductivity type on the small bandgap layer and a second small bandgap layer on a portion of the second large bandgap layer. A transfer well of a second conductivity type is located in the second small bandgap layer and large bandgap layer. The transfer well is separated laterally from the collection well and vertically from the first small bandgap layer. Electrodes are positioned to cause charge transfer from the collection well to the transfer well.

In a further embodiment a method of forming an infrared photodetector includes depositing a large bandgap layer of a first conductivity type on a small bandgap layer of a first conductivity type and forming a standoff layer on a portion of the large bandgap layer. In a single diffusion step a collection well of a second conductivity type is formed in large bandgap layer and the first small bandgap layer and a transfer well of a second conductivity type is formed in the standoff layer and the large bandgap layer. The transfer is spaced laterally from the collection well and vertically from the first small bandgap layer. Electrodes on the small bandgap layer are formed to allow charge transfer from the collection well to the transfer well.

Although device will be described based on InGaAs InP material and device technology the methods and features discussed herein are not intended to be limited to that material system alone and other semiconductor materials including other III V and II VI compound semiconductor materials are included in the scope of the invention.

Device is a multilayer structure including n type large bandgap base or substrate layer n type small bandgap photosensor layer n type large bandgap layer small bandgap standoff layer p type collection well p type transfer well source contact gate transfer contact and drain contact and insulator layer . N type layer and collection well form short wavelength infrared SWIR photodiode PD. Layers and collection well transfer well source electrode gate transfer electrode and drain electrode form lateral junction field effect transistor JFET T.

In one embodiment n type large bandgap substrate layer is InP with a bandgap of about 1.344 eV. N type small bandgap layer is InGaAs with a thickness of about 3 to 3.5 m and bandgap of about 0.74 eV. N type large bandgap layer is InP with a thickness of about 0.5 to 1 m and a bandgap of about 1.344 eV. Small bandgap standoff layer is InGaAs with a thickness of about 0.5 m or less and a bandgap of about 0.74 eV.

In this embodiment P type collection well is formed by diffusion into InP layer and InGaAs layer . As a result collection well has a two layer structure comprising layers A and B. Layer A of collection well is InP with a thickness of about 0.5 to 1.0 m. Layer B of collection well is InGaAs with a thickness of about 0.25 m. Transfer well is formed by diffusion into standoff layer and large bandgap layer . As a result transfer well has a two layer structure comprising layers A and B. Layer A of transfer well is InGaAs with a thickness of about 0.5 m or less. Layer B of transfer well is InP with a thickness of about 0.05 m.

Source electrode gate transfer electrode and drain electrode may be Au Cu Ag Pd Pt Ni and others known in the art.

Schematic figures illustrating the operation of device are shown in . The device operates by collecting photoinduced carriers in P type collection well of photodiode T. The collected charge is transferred by transistor T from collection well which acts as the source region of T to transfer well which acts as the drain region of T . The charge in transfer well can then be read out without affecting generation and collection of carriers by photodiode PD.

In SWIR radiation is absorbed in high sensitivity photodetector layer and produces photo induced carriers c. In the carriers are driven toward collection well as indicated by arrows a and are swept across the pn junction formed by n type photodetection layer and collection well . As shown in the carriers in collection well are transferred to transfer well as schematically shown by arrow d. A positive voltage on transfer gate electrode inverts to p type the underlying large bandgap layer between collection well and transfer well . This allows charges c in collection well to move to transfer well . The charges in transfer well may then be sampled by an external ROIC circuit. There is complete charge transfer and no reset noise is generated during the transfer.

The 5T circuit in includes field effect transistors T T and optional capacitor C. Transistor T is a reset transistor that is turned on to reset device for the next charge transfer and readout cycle by connecting transfer well to ground. This resets transfer well before the next transfer of carriers from collection well .

Transistor T has its gate connected to drain contact of device . Transistor T acts as a source follower with its source voltage being a function of the charge in transfer well .

Transistors T and T are sample select and column select switches respectively that select the photosignal being delivered to the further ROIC circuitry. Capacitor C is used if it is desired to perform sample and column selects sequentially rather than simultaneously. In that case voltage at the source of T is stored in capacitor C and then read out by turning on column select transistor T.

A method of forming device is shown in in which collection well and transfer well are formed with a single diffusion. Standoff layer allows transfer well to be shallower than collection well . As a result p type collection well is in contact with n type small bandgap layer to form photodetector PD. P type transfer well on the other hand is located only in standoff layer and large bandgap layer . The pn junction formed by transfer well and large bandgap layer is not responsive to SWIR radiation.

The starting material shown in is a multilayer heterostructure made up of layers and . As an example layers and may be InP and layer may be InGaAs. The compositions and thicknesses of one specific embodiment have already been described. The heterostructure may be formed by any epitaxial growth process known in the art. Examples include organometallic vapor phase epitaxy OMVPE metal organic chemical vapor deposition MOCVD molecular beam epitaxy MBE and others known in the art. A preferred technique is MOCVD. In other embodiments layer may also be the substrate of the device and layer is not present.

In the next step as shown in standoff layer is deposited on layer . In portions of standoff layer have been removed. This can be achieved using photoresist masking and etching or by other selective removal techniques.

As shown in insulator layer has been deposited over the top surface of layer and over standoff layer . Insulator layer is for example silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride. Insulator layer is an electrical insulator and also functions as a diffusion barrier.

In diffusion windows and have been formed in insulator layer . Window defines an opening through which a p type dopant can be introduced for collection well . Window defines an opening through which the p type dopant can be introduced to form transfer well .

In a diffusion step has been performed to form collection well and transfer well . In the case of collection well the p type dopant diffuses through large bandgap layer into the upper portion of small bandgap layer . In the case of transfer well the p type dopant must first diffuse through standoff layer before reaching large bandgap layer . The diffusion rate of the p type dopant is lower in standoff layer than in large bandgap layer . As a result transfer well is confined to standoff layer and the upper portion of large bandgap . In this way collection well and transfer well are formed with a single diffusion yet have different depths.

In the final step as shown in contact regions are defined by photolithography and source contact gate transfer contact and drain contact are deposited on collection well insulator layer and standoff layer respectively. Contacts and are deposited by photolithography sputtering electroplating or other means of deposition known in the art. Preferred contact materials are Au Cu Ag Pd Pt Ni and others known in the art. In some embodiments source contact is not needed and can be omitted. Standoff layer is a small bandgap semiconductor such as InGaAs which helps to form an ohmic contact at drain contact .

Alternate versions A and D of the photodetector transistor device are illustrated in respectively. In device A of collection well forms a ring around transfer well and gate contact . Note that source contact is not present in device A.

In device B also uses a ring configuration. In this embodiment transfer well forms a ring around collection well and gate contact .

The photodetector transistor structures shown in offer certain design and manufacturing features and benefits. They include 

Charge well may be a buried p type diffusion layer surrounded by a detailed bandgap engineered material on all sides except through the charge collection region. This allows charge to be collected while keeping collected dark current low and separating the collection area from the surface of the InGaAs material. This buried layer minimizes both surface recombination and shunt contribution to noise.

The integrated photodetector transistor structure plus a mechanism for dumping the charge from transfer well may be included in 5 8 micrometer pixels.

By avoiding the capacitor reset noise of the prior art the inherent noise of the pixel may be orders of magnitudes lower than prior art devices.

The architecture of the present invention may achieve up to about five times 5 greater sensitivity enabling night imaging at below starlight levels while reducing pixel pitch by up to about three times 3 . As a result the detectors may operate at lower light conditions operate at higher operating temperature for a given light level operate at lower power since for example cooling is not needed to improve performance and higher resolution is achieved in a smaller detector with smaller optics and a higher areal density of chips on a wafer resulting in reduced cost.

The integrated structure can be formed using only two different semiconductor materials such as InP and InGaAs and a single diffusion to achieve collection and transfer wells of different depths.
