Mobile data communications can enable a wide variety of services. However mobile data providers such as cell phone providers mobile virtual network operators MVNO s or mobile virtual network enablers MVNE s have processes for example provisioning processes that are tailored for standard cell phone services. In particular an equipment provider or another type of customer for mobile data communications may desire to provide equipment enabled to use mobile data communications. In order to test that the equipment is fully functional with a mobile data communications provider the equipment provider in the current environment most likely will be required to completely activate the equipment i.e. provision it including establishing a service plan with customer billing. When the testing is complete the service plan will likely be terminated and the final customer will be required to reactivate the service plan with customer billing. It would be beneficial if the mobile data providers processes for example provisioning could be tailored for the needs of customers of mobile data communications.

In some embodiments functionality of HLR and AAA server are performed by the same server are partitioned between two servers but not exactly as described herein or any other server configuration to achieve the same functionality.

In some embodiments one or more states are based on the lifecycle of the service of a wireless communication device.

A test ready state can be used to allow a manufacturer to test a SIM or a device with a SIM and its network communication infrastructure before delivering the SIM or device with a SIM to an end user a retail location or a distributor. A test ready state can be a default state for a SIM that allows authentication and authorization with a provider s HLR and AAA server but does not have any billing associated with it. A SIM in a test ready state is able to conditionally transact data voice and or Short Message Service SMS communications for example some limits may be placed on the communications while in this state such as communication may occur up to a maximum data transmitted received amount or up to a maximum number of days since the initial data communication. A test ready state may have no prerequisite state have no limitation to a next state e.g. all states allowed as next state have no exclusivity rule be a required state and be allowed to have automatic and or manual transitions.

An inventory state can be used to allow a SIM to be placed in a device and associated with an identifier of the device e.g. a terminal identifier or a point of sale terminal identifier . An inventory state cannot coexist with an activation ready state. An inventory state cannot connect with the network and requires a manual change in order to change state. An inventory state may have a test ready state as a prerequisite have no limitation to a next state e.g. all states allowed as next state have an exclusivity rule in that it cannot coexist with an activation ready state not be a required state and be allowed only to have manual transitions.

An activation ready state can be used to allow a SIM to be ready to be activated. An activation ready state will authenticate and authorize with the HLR and AAA server of the provider system but no billing will occur. After the first data communication e.g. first packet data protocol PDP context communication the SIM state will automatically change to an activated state. An activation ready state may have a test ready state or inventory state as a prerequisite have no limitation to a next state e.g. all states allowed as next state have an exclusivity rule in that it cannot coexist with an inventory state not be a required state and be allowed to have an automatic transition to an activated state or a manual transition to other states.

An activated state can be used to allow a SIM or a device with a SIM to be used by a user. In an activated state the SIM will authenticate and authorize on the HLR and AAA server of the provider system. Billing commences immediately on changing to this state. The provider system may check to make sure that the proper information is contained on the HLR and AAA server databases as well as the billing databases. In some cases the checks will include checking the identifiers e.g. SIM international mobile subscriber identifier IMSI customer identifier device identifier etc. . An activated state may have a test ready state inventory or activation ready state as a prerequisite have possible next states of deactivated purged or retired have no exclusivity rule not be a required state and be only allowed to have a manual transition to a next state.

A deactivated state can be used to allow a SIM or a device with a SIM to be deactivated by the user. In a deactivated state the SIM will not be allowed to authenticate and will not be billed. The AAA server of the provider system and the gateway GPRS support node GGSN of carrier networks will be sent a notification e.g. a packet informing them that the SIM has been deactivated. An deactivated state may have a activated state as a prerequisite have possible next states of activated purged or retired have no exclusivity rule not be a required state and be only allowed to have a manual transition to a next state.

A retired state can be used to allow a SIM or a device with a SIM to be retired by the provider or the user. In a retired state the SIM will not be allowed to authenticate and billing ends. A retired state may have any state as a prerequisite except purged have any possible next states i.e. all states possible have no exclusivity rule not be a required state and be only allowed to have a manual transition to a next state.

A purged state can be used to allow a SIM or a device with a SIM to be purged by the provider. In a purged state the SIM will not be allowed to authenticate and the SIM is removed from the system e.g. IMSI permanently removed from the HLR of the provider system . A purged state may have any state as a prerequisite have no possible next states have no exclusivity rule not be a required state and be not allowed to have any transitions to a next state.

In some embodiments a state is defined by a customer. In some embodiments the state is defined using an Internet based service.

In some embodiments a state definition does not support communication sessions and a transition to that state will terminate existing open communication sessions.

In some embodiments a first wireless communication provisioning state allows a communication device to pass traffic without incurring any billing charges and an associated state transition rule allows an automated transition to a second provisioning state where the second provisioning state incurs billing charges. In some embodiments a first wireless communication provisioning state allows a communication device to pass traffic without incurring any billing charges and an associated state transition rule allows an automated transition to the second provisioning state where the second provisioning state does not allow the communication device to pass traffic.

In state transition rule s between two states is are defined. A transition from one state to another may occur automatically on a predetermined condition or manually. If the transition is based on a condition is met e.g. upon first data communication packet data protocol context established the state will automatically change from one to another e.g. activation ready state to activated state . In various embodiments the transition condition is based on one or more of the following a predetermined amount of elapsed time since a prior state transition an amount of service usage above a predetermined amount of service usage one or more service signalings or any other appropriate condition. In various embodiments the condition is based on an exclusivity rule a state rule a communication data transfer or any other appropriate condition. A manual change from one state to another requires an intervention directly from the provider system for example an action through a manager portal by uploading a file to the SIM or device with the SIM or an application programming interface API call.

In various embodiments a state transition rule can be defined for an individual device or a group of devices or different rules can be defined for different individual devices or different groups of devices or any other appropriate combination as appropriate for meeting the needs of a supplier of devices.

In some embodiments a group of states are defined and a group of transition rules are defined and then a selection of states and transition rules are associated with one or more identifiers.

In some embodiments a customer selects a state transition rule. In some embodiments a customer defines a state transition rule. In various embodiments the state transition rule is selected and or defined using an Internet based service using a local program interface or any other appropriate manner of selecting and defining a state transition rule.

In some embodiments a state transition rule when activated terminates existing communication sessions.

In inventory state a device is waiting to be transferred to a user. In this state no connectivity is enabled and no billing occurs. The state is maintained until transition . Transition occurs when the OEM or the customer or its channel service providers manually triggers a state change. When the state change is triggered the SIM is changed to activated state . In activated state a device is being used by user. In activated state the SIM is able to establish a PDP session and connect and transfer data to a customer application server via a carrier network. The user is billed for the service provided by the provider. Billing information is provided to the customer by gathering the relevant data from the network carriers and the provider s data bases. The SIM remains in the active state until triggered to transition. Transition may be triggered manually or automatically. In various embodiments transition is triggered automatically by a maximum number of connections allowed a maximum amount of data transferred a maximum amount of time since the start of PDP sessions or any other appropriate automatic trigger condition. In some embodiments the user or the customer can also manually trigger transition to a deactivated state .

In deactivated state a device is finished being used as requested by an end user or by a customer system request by being in a deactivated state. In deactivated state the SIM is not able to connect and establish a PDP session. While in deactivated state there is no billing for connectivity. Transition can be triggered automatically e.g. after a period of time or manually e.g. by the customer . When transition is triggered the SIM changes state to purged state . In purged state the SIM and the device the SIM is in is removed from the system. In purged state the SIM is not able to connect and establish a PDP session. There is no billing associated with the trigger or the state. Accounting for the customer may remove the item from inventory or asset lists. Purged state automatically removes the IMSI and International Circuit Card Identifier ICCID from the HLR of the provider system.

In activation ready state a device is waiting to be transferred to a user. In various embodiments the activation ready state is set after testing by the OEM when the device is being shipped from the OEM to retail locations distribution partners directly to end users or when the SIM or device with the SIM is about to be in the end users hands but is not ready to have billing service fully implemented. In this state SIM connectivity is enabled and a PDP session can be established. Upon the first PDP session occurring transition is triggered. When the state change is triggered the SIM is changed to activated state . In activated state a device is being used by user. In activated state the SIM is able to establish a PDP session and connect and transfer data to a customer application server via a carrier network. The user is billed for the service provided by the provider. Billing information is provided to the customer by gathering the relevant data from the network carriers and the provider s data bases. The SIM remains in the active state until triggered to transition. Transition may be triggered manually or automatically. In various embodiments transition is triggered automatically by a maximum number of connections allowed a maximum amount of data transferred a maximum amount of time since the start of PDP sessions or any other appropriate automatic trigger condition. In some embodiments the user or the customer can also manually trigger transition to a deactivated state .

In deactivated state a device is finished being used as requested by an end user or by a customer system request by being in a deactivated state.
