This application is a new U.S. patent application that claims benefit of JP 2014 89301 filed on Apr. 23 2014 the entire content of JP 2014 89301 is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to an LED lighting apparatus and a method for manufacturing the same and more specifically to an LED lighting apparatus constructed by mounting an LED device onto an aluminum substrate and a method for manufacturing such an LED lighting apparatus.

In recent years LED devices as semiconductor devices have come into wide use in illumination and other applications due to their long life and excellent driving characteristics as well as their compact size good luminous efficacy and crisp and bright color emission.

To construct a lighting apparatus for illumination purposes it is known to apply specular treatment such as vapor deposition or anodizing treatment to an aluminum surface and then mount an LED device thereon so that the light emitted from the LED device can be reflected efficiently for example refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2007 109701 .

However there has been the problem that when a wiring substrate electrodes etc. that are connected to the LED devices by being bonded to the specular surface by means of an adhesive sheet or the like the wiring substrate etc. may delaminate at the layers formed by the specular treatment because the adhesion between the layers formed by the specular treatment is insufficient.

There has also been the problem that when the aluminum substrate is subjected to thermal expansion and thermal shrinkage due to changes in ambient temperature interlayer delamination may occur between the layers formed by the specular treatment and in this case also the wiring substrate etc. may become delaminated.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an LED lighting apparatus and a method for manufacturing the same that can solve the above problems.

It is also an object of the present invention to provide an LED lighting apparatus and a method for manufacturing the same that can improve the bonding strength between an aluminum substrate and a printed wiring substrate.

An LED lighting apparatus includes an aluminum substrate a plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers formed on the aluminum substrate an LED device bonded on the plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers a printed wiring substrate bonded onto a region on the aluminum substrate other than a region where the plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers are formed a wire for connecting between the printed wiring substrate and the LED device a frame member formed so as to surround the LED device and a phosphor resin deposited over a region inside the frame member.

Preferably in the LED lighting apparatus the printed wiring substrate is bonded on a roughened surface region formed outside the region where the plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers are formed.

Preferably in the LED lighting apparatus the plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers comprise an adhesive layer a reflective layer and an enhanced reflectivity layer.

A method for manufacturing an LED lighting apparatus includes the steps of forming a mask on an aluminum substrate on which a plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers are formed forming a roughened surface region on the aluminum substrate by removing the plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers everywhere except where the mask is formed bonding a printed wiring substrate on the roughened surface region bonding an LED device on the plurality of reflectivity enhanced layers from which the mask has been removed connecting the LED device to the printed wiring substrate by a wire and depositing a phosphor resin over a region inside a frame member formed so as to surround the LED device.

According to the LED lighting apparatus and the method for manufacturing the same as stated above the printed wiring substrate does not become delaminated from the aluminum substrate and thus an LED lighting apparatus with high reliability can be provided.

An LED lighting apparatus according to the present invention and a method for manufacturing the same will be described below with reference to the drawings. It should however be noted that the technical scope of the present invention is not limited by any particular embodiment described herein but extends to the inventions described in the appended claims and their equivalents.

The LED lighting apparatus comprises an aluminum substrate a printed wiring substrate a frame member LED devices and a phosphor resin and is installed to a lighting fixture by means of guiding holes provided in edge portions.

In a device mounting region enclosed by the frame member formed in a substantially circular shape by depositing a silicone resin there are formed an adhesive layer a reflective layer and an enhanced reflectivity layer one on top of another on the aluminum substrate for enhanced reflection.

The adhesive layer is an anodized aluminum layer. The reflective layer is an Ag or Al deposited layer whose reflectivity is 90 or higher. The enhanced reflectivity layer is formed from a stack of at least one SiOlayer and at least one TiOlayer having a greater refractive index than SiO. A stack of an AlOlayer and a TiOlayer having a greater refractive index than AlOmay be used instead of the stack of the SiOand TiOlayers. The enhanced reflectivity layer is provided in order to enhance reflectivity.

In the device mounting region the LED devices arranged in three groups each of 12 LED devices connected in series are connected in parallel by gold wires between electrodes and formed on the printed wiring substrate . Each LED device is bonded by a die bonding material directly to the reflectivity enhanced surface of the aluminum substrate . The LED device emits light when a prescribed voltage is applied between the electrodes and formed on the printed wiring substrate .

The phosphor resin for protecting the LED devices is formed inside the frame member so as to enclose the LED devices . A transparent epoxy resin or silicone resin is used to form the phosphor resin . The phosphor resin contains phosphors dispersed through the resin. Since the phosphors absorb a portion of the blue light emitted from the LED devices and produce yellow light by wavelength conversion the LED lighting apparatus emits white light with the yellow light mixing with the blue light. The phosphor resin may also contain a diffusing material for uniformly diffusing the light emitted from the LED devices .

A roughened surface region not treated for enhanced reflection but treated by roughening the aluminum surface is formed on the aluminum substrate so as to surround the device mounting region . The printed wiring substrate is bonded on the roughened surface region by means of an adhesive sheet . The printed wiring substrate includes a base and a resist in addition to the electrodes etc.

In the device mounting region treated for enhanced reflection with the plurality of layers the adhesion between the layers is insufficient therefore if the printed wiring substrate is bonded on this region the printed wiring substrate may become delaminated from the aluminum substrate due to interlayer delamination. Furthermore when the aluminum substrate is subjected to thermal expansion or shrinkage due to changes in ambient temperature interlayer delamination may also occur causing the printed wiring substrate to delaminate from the aluminum substrate . By contrast in the LED lighting apparatus since the printed wiring substrate is bonded not on the device mounting region treated for enhanced reflection but on the roughened surface region by using the adhesive sheet the printed wiring substrate can be firmly bonded to the aluminum substrate . Furthermore since the printed wiring substrate does not become delaminated from the aluminum substrate due to the thermal history given to the LED lighting apparatus when for example installing the LED lighting apparatus to a lighting fixture it becomes possible to manufacture a package with high reliability.

First as shown in a reflectivity enhanced aluminum plate is prepared. In this example Miro 20.7t manufactured by Anorad was used as the reflectivity enhanced aluminum plate . The reflectivity enhanced aluminum plate has a multilayered structure in which the adhesive layer of anodized aluminum the reflective layer of an Al deposited film and the enhanced reflectivity layer formed from a stack of SiOand TiOlayers at least one each are deposited one on top of another on the aluminum substrate . If the reflective layer is formed from an Ag deposited film the reflectivity will improve but since it is susceptible to corrosion an Al deposited film is used here.

Next as shown in the guiding holes are opened through the aluminum plate by using a drilling machine.

Next as shown in a photosensitive dry film is laminated to the surface of the aluminum plate by using a laminator. In this example an alkaline developing dry film PHOTEC registered trademark H 7025 manufactured by Hitachi Chemical was used as the photosensitive dry film .

Next as shown in a negative film for masking the device mounting region is laminated by a vacuum onto the photosensitive dry film and is exposed to ultraviolet radiation B to cure only the portion of the photosensitive dry film that masks the device mounting region . Then as shown in the exposed photosensitive dry film is developed using a developing solution thus forming a mask on the device mounting region . A 1 alkaline solution was used as the developing solution.

In the steps shown in the mask has been formed by wet processing which involves developing the photosensitive dry film . Alternatively a rubber based ink such as a strippable solder resist peel coat may be applied over the device mounting region by screen printing and then thermally cured to form the mask .

Next as shown in particles C are sprayed at high speed by sand blasting thereby removing the portions of the adhesive layer reflective layer and enhanced reflectivity layer that lie outside the region covered by the mask and the exposed surface of the aluminum substrate is roughened to form the roughened surface region . In the step shown in ice blasting which uses ice particles may be employed instead of sand blasting. Ice blasting is preferable to sand blasting because the latter tends to leave a residue.

In the step shown in the roughened surface region has been formed by a physical means such as sand blasting or ice blasting but the roughened surface region may be formed chemically by using an etching solution of sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. When chemically forming the roughened surface region it is desirable to laminate the photosensitive dry film on both sides of the aluminum plate . Further instead of using the physical means the roughened surface region may be formed electrically by plasma processing.

Next as shown in the printed wiring substrate with the adhesive sheet tentatively attached thereto is registered with respect to the aluminum substrate and is laminated to the roughened surface region under prescribed temperature and pressure. The printed wiring substrate before lamination comprises the base the electrodes etc. and the resist and guiding holes about the same size as the guiding holes formed in the aluminum plate are formed in respectively corresponding positions. Next using the die bonding material each LED device is bonded on the device mounting region . Then the LED devices are connected to each other as well as to the electrodes and by using the gold wires .

Next as shown in using a dispenser a silicone resin is deposited in a substantially circular shape around the device mounting region and cured to form the frame member . The height of the frame member is preferably in the range of 100 m to 600 m. Next using a dispenser the phosphor resin is deposited inside the frame member and cured to complete the manufacturing of the LED lighting apparatus . A transparent silicone resin may be molded over the phosphor resin .

First as shown in an aluminum substrate not treated for enhanced reflection is prepared. In this example a general purpose aluminum alloy 55052 01.2t available from Sumitomo Light Metal Industries was used to form the aluminum substrate .

Next as shown in the guiding holes are opened through the aluminum substrate by using a drilling machine.

Next as shown in an adhesive layer of anodized aluminum a reflective layer of an Ag deposited film and an enhanced reflectivity layer formed from a stack of SiOand TiOlayers at least one each are deposited one on top of another only on a region corresponding to the device mounting region .

Next as shown in the printed wiring substrate with the adhesive sheet tentatively attached thereto is registered with respect to the aluminum substrate and is laminated under prescribed temperature and pressure to the region where the stack of the adhesive layer reflective layer and enhanced reflectivity layer is not formed. The printed wiring substrate before lamination comprises the base the electrodes etc. and the resist and guiding holes about the same size as the guiding holes formed in the aluminum plate are formed in respectively corresponding positions. Next using the die bonding material each LED device is bonded on the device mounting region . Then the LED devices are connected to each other as well as to the electrodes and by using the gold wires .

Next using a dispenser a silicone resin is deposited in a substantially circular shape around the device mounting region and cured to form the frame member . The height of the frame member is preferably in the range of 100 m to 600 m. Next using a dispenser the phosphor resin is deposited inside the frame member and cured to complete the manufacturing of the LED lighting apparatus . A transparent silicone resin may be molded over the phosphor resin .

The only difference between the LED lighting apparatus shown in and the LED lighting apparatus shown in is the presence or absence of the roughened surface region which is present in the LED lighting apparatus but is absent in the LED lighting apparatus which instead has the untreated surface of the aluminum substrate exposed.

In the LED lighting apparatus also since the printed wiring substrate is bonded not on the device mounting region treated for enhanced reflection but on the surface of the aluminum substrate by using the adhesive sheet the printed wiring substrate can be firmly bonded to the aluminum substrate . Furthermore since the printed wiring substrate do not delaminate from the aluminum substrate due to the thermal history given to the LED lighting apparatus when for example installing the LED lighting apparatus to a lighting fixture it is possible to manufacture a package with high reliability.
