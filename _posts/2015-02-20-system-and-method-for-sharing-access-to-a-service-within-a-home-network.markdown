Home routers providing wired and or wireless local area network LAN access to client devices in the home environment are typically connected to a wide area network WAN such as the Internet which provides high capacity wired or wireless communications links to web service operations which may be accessed by a client device connected to the LAN provided that the user credentials associated with each request is authenticated by the web service. However user attempts to access a web service from different client devices connected to the LAN will typically require that the user recall their credentials and login again from each client device. This becomes especially problematic in a multi device multi platform multi user environment with logins having to be done for each access method for the web service the user wants to access. While solutions have been proposed for synchronizing bookmarks settings and credentials for a particular browser across devices and ecosystems such solutions typically require that the same application e.g. Chrome is used across all devices for a particular service. There have been other attempts to synchronize web service access requests from multiple users or devices but such approaches have required server side solutions at the web service heavy weight session data resource management between client devices and or distributed storage of credentials at the client devices. As a result the existing solutions for efficiently synchronizing authorized user actions across a variety of access points for the same service are extremely difficult at a practical level.

Broadly speaking selected embodiments of the present disclosure provide a system method and apparatus for synchronizing the user experience in accessing a service across multiple devices by storing service credentials of a first authenticated user at the home network router for shared use with subsequent access requests to the service by the other devices platforms and portals at the home network. The home network router may be embodied as an information handling system which includes persistent credential storage for storing and sharing service credentials to enable different devices and or browsers at the home network to seamlessly share access to a network service. By storing service credentials at the home network router a user who starts interacting with a service on a first device e.g. an iPhone can pick up where the user left off on another device e.g. an Android tablet Windows laptop iMac etc. regardless of the access method i.e. mobile application browser etc. used on the second device. In addition to storing service credentials the home network router may include router firmware such as DD WRT a Linux based firmware for wireless routers and access points with an integrated custom service that is configured to facilitate an initial authentication exchange with a service collect credentials from the user being authenticated request permission from the user to store the credentials at the home network router and then check the stored credentials for the user whenever the service is re accessed from home to avoid requiring credential reentry. To address scenarios where there are multiple users on the same service each user may be prompted to choose between entities recognized by the home network router.

In the distributed data processing system the client devices may take the form of a personal computer mobile computing device mobile communications device e.g. Internet enabled phone television set top box or other suitable electronic device. For example the client devices may include for example a tablet computer a hand held computer or mobile phone a laptop computer a Windows based personal computer a Mac personal computer or any other type of networked computer or machine. Each client device may include a processor to execute instructions stored on the client device as software and or firmware. Such instructions may form an operating system of client device an application program a software component such as a plug in or other suitable instruction set or combination thereof. In selected embodiments the client device instructions may be configured to operate in coordination with instructions stored and executed at the gateway router to facilitate access over the network to a network service e.g. . As one example client device may take the form of a smart mobile computing device that further supports wireless connectivity to the gateway router . As a another example client device may take the form of a smart mobile communications device e.g. an Internet enabled phone that further supports wireless connectivity to the gateway router via a mobile broadband technology such as for example 3G or 4G.

The network may include connections such as wire wireless communication links or fiber optic cables. In an example embodiment where the distributed data processing system is the Internet the network may represent a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers consisting of thousands of commercial governmental educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course the distributed data processing system may also be implemented to include a number of different types of networks such as for example an intranet a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN or the like. As will be appreciate the distributed data processing system is provided as an example not as an architectural limitation for different embodiments of the disclosed subject matter and therefore the particular elements shown in should not be considered limiting with regard to the environments in which the illustrative embodiments of the present invention may be implemented.

To facilitate communication over the network a gateway router is provided to support shared access to a remote network service among client devices of the home network by using stored credentials to synchronize user access to the remote web service. To this end the gateway router is positioned along a communications path between the wide area network WAN and a local area network LAN of client devices defining a home network. Thus the gateway router may be implemented as on premises equipment to provide LAN access to homes residences businesses or other suitable LAN use environments and may take the form of a private gateway or access point that is owned and or operated by an owner or operator of the home residence business or use environment in which the gateway router is deployed in contrast to some public or business network routers. In this position the gateway router may capture and store service credentials for a network service from a user at a first client device to enable the user access the network service from second client device without re entering the credentials. In a storage device of the gateway router captured credentials from a first user client device e.g. are stored at a persistent credential store to enable subsequent access to the associated network service by other client devices e.g. .

As depicted the gateway router may include a processor storage device and communications interface . The processor is connected to retrieve and store data and to execute instructions stored in the storage device which may include or take the form of non volatile memory such as a hard drive flash memory device or other suitable non volatile memory and or volatile memory which may be used to store instructions and data . The instructions may be stored in the storage device as software and or firmware to form part of an operating system of gateway router an application program a software component such as a plug in or other suitable instruction set or combination thereof. In selected embodiments the gateway router instructions may be configured to operate in coordination with associated or paired client device instructions e.g. software or firmware and or instructions e.g. software or firmware executed at a network server computer to facilitate access over the network to a network service e.g. Network Service A . In support of such functionality the storage device of gateway router may also include a data store for data storage and or retrieval. The storage device may also include a persistent credential store for storing service credential information that is used to authenticate a client device when accessing a network service. As described in greater detail hereinbelow the persistent credential store may store authentication related credentials provided upon initial validation of the user identification and login password by network service. For example the user s service credentials may be stored along with information identifying the corresponding website application in the persistent credential store of the home gateway router in an encrypted file such as by creating for each user a folder for each website application in which the service credential is stored as an encrypted file or cookie.

The processor is also connected to the communication interface which supports wired and or wireless communications between the home network client devices and the network service devices using one or more wired and or wireless transceivers modems or other suitable electronic devices to facilitate communications between computing devices. Using the communication interface the gateway router may support Internet communications over the WAN and wired and or wireless communications between gateway router and client devices through any suitable communication protocol including but not limited to Wi Fi e.g. 802.11 Wi MAX e.g. 802.16 LTE e.g. 3GPP TS 36 UMTS e.g. 3GPP TS 25 CDMA Bluetooth or the like.

By executing stored instructions and data at the processor the gateway router may establish communication sessions with LAN client devices by routing communications between these client devices and the network service devices . For example a first client device e.g. may connect to a home wireless access network by establishing a communication link to the gateway router and opening a first web browser e.g. Internet Explorer to navigate to a website server which requires authentication of the user before providing a network service e.g. Network Service A . At the website server the credential service module interacts with the first client device to authenticate the user s credentials such as by requiring entry of the user s userid and password information. Upon receipt of messaging information from the website server indicating that the user is authenticated instructions and data are executed at the processor to present a message prompt to the first client device to ask if the user would like to store credentials in the home network to avoid having to re enter the credentials when accessing the site on another browser or device at home network. In selected embodiments the message prompt may include option buttons such as Yes No Do Not Ask Again and Maybe Later. In the event that the user selects Yes the service credentials for the accessed network service e.g. Network Service A are stored in the persistent credential store so that any subsequent connection to the same network service e.g. Network Service A by a different client device e.g. is directly logged in without requiring re entry of credentials by the user at the second device even the second client device uses a different web browser e.g. Mozilla Firefox to navigate to the network service . Once the user on one device e.g. in the home network accepts credential storage for a network service the stored service credentials may be used to authenticate through all portals and applications on the other client devices that browse the same network service. This includes authenticating to an iPhone application Android application and websites on both Safari iMac and Chrome on a Windows laptop. To address scenarios where a home network includes multiple users on the same network service the instructions and data executed at the processor may be configured to present an additional message prompt for the user to choose which of the plurality of identities the gateway router recognizes.

With reference now to there is shown a block diagram of a data processing system in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system is an example of a computer such as any of the client devices or gateway router in in which computer usable program code or instructions implementing the processes may be located for the illustrative embodiments. In this illustrative example data processing system includes communications fabric which provides communications between processor unit memory persistent storage communications unit input output I O unit and display .

Processor unit serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory . Processor unit may be a set of one or more processors or may be a multi processor core depending on the particular implementation. Further processor unit may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example processor unit may be a symmetric multi processor SMP system containing multiple processors of the same type.

Memory and persistent storage are examples of storage devices. A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information either on a temporary basis and or a permanent basis. Memory in these examples may be for example a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non volatile storage device. Persistent storage may take various forms depending on the particular implementation and may contain one or more components or devices. For example persistent storage may be a hard drive a flash memory a rewritable optical disk a rewritable magnetic tape or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage also may be removable. For example a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage . When embodying a home network router either of both of the memory and persistent storage may store the service credentials and associated firmware and or software which are used to synchronize and authenticate access to a selected network service from any portal and application accessing the network service from client devices connected through the home network router. Further a memory may be for example a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .

In selected embodiments a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric and may be comprised of one or more buses such as a system bus or an input output bus. As will be appreciated the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system.

Communications unit in these examples provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices. In these examples communications unit is a network interface card. Communications unit may provide communications through the use of either or both physical and wireless communications links. Additionally the communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data such as a modem or a network adapter.

Input output unit allows for input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system . For example input output unit may provide a connection for user input through a keyboard and mouse. Further input output unit may send output to a printer. Display provides a mechanism to display information to a user.

Instructions for the operating system and applications or programs are located on persistent storage . These instructions may be loaded into memory for execution by processor unit . The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit using computer implemented instructions which may be located in a memory such as memory . These instructions are referred to as program code computer usable program code or computer readable program code that may be read and executed by a processor in processor unit . The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media such as memory or persistent storage .

Program code is located in a functional form on computer readable media that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system for execution by processor unit . Program code and computer readable media form computer program product in these examples. In one example computer readable media may be in a tangible form such as for example an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage for transfer onto a storage device such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage . In a tangible form computer readable media also may take the form of a persistent storage such as a hard drive a thumb drive or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system . The tangible form of computer readable media is also referred to as computer recordable storage media. In some instances computer recordable media may not be removable. Alternatively program code may be transferred to data processing system from computer readable media through a communications link to communications unit and or through a connection to input output unit . The communications link and or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The computer readable media also may take the form of non tangible media such as communications links or wireless transmissions containing the program code.

The different components illustrated for data processing system are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for data processing system . Other components shown in can be varied from the illustrative examples shown. As one example a storage device in data processing system is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory persistent storage and computer readable media are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.

As will be appreciated the hardware shown in may vary depending on the implementation so that other internal hardware or peripheral devices such as flash memory equivalent non volatile memory or optical disk drives and the like may be used in addition to or in place of the depicted hardware. Also the processes of the illustrative embodiments may be applied to a multiprocessor data processing system without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosed subject matter. In addition the techniques described herein may operate in conjunction within any desired client server paradigm such as illustrated in where client machines e.g. smart phone communicate with an Internet accessible Web based portal e.g. network service device executing on a set of one or more machines. End users operate Internet connectable devices e.g. desktop computers notebook computers Internet enabled mobile devices or the like that are capable of accessing and interacting with the portal. Typically each client or server machine is a data processing system such as illustrated in comprising hardware and software and these entities communicate with one another over a network such as the Internet an intranet an extranet a private network or any other communications medium or link. A data processing system typically includes one or more processors an operating system one or more applications and one or more utilities. The applications on the data processing system provide native support for Web services including without limitation support for HTTP SOAP XML WSDL UDDI and WSFL among others. Information regarding SOAP WSDL UDDI and WSFL is available from the World Wide Web Consortium W3C which is responsible for developing and maintaining these standards further information regarding HTTP and XML is available from Internet Engineering Task Force IETF . Familiarity with these standards is presumed.

To provide additional details for an improved understanding of selected embodiments of the present disclosure reference is now made to which depicts a simplified flow chart showing the logic and processing steps for using credentials stored at a home router to synchronize network service access by multiple devices platforms and portals associated with the home network. The processing and logic shown in is distribute across one or more home network users a home network router and a remote network service each of which may be embodied with a data processing system such as shown in . At step the process commences when a first online user connects a first client device e.g. a personal computer to the home wireless access network where the connection is made from a platform e.g. Windows OS at the first client device which communicates with the home network router . Through the connection with the home network router the first online user accesses a remote network service by exchanging access messages across the home network router to establish a first session with the network service at step . In an example scenario the first session may be established by opening a portal e.g. Internet Explorer browser at the first client device and navigating to a website system which hosts the desired network service.

At step the first online user at the first client device accesses the desired network service by registering logging in or otherwise sending credentials to authenticate the first online user to the desired network service . Through the connection with the home network router the first online user may be authenticated such as by sending login and password data to the remote network service for processing. At step the user credentials entered by the first online user through the platform portal at the first client device are evaluated by the network service though the specific authentication procedures and mechanisms may vary from one system to the next.

Upon validation of the first online user s credentials the home network router receives messaging information from the network service or from the first client device indicating that the first online user is authenticated. In response the home network router presents a message prompt to the first client device at step to ask if the first online user would like to store credentials in the home network router to avoid having to re enter the credentials when accessing the network service site from any device portal or platform at the home network. In an example scenario the message prompt generated at step is presented on the first client device as a pop up message which includes response option buttons such as Yes No Do Not Ask Again and Maybe Later. The message prompt functionality may be embodied in the home network router as software or firmware such as DD WRT a Linux based firmware for wireless routers and access points with an integrated custom service that is configured to facilitate an initial authentication exchange with a network service to collect credentials from the user being authenticated and to request permission from the user to store the credentials at the home network router.

At step the first online user selects Yes to activate the credential storage function and the first client device sends messaging information to the home network router indicating that the service credentials for the accessed network service e.g. Network Service A may be stored in the persistent credential store of the home network router so that any subsequent connection to the same network service e.g. Network Service A by a different client device portal or platform is directly logged in without requiring re entry of credentials by the user at the second device portal platform. For example the messaging information from step may be sent by an application programming interface API at the first client device which is activated to send an event notification to the home network router . The credential storage functionality may be embodied in the home network router as software or firmware such as DD WRT with an integrated custom service that is configured to collect and store authenticated credentials from the first online user.

As an enhanced security feature the activation of the credential storage function at step may be protected by requiring the user at the first client device to enter a passphrase before being given access to the credential storage function. For example the presentation of response option buttons to the first client device at step may optionally include a prompt for the first client device to provide a separate additional security passphrase for securely accessing the credential storage at the home network router though this prompt may also be provided in a separate message. In such embodiments the credential store passphrase may be distinct from the passphrase required to access the network and from the passphrase or credentials provided to authenticate the first client device to the network service. In selected embodiments where the user at the first client device has not previously created a credential storage account with the home network router the user would be prompted upon activating the credential storage function at step to register or create an account with home network router whereby the first client device creates a credential store access passphrase for accessing the credential storage at the home network router . However where the user at the first client device has already created an account with the home network router the user would be prompted upon activating the credential storage function at step to enter the credential store access passphrase when the user chooses to store the credentials at the home network router . As will be appreciated the credential store access passphrase requirement will protect the credential storage function when used in selected enterprise implementations.

In response to the event notification message the home network router stores service credentials with the associated network service information at step . The service credentials may be stored with associated network service information in the persistent credential storage of the home network router on per user basis. For example a directory may be opened in memory for the first online user e.g. Mike along with a subdirectory for the accessed network service e.g. PayPal or Runtastic and in the subdirectory an encrypted file or cookie may be stored which includes at least the user s service credentials if not also additional information identifying the first online user first client device access application portal platform and or accessed network service. However in selected embodiments only the service credentials are stored so as to be browser and device neutral.

With the service credentials stored at the home network router an online user from another device platform or portal at the home network may initiate access to the network service at step . For example the first online user may connect a second client device e.g. a tablet to the home network router from different platform portal e.g. Mozilla Firefox at the second client device by sending an access request to the home network router . Alternatively a second different online user may connect a third client device e.g. a smart phone to the home network router from different platform portal e.g. Android OS at the third client device by sending an access request to the home network router .

At step the access request is processed by the home network router to determine whether the home network router has credentials for the requested network service. For example the directory structure in a persistent credential store may be searched to locate a subdirectory corresponding to the requested network service. The credential search functionality may be embodied in the home network router as software or firmware such as DD WRT with an integrated custom service that is configured to check the stored credentials for the requesting online user whenever the network service is re accessed from the home network to avoid requiring credential reentry.

If the service credentials are stored at the home network router affirmative outcome to step the home network router uses the stored credentials at step to authenticate the access request from the second device platform portal and automatically log the user into the network service at step without requiring re entry of the credentials from the online user . Though not shown the processing at step may also include the generation of a message prompt to the online user to choose between entities or user identities recognized by the home network router to address scenarios where there are multiple users from the home network accessing the same network service.

On the other hand if the service credentials are not stored at the home network router negative outcome to step the second client device is prompted at step to register log in or otherwise submit credentials to authenticate the online user. At step the home network router forwards the credentials to the network service for authentication at step and may also present a message prompt to the second client device to ask if the online user would like to store credentials in the home network router .

As will be appreciated the credential search and processing functionality of steps may be embodied in the home network router as software or firmware such as DD WRT with an integrated custom service that is configured to check memory for stored credentials and use any located credentials to automatically authenticate the requesting online user directly with the network service when re accessing the network access from the home network to avoid requiring credential reentry. In addition the credential search and processing functionality may be embodied in router software or firmware which is configured to one or more enhanced administration features. For example access to a specified network service by one or more specified home network users may be selectively enabled or disabled to control home network access. In a similar fashion access to a specified network service by one or more specified browsers application or devices may be selectively enabled or disabled to control home network access.

With the disclosed system method and apparatus for storing service credentials on the home router upon approval by a user at a first device other devices portals and applications on the home network can use the stored credentials to seamlessly access the service. For example in a household with two Windows laptops an iMac an iPhone and an Android tablet access to a network service for fitness tracking e.g. www.runtastic.com may be synchronized among the devices portals and users on the home network by storing service credentials at the home router once a user on a first device e.g. the iPhone is authenticated for a service and activates the credential storage feature. During subsequent accesses from another device portal application to the fitness tracking service the stored credentials at the home router may be used to authenticate any iPhone application Android application and websites on both Safari iMac and Chrome on the two Windows laptops thereby solving the problem of synchronizing user actions across a variety of access points for the same service. For example multiple household users using the fitness tracking service on their phone to track run distances will have several different ways to interact with the information once their workout is complete. The data generated by the phone can calculate a run distance that is tied authenticated to the user s account but in cases where a mobile application has a different functionality compared to the full website functionality provided to a desktop device. When the user returns home after the workout to interact with the workout data on their computer the requirement for recalling and re entering their credentials again is eliminated by having the credentials stored on the home router. This home network credential storage feature is especially advantageous in a multi device multi platform multi user environment where credential logins would otherwise be required for each access device platform and portal used to interact with the service. By storing or caching application website service credentials at a router for sharing by different devices which use the router to access a network service there is no need to manage heavy weight session data resources at the client devices or web service devices or to otherwise store credentials in a distributed manner across multiple client or server devices.

By now it will be appreciated that there is disclosed herein a system method apparatus and computer program product for sharing access to a network service by multiple devices in a home network with an information handling system having a processor and a memory. As disclosed the system method apparatus and computer program product may be implemented in an information handling system embodied as a home gateway router which receives a first user request from a first client device to access a network service along with one or more user credentials from the first client device for authenticating access to the network service. Examples of user credentials include but are not limited to user identification and login information for the network service. Upon validation of the user credentials by the network service the system associates the user credentials with the network service and stores the user credentials from the first client device in memory. Before storing user credentials at the home gateway router the first user at the first client device may be prompted to enter a credential store access passphrase. In addition the system may prompt the first user at the first client device with a message requesting permission to store the one or more credentials at the home gateway router. In selected embodiments the user credentials are encrypted into an encrypted file and stored as an encrypted file in a subdirectory of the memory associated with the network service while in other embodiments the user credentials are stored as a cookie in a subdirectory of the memory associated with the network service. With the user credentials stored at the information handling system a second user request from a second client device to access the network service is received and processed at the system by retrieving from memory the user credentials for direct delivery to and authentication by the network service without requiring re entry of the one or more user credentials from the second client device. Thus the stored user credentials are used to share access between a first user request from the first client device is generated by a first portal and application on the first client device and a second user request from the second client device is generated by a second different portal and application on the second client device.

However the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim element by the indefinite articles a or an limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim element to inventions containing only one such element even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases one or more or at least one and indefinite articles such as a or an the same holds true for the use in the claims of definite articles.
