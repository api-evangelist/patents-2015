This application is a continuation of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 858 008 titled Systems and Methods For HTTP Body DOS Attack Prevention With Adaptive Timeout and filed on Apr. 6 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for preventing HTTP Body type denial of service DoS attacks using an adaptive timeout.

In data communication networks client machines may send Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP requests to a server. The HTTP request may include a request for content such as a request for a web page from a web server. Upon receiving an HTTP request the web server may maintain an open communication with the client to receive further requests and serve responses.

Denial of service DoS attacks attempt to make a machine or network resource e.g. a web server unavailable to its intended users e.g. client machines . For example a denial of service attack may cause a web server to become unavailable or slow to respond by saturating the server with external communication requests. These external communication requests may consume the server s resources so that the server can no longer provide its intended service or obstruct the communication media e.g. network between the intended users and the victim so that they can no longer communicate adequately.

A large request body attack is a type of HTTP DoS that tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible. The large request body attack accomplishes this by opening connections to the target web server and sending the large body of the HTTP request in small bits at regular intervals e.g. just before idle timeout keeping the server connections busy for longer durations. Affected servers may keep these connections open filling the server s maximum concurrent connection pool and eventually deny additional connection attempts from clients.

Systems and methods of the present disclosure can facilitate mitigating adverse effects of large HTTP request body attacks. The large request body attack may include relatively small packets at regular intervals relatively large packets at larger intervals or a combination of very small packets and large packets. For example systems and methods of the present disclosure may identify a connection between two computing devices e.g. client and server server and server client and client as being a good connection or a bad connection. The system may adaptively set the HTTP transaction timeout based on whether the connection is a good connection or a bad connection. For example the system may assign a good connection a relatively longer time to complete while the system may allow a bad connection to time out relatively quickly. By adaptively setting the transaction timeout value the system can allow a good connection to complete and reduce the time for a bad connection.

The system may also allow a connection to settle down before taking the timeout action. For example a connection that may appear to be an attack initially due to various reasons e.g. network congestion or client application behavior may not be timed out immediately. Instead the system may initially degrade the parameter value. When the connection restores its normal behavior the parameter values may also be restored thus allowing the connection to complete without timing out.

The system may use various parameters to facilitate identifying whether a connection is behaving well or showing signs of being an attack. If a parameter is indicative of an attack the system may increase an attack counter and if a parameter is indicative of a good connection the system may decrement the attack counter. The system may then compare the attack count with an attack threshold to determine whether the connection is good or bad. The system may initially use a pre set transaction timeout value which the system can dynamically alter to adapt to good or bad connections.

Exemplary parameters the system may use to identify the type of connection may include one or more of the payload length e.g. size of the user data or actual data being sent minus headers attached for transport maximum segment size MSS e.g. a parameter in the Transmission Control Protocol TCP that specifies the largest amount of data that can be received in a single TCP segment inter packet delay e.g. time delay between successive data packets required by the network and round trip time RTT e.g. ping time or the length of time it takes for a signal to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to be received .

The system can analyze parameters in various ways to identify whether a connection is good or an attack in order to update the timeout value. For example when the packet arrives the system can compare the packet size with the MSS. In an illustrative example if the packet size is less than one fourth the MSS the system may determine that the packet size is very small which may be indicative of an attack. Accordingly the system may increment the attack count of the connection by two.

The system may also check the inter packet delay between the current and the previous packet. If the inter packet delay is more than three times the RTT the system may determine that the inter packet delay is slow which may be indicative of an attack. Accordingly the system may increment the attack count by two.

The system may then compare the attack count with an attack threshold. If the attack count is greater than the attack threshold the system may decrease the transaction timeout value by half and then reset the attack count.

The system may also identify that a connection is good based on the packet size and inter packet delay comparisons. For example if the packet size is not less than one fourth the MSS and the inter packet delay between the current and the previous packet is not more than three times the RTT the system may decrement the attack count by one. If the system identifies that the attack count is less than the negative of the attack threshold e.g. attack count

The system may then use the updated transaction timeout value to determine whether the connection has timed out. If the connection has timed out the system can take a corresponding timeout action e.g. dropping the connection silently sending a RESET or other responder action . If a timeout has not occurred the system may continue packet processing.

In some aspects the present disclosure is directed to a method for changing an application layer transaction timeout to prevent Denial of Service DOS attacks. In some embodiments the method includes receiving by a device intermediary to a client and a server a packet of an application layer transaction. The device may receive the packet via a transport layer connection between the device and the client. The transport layer connection may have a maximum segment size. The method may include incrementing by the device an attack counter for the transport layer connection. The device may increment the counter by a first predetermined amount when the size of the packet is less than a predetermined fraction of the maximum segment size for the transport layer connection. The method may include incrementing by the device the attack counter for the transport layer connection by a second predetermined amount. The device may increment the counter by the second predetermined amount when the inter packet delay between the packet and a previous packet is more than a predetermined multiplier of a round trip time. The method may include changing by the device a timeout for the application layer transaction. The device may change the timeout responsive to comparing the attack counter to a predetermined threshold.

Products such as those of software and networking vendors that rely on CPUs for performance gains may improve their performance by leveraging these multi core CPUs. The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and or rewritten to take advantage of a multi threaded parallel architecture or otherwise a multi core architecture.

A multi core architecture of the appliance referred to as nCore or multi core technology allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi core CPUs. In the previous architecture described in connection with a single network or packet engine is run. The multiple cores of the nCore technology and architecture allow multiple packet engines to run concurrently and or in parallel. With a packet engine running on each core the appliance architecture leverages the processing capacity of additional cores. In some embodiments this provides up to a 7 increase in performance and scalability.

Illustrated in are some embodiments of work task load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme such as functional parallelism data parallelism or flow based data parallelism. In brief overview illustrates embodiments of a multi core system such as an appliance with n cores a total of cores numbers through N. In one embodiment work load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A a second core B a third core C a fourth core D a fifth core E a sixth core F a seventh core G and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N hereinafter referred to collectively as cores . There may be multiple VIPs each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different varying or similar work load or performance level across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine a VIP or appliance . In a data parallelism approach data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card NIC or VIP receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.

In further detail to in some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance.

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hast result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask.

In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

As discussed in the previous section to overcome limitations on transistor spacing and CPU speed increases many CPU manufacturers have incorporated multi core CPUs to improve performance beyond that capable of even a single higher speed CPU. Similar or further performance gains may be made by operating a plurality of appliances either single or multi core together as a distributed or clustered appliance. Individual computing devices or appliances may be referred to as nodes of the cluster. A centralized management system may perform load balancing distribution configuration or other tasks to allow the nodes to operate in conjunction as a single computing system. Externally or to other devices including servers and clients in many embodiments the cluster may be viewed as a single virtual appliance or computing device albeit one with performance exceeding that of a typical individual appliance.

Referring now to illustrated is an embodiment of a computing device cluster or appliance cluster . A plurality of appliances or other computing devices sometimes referred to as nodes such as desktop computers servers rackmount servers blade servers or any other type and form of computing device may be joined into a single appliance cluster . Although referred to as an appliance cluster in many embodiments the cluster may operate as an application server network storage server backup service or any other type of computing device without limitation. In many embodiments the appliance cluster may be used to perform many of the functions of appliances WAN optimization devices network acceleration devices or other devices discussed above.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a homogenous set of computing devices such as identical appliances blade servers within one or more chassis desktop or rackmount computing devices or other devices. In other embodiments the appliance cluster may comprise a heterogeneous or mixed set of devices including different models of appliances mixed appliances and servers or any other set of computing devices. This may allow for an appliance cluster to be expanded or upgraded over time with new models or devices for example.

In some embodiments each computing device or appliance of an appliance cluster may comprise a multi core appliance as discussed above. In many such embodiments the core management and flow distribution methods discussed above may be utilized by each individual appliance in addition to the node management and distribution methods discussed herein. This may be thought of as a two tier distributed system with one appliance comprising and distributing data to multiple nodes and each node comprising and distributing data for processing to multiple cores. Accordingly in such embodiments the node distribution system need not manage flow distribution to individual cores as that may be taken care of by a master or control core as discussed above.

In many embodiments an appliance cluster may be physically grouped such as a plurality of blade servers in a chassis or plurality of rackmount devices in a single rack but in other embodiments the appliance cluster may be distributed in a plurality of chassis plurality of racks plurality of rooms in a data center plurality of data centers or any other physical arrangement. Accordingly the appliance cluster may be considered a virtual appliance grouped via common configuration management and purpose rather than a physical group.

In some embodiments an appliance cluster may be connected to one or more networks . For example referring briefly back to in some embodiments an appliance may be deployed between a network joined to one or more clients and a network joined to one or more servers . An appliance cluster may be similarly deployed to operate as a single appliance. In many embodiments this may not require any network topology changes external to appliance cluster allowing for ease of installation and scalability from a single appliance scenario. In other embodiments an appliance cluster may be similarly deployed as shown in or discussed above. In still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a plurality of virtual machines or processes executed by one or more servers. For example in one such embodiment a server farm may execute a plurality of virtual machines each virtual machine configured as an appliance and a plurality of the virtual machines acting in concert as an appliance cluster . In yet still other embodiments an appliance cluster may comprise a mix of appliances or virtual machines configured as appliances . In some embodiments appliance cluster may be geographically distributed with the plurality of appliances not co located. For example referring back to in one such embodiment a first appliance may be located at a first site such as a data center and a second appliance may be located at a second site such as a central office or corporate headquarters. In a further embodiment such geographically remote appliances may be joined by a dedicated network such as a T1 or T3 point to point connection a VPN or any other type and form of network. Accordingly although there may be additional communications latency compared to co located appliances there may be advantages in reliability in case of site power failures or communications outages scalability or other benefits. In some embodiments latency issues may be reduced through geographic or network based distribution of data flows. For example although configured as an appliance cluster communications from clients and servers at the corporate headquarters may be directed to the appliance deployed at the site load balancing may be weighted by location or similar steps can be taken to mitigate any latency.

Still referring to an appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a client data plane . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between clients and appliance cluster . In some embodiments client data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In some embodiments this router or switch may be referred to as an interface manager and may further be configured to distribute traffic evenly across the nodes in the application cluster . Thus in many embodiments the interface master may comprise a flow distributor external to appliance cluster . In other embodiments the interface master may comprise one of appliances . For example a first appliance may serve as the interface master receiving incoming traffic for the appliance cluster and distributing the traffic across each of appliances . In some embodiments return traffic may similarly flow from each of appliances via the first appliance serving as the interface master. In other embodiments return traffic from each of appliances may be transmitted directly to a network or via an external router switch or other device. In some embodiments appliances of the appliance cluster not serving as an interface master may be referred to as interface slaves.

The interface master may perform load balancing or traffic flow distribution in any of a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments the interface master may comprise a router performing equal cost multi path ECMP routing with next hops configured with appliances or nodes of the cluster. The interface master may use an open shortest path first OSPF In some embodiments the interface master may use a stateless hash based mechanism for traffic distribution such as hashes based on IP address or other packet information tuples as discussed above. Hash keys and or salt may be selected for even distribution across the nodes. In other embodiments the interface master may perform flow distribution via link aggregation LAG protocols or any other type and form of flow distribution load balancing and routing.

In some embodiments the appliance cluster may be connected to a network via a server data plane . Similar to client data plane server data plane may comprise a communication network such as a network carrying data between servers and appliance cluster . In some embodiments server data plane may comprise a switch hub router or other network devices bridging an external network and the plurality of appliances of the appliance cluster . For example in one such embodiment a router may be connected to an external network and connected to a network interface of each appliance . In many embodiments each appliance may comprise multiple network interfaces with a first network interface connected to client data plane and a second network interface connected to server data plane . This may provide additional security and prevent direct interface of client and server networks by having appliance cluster server as an intermediary device. In other embodiments client data plane and server data plane may be merged or combined. For example appliance cluster may be deployed as a non intermediary node on a network with clients and servers . As discussed above in many embodiments an interface master may be deployed on the server data plane for routing and distributing communications from the servers and network to each appliance of the appliance cluster. In many embodiments an interface master for client data plane and an interface master for server data plane may be similarly configured performing ECMP or LAG protocols as discussed above.

In some embodiments each appliance in appliance cluster may be connected via an internal communication network or back plane . Back plane may comprise a communication network for inter node or inter appliance control and configuration messages and for inter node forwarding of traffic. For example in one embodiment in which a first appliance communicates with a client via network and a second appliance communicates with a server via network communications between the client and server may flow from client to first appliance from first appliance to second appliance via back plane and from second appliance to server and vice versa. In other embodiments back plane may carry configuration messages such as interface pause or reset commands policy updates such as filtering or compression policies status messages such as buffer status throughput or error messages or any other type and form of inter node communication. In some embodiments RSS keys or hash keys may be shared by all nodes in the cluster and may be communicated via back plane . For example a first node or master node may select an RSS key such as at startup or boot and may distribute this key for use by other nodes. In some embodiments back plane may comprise a network between network interfaces of each appliance and may comprise a router switch or other network device not illustrated . Thus in some embodiments and as discussed above a router for client data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network a router for server data plane may be deployed between appliance cluster and network and a router for back plane may be deployed as part of appliance cluster . Each router may connect to a different network interface of each appliance . In other embodiments one or more planes may be combined or a router or switch may be split into multiple LANs or VLANs to connect to different interfaces of appliances and serve multiple routing functions simultaneously to reduce complexity or eliminate extra devices from the system.

In some embodiments a control plane not illustrated may communicate configuration and control traffic from an administrator or user to the appliance cluster . In some embodiments the control plane may be a fourth physical network while in other embodiments the control plane may comprise a VPN tunnel or communication via one of planes . Thus the control plane may in some embodiments be considered a virtual communication plane. In other embodiments an administrator may provide configuration and control through a separate interface such as a serial communication interface such as RS 232 a USB communication interface or any other type and form of communication. In some embodiments an appliance may comprise an interface for administration such as a front panel with buttons and a display a web server for configuration via network or back plane or any other type and form of interface.

In some embodiments as discussed above appliance cluster may include internal flow distribution. For example this may be done to allow nodes to join leave transparently to external devices. To prevent an external flow distributor from needing to be repeatedly reconfigured on such changes a node or appliance may act as an interface master or distributor for steering network packets to the correct node within the cluster . For example in some embodiments when a node leaves the cluster such as on failure reset or similar cases an external ECMP router may identify the change in nodes and may rehash all flows to redistribute traffic. This may result in dropping and resetting all connections. The same drop and reset may occur when the node rejoins. In some embodiments for reliability two appliances or nodes within appliance cluster may receive communications from external routers via connection mirroring.

In many embodiments flow distribution among nodes of appliance cluster may use any of the methods discussed above for flow distribution among cores of an appliance. For example in one embodiment a master appliance master node or interface master may compute a RSS hash such as a Toeplitz hash on incoming traffic and consult a preference list or distribution table for the hash. In many embodiments the flow distributor may provide the hash to the recipient appliance when forwarding the traffic. This may eliminate the need for the node to recompute the hash for flow distribution to a core. In many such embodiments the RSS key used for calculating hashes for distribution among the appliances may comprise the same key as that used for calculating hashes for distribution among the cores which may be referred to as a global RSS key allowing for reuse of the calculated hash. In some embodiments the hash may be computed with input tuples of transport layer headers including port numbers internet layer headers including IP addresses or any other packet header information. In some embodiments packet body information may be utilized for the hash. For example in one embodiment in which traffic of one protocol is encapsulated within traffic of another protocol such as lossy UDP traffic encapsulated via a lossless TCP header the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the encapsulated protocol e.g. UDP headers rather than the encapsulating protocol e.g. TCP headers . Similarly in some embodiments in which packets are encapsulated and encrypted or compressed the flow distributor may calculate the hash based on the headers of the payload packet after decryption or decompression. In still other embodiments nodes may have internal IP addresses such as for configuration or administration purposes. Traffic to these IP addresses need not be hashed and distributed but rather may be forwarded to the node owning the destination address. For example an appliance may have a web server or other server running for configuration or administration purposes at an IP address of 1.2.3.4 and in some embodiments may register this address with the flow distributor as it s internal IP address. In other embodiments the flow distributor may assign internal IP addresses to each node within the appliance cluster . Traffic arriving from external clients or servers such as a workstation used by an administrator directed to the internal IP address of the appliance 1.2.3.4 may be forwarded directly without requiring hashing.

Systems and methods of the present disclosure can facilitate mitigating adverse effects of denial of service DOS attacks. For example an HTTP DOS attack such as a large request body attack may include an attack on a server that fills the maximum concurrent connection pool of the server thereby causing the server to deny additional connection attempts from other computing devices. The systems and methods of the present disclosure can identify good connections e.g. connections from actual users and bad connections e.g. a DOS attack in order to facilitate completing good connections and terminating or resetting bad connections. Upon identifying a good or bad connection systems and methods of the present disclosure can adaptively adjust a transaction timeout value such that legitimate connections can complete properly and connections that are conducting a DOS attack are can be eliminated thereby mitigating the adverse effects of an HTTP DOS attack.

In some embodiments the system can obtain various parameters associated with a connection between a server and a computing device e.g. a client machine server or other computing device configured to establish a connection with the server . Based on an analysis of one or more parameters associated with a received segment or packet associated with the connection the system can identify the connection as being used for its intended purpose or being used to conduct an attack and accordingly increase or decrease an attack counter. If the attack counter exceeds an attack threshold the system may determine that the connection is likely being used to conduct an attack. The system may then decrease the transaction timeout value associated with the connection so a timeout action is taken sooner. If on the other hand the attack counter has decreased below a negative attack threshold value the system may determine that the connection is likely being used to conduct an actual transaction. The system may then increase the transaction timeout value associated with the connection so the transaction is more likely to complete properly.

In an illustrative example the system may use a maximum segment size MSS parameter and a round trip time RTT parameter associated with a transport layer connection between a server and a client. In some embodiments when a packet arrives the system may compare the payload size of the packet with the MSS to identify whether the connection is likely being used to conduct an attack. In some embodiments when a packet arrives the system may identify an inter packet delay and compare the inter packet delay with the RTT to identify whether the connection is likely being used to conduct an attack. If the system determines that the connection is likely being used to conduct an attack the system can increase the attack count. If the system determines that the connection is not likely being used to conduct an attack then the system can decrease the attack count. Based on the attack count the system may increase decrease or not adjust the transaction timeout value which can facilitate properly conducting a transaction or mitigating a DOS attack.

Referring to a block diagram of an embodiment of a system for mitigating DOS attacks using an adaptive timeout is shown. In brief overview an intermediary device such as an appliance multi core appliance and or node of a cluster may provide a plurality of services for mitigating DOS attacks on a server including but not limited to services provided and or facilitated by an inter packet delay module packet size module adaptive timeout module attack counter HTTP DOS prevention module an application firewall App FW and HTTP profile module . The appliance may be intermediary to a client executing a client agent and a server executing a service . The appliance may communicate with a server via network and with client via network . For example a client may forward transmit or otherwise submit a packet or segment via a transport layer connection between the client and device . In some embodiments the packet may be intercepted by intermediary device while in other embodiments the packet may be received by server and forwarded to appliance . When the packet arrives at the device the device may perform one or more function or analyze information associated with the packet to determine if the client may be interacting with server for the server s intended purpose or if the client may be conducting a DOS attack. Based on the determination the device may facilitate an actual connection completing properly while terminating or resetting connection that are being used to conduct a DOS attack.

The inter packet delay packet size adaptive timeout attack counter HTTP DOS prevention module application firewall App FW and HTTP profile can each include at least one processing unit or other logic device such as programmable logic array engine or module configured to communicate with an aspect of the appliance client and or server . The inter packet delay packet size adaptive timeout attack counter HTTP DOS prevention application firewall App FW and HTTP profile can be separate components a single component or part of the device .

In some embodiments a plurality of clients can execute or run any type of client agent or application that is configured to generate or transmit data or communicate via a transport layer connection via a network . In some embodiments the client may communicate via a transmission control protocol TCP . TCP may accept data from a data stream segment the data into chunks and add a TCP header creating a TCP segment. The TCP segment may then be encapsulated into an Internet Protocol IP datagram. The TCP segment may be referred to as a packet of information that TCP uses to exchange data with appliance and or server . The TCP segment may include a segment header and a data section e.g. the payload data carried for the application being executed by the client . The TCP header may include 10 fields and an optional extension field. For example the 10 fields may include fields for identifying a sending port a receiving port a sequence number acknowledgment number a data offset reserved bits control bits a window size a checksum and or an urgent pointer. Optional fields may include an option kind option length and or option data containing the value of the option. Options may include end of options list no operation maximum segment size window scale selective acknowledgment timestamp and echo of previous time stamp TCP alternate checksum request and or TCP alternate checksum data.

In some embodiments the appliance includes an application firewall for communications between one or more clients and one or more servers . As discussed above in relation to the application firewall can protect against denial of service DoS attacks apply policies for providing protections against various classes and types of web or Internet based vulnerabilities protect confidential information contained in the network communication and or inspect or analyze any network communication in accordance with rules or polices.

In some embodiments the application firewall is configured to apply an HTTP transaction timeout value to an application layer transaction. The HTTP transaction timeout value can be initially set via the HTTP profile or include an adaptive timeout . If the application firewall determines that the duration of the application layer transaction exceeds the HTTP transaction timeout value the application firewall may trigger a transaction timeout action. The transaction timeout action can be obtained from the HTTP profile and include e.g. dropping the connection with the client resetting the connection with client or initiating a script or function.

In some embodiments the appliance includes an HTTP DoS attack preventer . The DOS attack preventer can apply one or more polices or rules to determine whether a network connection is likely to be a DoS attack and then facilitate mitigating preventing or eliminating the attack. The HTTP DoS attack preventer can obtain information from or utilize one or more component of the appliance or a resource accessible via network . For example the attack preventer can obtain an inter packet delay value from the inter packet delay module a packet size value from the packet size module maintain an attack count in attack counter obtain a timeout value from adaptive timeout module and obtain a request timeout value and timeout action from the HTTP profile . In some embodiments the attack preventer can obtain an RTT value and an MSS value from one or more component and or determine an RTT and or MSS value from a received packet.

In some embodiments when the appliance receives a packet the attack preventer may be configured to compare a payload size of the packet with the MSS of the connection. For example the attack preventer may be configured to compare the packet size with a predetermined fraction of the MSS. In some embodiments the predetermined fraction can be a fixed value set by an administrator of appliance server or service . In an illustrative example the predetermined fraction may be a fifth a quarter a third a half or any other fraction or percentage of MSS that may facilitate identifying an HTTP large request body DoS attack or a connection that is behaving well.

If the attack preventer determines that the payload size of the packet is less than the predetermined fraction of the MSS the attack preventer may be configured to cause the attack counter to increment by a certain amount. For example the attack counter may increment by 1 2 3 4 or any other amount to indicate that an aspect of the application layer transaction is indicative of a DoS attack. In some embodiments the attack preventer may cause the attack counter to increment if the payload size of the packet is less than or equal to the predetermined fraction of the MSS.

If on the other hand the attack preventer determines that the payload length is not less than or not less than or equal to the fraction of the MSS the attack counter may not increment. In some embodiments if the payload length is greater than a fraction or equal to the MSS the attack preventer may cause the attack counter to decrement. For example if the payload length is greater than 75 85 90 or 95 the MSS the attack preventer may decrement the attack counter.

In some embodiments when the appliance receives a packet the attack preventer may be configured to compare an inter packet delay with a RTT value. For example the attack preventer may be configured to compare the inter packet delay with a predetermined multiplier of the RTT. In some embodiments the predetermined multiplier can be a fixed value set by an administrator of appliance server or service . In an illustrative example the predetermined multiplier may be one two three four five or any other multiplier of the RTT that may facilitate identifying an HTTP large request body DoS attack or a connection that is behaving well.

If the attack preventer determines that the inter packet delay between the current packet and the previous packet is greater than or greater than or equal to the predetermined multiple of the RTT the attack preventer may be configured to cause the attack counter to increment by a certain amount. For example the attack counter may increment by one two three four or any other amount to indicate that an aspect of the application layer transaction is indicative of a DoS attack.

If on the other hand the attack preventer determines that the inter packet delay is not greater than or not greater than or equal to a multiple of the RTT the attack counter may not increment. In some embodiments if the inter packet delay is less than a multiple or equal to the RTT the attack preventer may cause the attack counter to decrement. For example if the inter packet delay is the RTT the attack preventer may decrement the attack counter.

In some embodiments if the payload length of the packet is less than a fraction of the MSS and or the inter packet delay is greater than a multiple of the RTT the attack preventer may be configured to decrement the attack counter by a predetermined amount. In some embodiments the attack preventer may decrement the attack counter only if both the payload length of the packet is less than a fraction of the MSS and the inter packet delay is greater than a multiple of the RTT. For example the attack preventer may cause the attack counter to decrement by one two three four or any other amount to indicate that the connection is behaving well e.g. the connection is likely not an HTTP DoS attack . In some embodiments the attack preventer may reset the attack counter or assign a predetermined attack count.

In some embodiments the attack preventer may be designed and constructed to adjust the increment amount of the attack counter responsive to the payload length and or inter packet delay comparison or another aspect of the connection. In some embodiments the attack preventer can adjust the increment amount of the attack counter proportional to the payload length and or inter packet delay. For example if the payload length is less than 10 of the MSS the attack preventer may increment the attack counter by 3. In another example if the inter packet delay is more than five times the RTT the attack preventer may increment the attack counter by 3.

In some embodiments the attack preventer may be configured to compare the current attack count with an attack count threshold. In some embodiments the attack preventer may compare the attack count with the attack threshold on a per packet basis. In some embodiments the attack preventer may only compare the attack count with the attack threshold when the attack count is increased which may correspond to when an attack flag is set to true for a packet e.g. the attack flag may be set to true when the payload length of the packet is less than a fraction of the MSS and or the inter packet delay is greater than a multiple of the RTT .

In some embodiments the attack preventer may be designed and constructed to adaptively adjust the HTTP transaction time responsive to the comparison of the attack count with the attack count threshold. For example the attack preventer can be configured to reduce the transaction timeout if the attack preventer determines that an aspect of the application layer transaction is indicative of a DoS attack. In another example the attack preventer can be configured to increase the transaction timeout if an aspect of the application layer transaction is indicative of a good connection that is being used for its intended purpose.

In some embodiments if the attack count is greater than the attack count threshold the attack preventer may cause the adaptive timeout module to adjust the HTTP transaction timeout value. In some embodiments the attack preventer may adjust the transaction timeout value if the attack count is greater than or equal to the attack count threshold. For example the transaction timeout value may be reduced by 10 25 50 75 etc. In some embodiments the transaction timeout value may be set to a predetermined value responsive to the attack count exceeding an attack count threshold e.g. 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 etc. . In some embodiments the amount the transaction timeout is reduced can be proportional to or otherwise based on the attack count. For example if the attack count exceeds the attack threshold by 1 the transaction timeout can be reduced by 25 if the attack count exceeds the attack threshold by 2 the transaction timeout can be reduced by 50 if the attack count exceeds the attack threshold by 4 the transaction time can be reduced by 75 . In some embodiments the attack counter can be reset to zero or another default value when the transaction timeout is decreased.

In some embodiments if the attack count is less than the attack count threshold the attack preventer may cause the adaptive timeout module to adjust the HTTP transaction timeout value. In some embodiments the attack preventer may adjust the transaction timeout value if the attack count is less than or equal to the attack count threshold. For example if the attack count is less than a negative of the attack count threshold used to determine whether to decrease the transaction timeout value the attack preventer may cause the transaction timeout to be increased. If the attack count threshold is four then the negative of the attack count threshold is negative four. The transaction timeout may be increased by a percentage doubled tripled etc. In some embodiments the transaction timeout may be increased proportional to the attack count. For example if the attack count is less than the negative of the attack threshold minus 2 the transaction timeout may be doubled if the attack count is less than the attack threshold minus 3 the transaction timeout may be tripled. In some embodiments if the transaction timeout is increased the attack count may be reset to zero or some other default value.

In some embodiments the attack preventer may trigger a timeout action associated with an HTTP profile if the elapsed time of the application layer transaction of a client exceeds the current transaction timeout value. The current transaction timeout may be the adaptively set transaction timeout value if adaptive timeout adjustment is enabled in the HTTP profile . In another example if the elapsed time is not greater than the transaction timeout the device may forward the packet to the server or otherwise process the packet in order to e.g. respond to the HTTP request of the client .

In some embodiments the appliance includes an HTTP profile designed and constructed to obtain and or log information to facilitate mitigating DOS attacks including e.g. information associated with a transport layer connection server configuration client and or server . In some embodiments the HTTP profile information may include e.g. a pre set initial transaction timeout value a timeout action and or an option to enable or disable adaptive timeout. In some embodiments the HTTP profile may include various parameters or values the appliance may use to mitigate DOS attacks. For example the HTTP profile may include a default or initial value for an attack counter a first predetermined amount by which the attack counter may increment responsive to a comparison with the MSS a predetermined fraction to be used in the MSS comparison a second predetermined amount by which the attack counter may increment responsive to a comparison with an inter packet delay a predetermined multiplier to be used in a RTT comparison and or a threshold value to be used in a comparison with an attack counter value. In some embodiments one or more parameters or values may be set by a server service appliance an operator of a server service appliance or other entity. In some embodiments a user may set one or more parameters or values via a user interface of the server or appliance . In an illustrative example a user of appliance may set a request timeout value and corresponding timeout action of the HTTP profile using the following command code or configuration 

In this example a user may indicate a name for the profile a timeout value in seconds and the corresponding timeout action. The initial request timeout value can be a static timeout applied directly on the flow of the application layer transaction between the client and server and may include a fixed number of seconds or be a fixed multiplier of some other network parameter such as a RTT value ping value etc. For example the initial request timeout value can be 10 seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds 60 seconds 120 seconds 180 seconds 300 seconds etc. The timeout action specifies the action to be taken when timeout occurs and may include e.g. dropping the connection silently sending a RESET and or other action. In some embodiments the appliance may be configured to run a script or perform some other function upon a timeout event such as store information associated with the client that triggered the timeout alert or prompt an administrator of the appliance or server log the timeout event and information associated with the timeout event etc.

In some embodiments an administrator may enable or disable the adaptive timeout functionality of appliance . Adaptive timeout may be enabled or disabled by default. In some embodiments adaptive timeout may be automatically enabled responsive to the appliance identifying an event. For example the appliance may automatically enable the adaptive timeout functionality upon the appliance identifying that a server or service has succumbed to a DOS attack. In some embodiments the appliance may enable or disabled adaptive timeout responsive to receiving a request from server or service . In some embodiments the appliance may enable or disable adaptive timeout functionality based factors associated with the client device e.g. geographic location time of day service being requested IP address etc. . In an illustrative example an administrator of appliance may use the following pseudo code to enable or disable the adaptive timeout functionality of appliance 

In this example the administrator may enter the profile name and indicate whether to enable or disable the adaptive timeout functionality. The profile name may correspond to a request timeout value in seconds and a corresponding timeout action. In some embodiments the user may have created the profile and profile name. In some embodiments the appliance may be preconfigured with the one or more profiles and profile names. If adaptive timeout is enabled the appliance may increase or decrease the timeout value internally and apply an updated timeout value to the flow of the application layer transaction between the client and server .

In some embodiments the appliance includes an attack counter configured to increase or decrease an attack count responsive to an indication from the attack preventer to increase decrease the attack count. In some embodiments the attack counter is configured to maintain an attack count for each connection between a client and appliance and or server . In some embodiments the attack counter is configured to maintain an attack count for each client agent . In some embodiments the attack counter can maintain an attack count for a client running multiple applications that have opened multiple connections with appliance and or server . For example a single client may execute multiple applications in order to conduct an HTTP large request body DoS attack on server . Each application may attempt to keep a connection with the server open for as long as possible by slowly sending small chunks of the HTTP body.

In some embodiments the appliance includes an adaptive timeout module designed and constructed to maintain an adaptive timeout value for a connection between a client and the appliance and or server . In some embodiments the adaptive timeout module is configured to maintain a transaction timeout value for each client . In some embodiments the adaptive timeout module is configured to maintain a transaction timeout value for each client agent . In some embodiments the adaptive timeout module can maintain a transaction timeout value for a client running multiple applications that have opened multiple connections with appliance and or server .

The adaptive timeout module may be enabled or disabled via the HTTP profile . In some embodiments the adaptive timeout module can be pre set with an initial HTTP transaction timeout value e.g. the initial transaction timeout value set in the HTTP profile . In some embodiments the adaptive timeout module may adjust the initial transaction timeout value based on various factors. For example if the appliance detects that a DoS is being conducted then the initial transaction timeout value for all future connections may be decreased. In some embodiments if the appliance detects that a DoS attack is not currently being conducted then the initial transaction timeout value may be at a default value or increased.

In some embodiments the appliance includes a packet size module designed and constructed to determine the size of a packet and or payload length that arrives at the appliance . In some embodiments the packet size module may determine the size of the entire TCP IP packet. In some embodiments the packet size module may determine the size of the TCP packet. In some embodiments the packet size module may determine the payload length only e.g. the user data . The packet size module may determine the payload length by subtracting the combined length of the TCP header and the encapsulating IP header from the total IP datagram length which may be indicated in the IP header. For example the IP header may include a Total Length field that indicates the length of the entire IP packet in bytes. The packet size module may then determine the size of the TCP packet by subtracting the number of 32 bit words that make up the header e.g. indicated by a Header Length in the IP header . The packet size module may then determine the size of the data in the packet e.g. the payload length by subtracting the size of the TCP header from the size of the TCP packet. The packet size module may determine the size of the TCP header by using a Data Offset field in the TCP header which may indicate the size of the TCP header in 32 bit words.

In some embodiments the appliance may obtain or determine the MSS associated with the application layer connection. The MSS may be indicated by the server and or appliance when the client attempts to initiate a connection. In some embodiments a parameter of the TCP protocol may specify the MSS in octets. For example the MSS option may be established by the operating system on the SYN packet during a TCP handshake between a client and sever and or appliance . The appliance may obtain the MSS value from the TCP SYN and SYN ACK packets associated with the connection. In some embodiments the MSS may be larger than a default MSS value while in other embodiments the MSS may be smaller than the default value. The MSS may count data octets in the segment relating to the payload which may not include the TCP header or the IP header. For example the TCP header may include an option for indicating the maximum segment size. In an illustrative example the MSS of IPv4 hosts may be 536 octets MSS of IPv6 hosts may be 1220 octets.

In some embodiments the appliance may include an inter packet delay module designed and constructed to determine a time delay between a current TCP packet and a previous TCP packet. In some embodiments the inter packet delay module may determine a time different between the current packet and a previous packet by using a TCP timestamp. For example an operating system of the client appliance and or server may increment the TCP timestamp for every elapsed millisecond. In some embodiments the inter packet delay module may obtain the timestamp for a packet from a TCP header option field. The TCP header option field may include a timestamp for a current packet and or an echo of a previous timestamp. In some embodiments the inter packet delay may refer to the difference between a timestamp of a first packet and a timestamp of a second packet. In some embodiments the inter packet delay module may obtain a first timestamp for a first packet and a second timestamp for a second packet and calculate the difference between the two timestamps.

In some embodiments the appliance is designed and constructed to determine a RTT for the connection or a ping time. The RTT may refer to the length of time it takes for a packet to be sent plus the length of time it takes for an acknowledgment of that packet to be received. In some embodiments the RTT may be computed for between the client and appliance . In some embodiments the RTT may be computed for between a server and client . In some embodiments the RTT is based on the connection between the client and the appliance and or server . In some embodiments the RTT is based on a historical average of ping times. For example the ping time may be determined by the appliance and or server upon initiation of a connection with a client . In some embodiments the RTT is fixed for the entire connection. In some embodiments the RTT may vary throughout the connection. For example the RTT may be computed using the following equation RTT Old RTT 1 New Round Trip Sample 

In this equation may refer to a constant weighting factor that ranges from 0 to 1 where a value closer to 1 results in the weighted average being less susceptible to changes that last a short time and a value closer to 0 results in the weighted average responding to changes in delay more quickly. In some embodiments the RTT may take into account a standard deviation.

Referring to a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for preventing HTTP large request body DoS attacks using an adaptive timeout is shown. In brief overview and in some embodiments the method includes receiving by an intermediary device via a transport layer connection with a MSS a packet of an application layer transaction . The method may include the intermediary device incrementing an attack counter responsive to a size of the packet being less than a predetermined fraction of the MSS . In some embodiments the method includes the intermediary device incrementing the attack counter responsive to an inter packet delay being more than a predetermined multiple of a RTT . The method may include changing a transaction timeout for the application layer transaction responsive to comparing the attack counter to a predetermined threshold .

In some embodiments the device receives one or more packets of an application layer transaction . The packet may be received by a device intermediary to a client and a server. The client may transmit the packet which the intermediary device may intercept or receive. In some embodiments the server may receive the packet and forward the packet to the intermediary device. In some embodiments the packet may be received via a transport layer connection between the client and the device such as TCP IP. In some embodiments the device may receive the packet carrying a HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP transaction or portion thereof. For example the transaction may correspond to a client device requesting a web page for display on the client device. The client device may request the web page for display from a web server. In other examples the client device may request any other service that can be provided by a server. In yet other examples the client device may attempt to conduct an HTTP large request body DoS attack on one or more servers. In some embodiments the transport layer connection carrying the application layer transaction may have a maximum segment size MSS . In some embodiments the device receives packets from a device that is causing an HTTP based DOS attack.

In some embodiments the device increments an attack counter for the transport layer connection responsive to a size of the packet being less than a fraction of the MSS. In some embodiments an attack preventer of the device may cause an attack counter to increment. For example the device such as via a packet size module may compare the packet size or packet length with a predetermined fraction of the MSS. The packet length may correspond to the size of the user data of the TCP segment or packet e.g. the size of the packet not including the header . The predetermined fraction of the MSS may be a fifth a fourth a third a half or any other fraction of the MSS that may be indicative of a connection behaving badly e.g. a client using the connection to conduct an HTTP large request body DoS attack . For example an HTTP large request body DoS attack may include transmitting the HTTP large request body to a server in relatively small increments e.g. TCP segments where the size of the user data is smaller than a fraction of the MSS .

In some embodiments if the packet size is less than the fraction of the MSS the method may include incrementing the attack counter by a first predetermined amount. For example the device e.g. via an attack preventer may increment the attack counter by one two three four or any other amount that facilitates mitigating and or preventing DoS attacks. In some embodiments the method includes varying the increment amount based on the packet size. For example if the packet size is less than one fourth the MSS the attack count may increment by 2 if the packet size is less than one fifth the MSS the attack count may increment by 3 if the packet size is less than one sixth the MSS the attack count may increment by 4. In some embodiments the attack counter may have an initial default value of zero.

In some embodiments the device increments the attack counter by a second predetermined amount responsive to an inter packet delay between the packet and a previous packet being more than a multiple of an RTT. The inter packet delay may refer to the timestamp difference between a current packet and a previous packet which may be determined from TCP header information. In some embodiments the method includes determining the RTT from a ping time associated with the connection. In some embodiments the RTT may be based on an average RTT associated with the connection.

In some embodiments the device increments the attack counter by the second predetermined amount if the inter packet delay is more than three times the RTT. In some embodiments an attack preventer of the device may cause the attack the counter to increment. In other embodiments the device e.g. via an inter packet delay module may increment the attack counter if the inter packet delay is 2 3 4 5 or another multiple of the RTT that may be indicative of a connection being used to conduct an HTTP large request body attack e.g. where a client intentionally sends packets slowly in order to keep a connection with a server open for a longer duration . In some embodiments the method includes incrementing the attack counter by 1 2 3 4 or another increment amount to indicate that the connection is likely being used to conduct an attack.

In some embodiments the device such as via an adaptive timeout module changes the timeout for the application layer transaction responsive to comparing the attack counter a predetermined threshold. For example if the attack counter is greater than the predetermined threshold the device may reduce the transaction timeout by half. The predetermined threshold may be any value to facilitate mitigating and or preventing DoS attacks. For example the threshold may be 4 8 12 14 16 etc.

In some embodiments the attack counter may be reset upon changing the transaction timeout value. For example the attack counter may be reset to zero or other initial default value.

In some embodiments the device e.g. via an attack preventer may determine that the connection is behaving well in which case the device allows the connection or transaction to complete properly. To this extent the device may decrement the attack counter upon determining that the packet size is greater than a fraction of the MSS and or the inter packet delay is less than a multiple of the RTT. The attack counter may be decremented by a predetermined decrement such as 1 2 3 4 etc. If the attack count is less than a negative of the threshold e.g. attack count is 6 and negative attack threshold is 4 the device may increase the transaction timeout e.g. doubling tripling quadrupling etc. . The device may reset the attack count upon changing the transaction timeout.

In some embodiments the device e.g. via an application firewall may compare the elapsed time of the application layer transaction with the initial or updated timeout value. If the elapsed time of the application layer transaction is greater than the timeout value the device may drop the connection resetting the connection or taking another timeout action. If the elapsed time is not greater than the transaction timeout the device may for example forward the packet to the server or otherwise process the packet in order to e.g. respond to the HTTP request of the client.

In some embodiments one or more predetermined amounts values increments decrements thresholds and or initial values may be set in an HTTP profile associated with the connection. For example an administrator of the appliance and or server may set one or more parameters used to control the transaction flow.

Referring to a flow chart of an embodiment of a method for preventing HTTP large request body DoS attacks using an adaptive timeout is shown. When the packet arrives at an intermediary device the intermediary device may identify the packet length and compare the packet length with a fraction of the MSS . In this illustrative example if the payload length is less than 25 of the MSS the flow may proceed to step . At step the device may increment the attack counter e.g. by 2 and set an attack flag to a value of TRUE. The flow may proceed to step after or if the payload length was not less than 25 of the MSS the flow may skip step of incrementing the attack counter and proceed directly to step . At step the device may compare the inter packet delay with a multiple of the RTT. In this illustrative example if the inter packet delay is greater than triple the RTT the flow may proceed to step . At step the device may increment the attack counter e.g. by 2 and set an attack flag to a value of TRUE which may already have been set to TRUE by step .

The flow may proceed to step after or if the inter packet delay was not greater than triple the RTT the flow may skip step of incrementing the attack counter and proceed directly to step . At step the device may identify the attack flag. If the attack flag is set to TRUE e.g. via at least one of step and the flow may proceed to step . If the device identifies that the attack flag is true the device may proceed to step where the attack count may be decremented by at least one.

The flow may proceed to step from either step or step . At step the device may evaluate the attack count. If the attack count is greater than an attack count threshold value the device may proceed to step . At step the transaction timeout value of the connection may be decreased by half and the attack counter may be reset to zero. If on the other hand the attack count is less than or equal to the attack threshold the flow may proceed to step .

At step the device may further evaluate the attack count to determine if the attack count is less than a negative of the attack threshold in which case the device may proceed to step . At step the device may increase the transaction timeout by a factor of 2 and reset the attack count to zero. If on the other hand the device determines that the attack count at step is greater than or equal to the negative of the negative attack threshold the device may proceed directly to step .

The device may arrive at step of the flow via step step or step . At step the device may evaluate the elapsed time of the transaction. If the elapsed time of the transaction is greater than the timeout value the device may proceed to step and perform a timeout action. The timeout value may have been adaptively adjusted via the flow or the transaction timeout may still reflect the initial timeout value as indicated in an HTTP profile associated with the connection. However if the elapsed time of the transaction is less than or equal to the transaction timeout the device may proceed to step and process the packet. For example the device may forward the packet to the server or otherwise process the packet in order to e.g. respond to the HTTP request of the client.

In an illustrative example the following pseudo code may facilitate systems and methods of preventing large HTTP request body attacks. The adaptive timeout is initially set to the configured request timeout. In this example the fraction of MSS is 25 the multiple of RTT is 3 the attack counter increments are 2 the decrement amount is 1 and the attack threshold is 14. The transaction timeout is doubled to prevent an attack and the transaction timeout is halved to facilitate completing good transactions.
