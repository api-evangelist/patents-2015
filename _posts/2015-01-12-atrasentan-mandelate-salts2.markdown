The present disclosure relates to atrasentan mandelate salts. As with all pharmaceutical compounds and compositions the chemical and physical properties of atrasentan are important in its commercial development. These properties include but are not limited to 1 packing properties such as molar volume bulk density and hygroscopicity 2 thermodynamic properties such as melting temperature vapor pressure and solubility 3 kinetic properties such as dissolution rate and stability including stability at ambient conditions especially to moisture and under storage conditions 4 surface properties such as surface area wettability interfacial tension and shape 5 mechanical properties such as hardness tensile strength compactibility handling flow and blend and 6 filtration properties. These properties can affect for example the processing and storage of atrasentan and pharmaceutical compositions comprising atrasentan. Salts particularly crystalline salts of atrasentan that improve upon one or more of these properties relative to other salts and or solid state forms of atrasentan are desirable.

The atrasentan dosage forms prepared and administered in clinical trials to date have contained crystalline Form II atrasentan monohydrochloride reported in WO2006 034084 . Form II is the most thermodynamically stable of the three crystalline forms of atrasentan monohydrochloride salts that have been identified i.e. Form I Form II and Form III . Although atrasentan clinical trials have proceeded with crystalline Form II of atrasentan monohydrochloride efforts have continued to identify alternative atrasentan salts that provide further advantages relative to the monohydrochloride salt.

For example one property of the crystalline Form I Form II and Form III atrasentan monohydrochloride salts that could be beneficially improved is crystal morphology. All of the known atrasentan monohydrochloride salts have a needle morphology that can create challenges during the preparation and formulation of such salts. For example the needle morphology results in a relatively low bulk powder density that makes powder handling more difficult during the preparation of the atrasentan dosage form. The needle morphology also increases the difficulty of filtration requiring a longer time in solid liquid separation. These problems reduce the efficiency of the atrasentan purification since the mother liquor will be enriched in impurities increase energy consumption due to removal of excess residual organic solvent in compliance with International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and potentially lead to sintering or caking of the solid that may require an additional milling step.

Another property of the monohydrochloride salt that could be beneficially improved is corrosivity. The preparation of the crystalline Form I Form II and Form III atrasentan monohydrochloride salts requires the use and handling of corrosive hydrochloric acid and typically is carried out in a glass lined reactor rather than a standard stainless steel reactor. In addition during the preparation of the atrasentan monohydrochloride dosage form the monohydrochloride salt can cause corrosion of the tooling such as the punch and die of the tablet press over time. Further the monohydrochloride salt potentially can decompose to yield hydrogen chloride gas over time and or at higher temperatures.

Prior efforts to prepare suitable crystalline forms of atrasentan including crystalline atrasentan parent crystalline atrasentan salts other than hydrochloride salts co crystals and crystalline ionic or molecular adducts have been unsuccessful. Applicant however has now succeeded in preparing and isolating crystalline atrasentan mandelate salts and has discovered that such salts have several advantages over the monohydrochloride salt. The mandelate salts exhibit improved crystal morphology and either have a reduced aspect ratio the ratio of the height of a particle to the cross sectional dimension of a particle and are less needle like or have a plate or prismatic shape. This crystal morphology results in a higher bulk powder density and improved powder handling properties for the mandelate salt. For example a 120 mg tablet containing 0.75 mg of atrasentan will have a drug loading of 0.67 for the hydrochloride salt i.e. 0.8025 mg of the hydrochloride salt per tablet compared to a drug loading of 0.88 for the mandelate salt i.e. 1.05 mg of the mandelate salt per tablet . As the drug loading increases the likelihood of achieving acceptable content uniformity also increases. In addition the improvement in crystal morphology also facilitates solid liquid separation during filtration.

The mandelate salts also represent an improvement over the hydrochloride salts with respect to corrosivity. There is no need to handle corrosive hydrochloric acid during the preparation of the mandelate salt. Further the previously discussed concerns regarding corrosion of tooling and longer term chemical stability associated with the monohydrochloride salt are materially reduced for the mandelate salt.

The atrasentan mandelate salt can be formulated for inhalation or administration nasally. These pharmaceutical formulations can be a spray or aerosol containing an appropriate solvent and optionally other excipients including stabilizers antimicrobial agents antioxidants pH modifiers surfactants bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these. A propellant for an aerosol formulation can include e.g. compressed air nitrogen carbon dioxide or a hydrocarbon based low boiling solvent. The atrasentan mandelate salt can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from a nebulizer or the like.

The atrasentan mandelate salt can be formulated for rectal or intravaginal administration. These formulations can be in the form of a suppository pessary ointment enema a tablet or a cream for release of the atrasentan mandelate salt such as in the intestines sigmoid flexure and or rectum. Rectal suppositories are prepared by mixing an atrasentan mandelate salt of the present invention with an acceptable vehicle e.g. cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol which is present in a solid phase at normal storing temperatures and present in a liquid phase at those temperatures suitable to release a drug inside the body such as in the rectum.

Several studies were conducted to identify new atrasentan salts particularly new crystalline atrasentan salts and are described below.

Solutions of several different organic or inorganic acids in a methanol solvent were prepared for use in the study. These solutions including their concentrations are reported in Table 1 A below.

Each acid methanol solution prepared was added with stirring to a vial containing 25 mg of atrasentan parent dissolved completely in 100 L of methanol. Each addition was carried out at room temperature and the volume of acid methanol solution added to the vial is reported in Table 1 A.

A solid precipitate resulted from the HSO methanol addition. The precipitate was isolated and determined to be an amorphous solid.

A gel like semi solid precipitate resulted from the S mandelic acid methanol addition. The solution containing the precipitate was stirred for at least one week but the precipitate remained a gel like semi solid.

No precipitation was observed for any of the other acid solvent additions. For each addition where no precipitation was observed the vial was covered with parafilm having two pin holes and the solution was allowed to slowly evaporate. An amorphous film was observed in each vial after the solution was completely dried.

Aqueous solutions of several different organic or inorganic acids including a methanol water solution for one acid were prepared for use in the study. These solutions including their concentrations are reported in Table 1 B below.

Each aqueous solution prepared was added with stirring to a vial containing 25 mg of atrasentan parent dissolved completely in 100 L of 2 propanol water 80 20 v v . Each addition was carried out at room temperature and the volume of the aqueous solution added to the vial is reported in Table 1 B.

A solid precipitate resulted from the HSO water addition. The precipitate was isolated as a crystalline solid and determined to be a monohydrate of the atrasentan hemi sulfate salt 1 1 molar ratio of atrasentan to sulfate .

A gel like semi solid precipitate resulted from all of the other aqueous solution additions. Each solution was then heated to 70 C. to re dissolve the semi solid precipitate. In several cases up to 25 L of additional 2 propanol water 80 20 v v was added to the vial as needed to completely re dissolve the semi solid precipitate. After the semi solid precipitate was re dissolved each solution was cooled slowly to room temperature. A gel like semi solid was observed at the bottom of each vial within 10 hours.

Except for the monohydrate of the hemi sulfate salt no other crystalline atrasentan salts were successfully prepared and isolated.

Aqueous solutions of several different organic or inorganic acids or a methanol water solution for one acid and an aqueous solution of nicotinamide were prepared for use in the study. These solutions including their concentrations are reported in Table 1 C below.

About 52 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 1 mL of each aqueous solution prepared and the resulting suspensions were stirred for three to seven days. The solids isolated from each suspension were analyzed and determined to be the atrasentan parent solid.

Aqueous solutions of several different organic or inorganic acids or a methanol water solution for one acid were prepared for use in the study. These solutions including their concentrations are reported in Table 1 D below.

Each aqueous solution prepared was added with stirring to a 4 mL vial containing 50 mg of atrasentan parent in solid form. The additions were carried out at room temperature and the volume of the aqueous solution added to the vial is reported in Table 1 D. The atrasentan only partially dissolved in each aqueous solution. The resulting suspensions were stirred for more than a week. The solids isolated from each suspension were analyzed and determined to be the atrasentan parent. No crystalline atrasentan salts were successfully prepared and isolated.

Atrasentan parent was added to an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The solution turned pink immediately upon the addition of the atrasentan and no sodium salt of atrasentan was isolated. Because atrasentan generally degrades under basic conditions it is believed that the atrasentan degraded in the presence of the sodium hydroxide and was not converted into a sodium salt.

Several additional studies were conducted to prepare and isolate atrasentan S mandelate particularly crystalline atrasentan S mandelate and are described below.

About 25 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 0.2 mL of an aqueous solution of S mandelic acid 0.5 M at room temperature. The suspended solid quickly converted to a gel like semi solid when the solution was stirred. After three days of stirring at room temperature a sample of the suspended semi solid was inspected under microscope and a few birefringent particles were observed.

About 22 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 0.25 mL of methanol water 50 50 v v at room temperature. S Mandelic acid 13.8 mg was added to the suspension. The suspended solids partially dissolved in the S mandelic acid and were converted quickly to a gel like semi solid. The solution was heated to 40 C. and the semi solid was re dissolved. The solution was then slowly cooled to room temperature and produced a solid precipitate. The precipitate was isolated analyzed by PXRD and determined to be a mixture of an anhydrate of atrasentan S mandelate 1 1 stoichiometry and a hemi hydrate of atrasentan parent.

About 100 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 1 mL of methanol water 1 1 v v at room temperature. S Mandelic acid 41 mg was added to the suspension. The majority of the suspended solids dissolved but a gel like semi solid was observed at the bottom of the vial. The suspension was heated to 50 C. but the semi solid remained undissolved. When the suspension was stirred for 10 minutes at 50 C. additional precipitation was observed. When the suspension was stirred overnight the semi solid partially converted to crystalline particles. A sample of the crystalline particles was analyzed by PXRD and determined to be a mixture of an anhydrate of atrasentan S mandelate 1 1 stoichiometry and an anhydrate of atrasentan S mandelate 2 1 stoichiometry . Additional S mandelic acid about 15 mg was added to the suspension with stirring to further convert the semi solid to crystalline particles. The resulting crystalline particles were isolated analyzed by PXRD and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan S mandelate 1 1 stoichiometry . Increasing the amount of S mandelic acid present in the suspension resulted in the conversion of the atrasentan S mandelate 2 1 stoichiometry to atrasentan S mandelate 1 1 stoichiometry .

About 500 mg of atrasentan parent was dissolved in 2.5 mL methanol at room temperature. S Mandelic acid 315 mg was added to the solution. Water was gradually added to the solution in increments of 0.1 mL to reduce solubility and facilitate precipitation . After a total of 1.5 mL of water had been added to the solution precipitation of fine particles was observed. An additional amount of S mandelic acid about 150 mg was added to the suspension after 10 minutes followed by an additional amount of water 1 mL . The suspension was then stirred for three hours. The solids present in the suspension were isolated analyzed by PXRD and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan S mandelate 1 1 stoichiometry .

About 22 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 0.25 mL of a methanol water 1 1 v v mixture in a 1 mL scintillation vial at room temperature with stirring. After 9.8 mg of S mandelic acid had been added to the suspension the atrasentan was completely dissolved and a semi solid agglomerate appeared at the bottom of the vial shortly afterwards. The mixture was stirred continuously overnight and the semi solid agglomerate turned into a white solid that was suspended in the solution. The solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD. The PXRD data indicated the solid was a combination of at least two different crystalline forms.

An excess amount of S mandelic acid was suspended in acetonitrile 1 mL to prepare a saturated S mandelic acid acetonitrile solution. After saturation was achieved the excess S mandelic acid was removed from the solution by filtration. An excess amount of atrasentan S mandelate salt 1 1 stoichiometry was suspended in the S mandelic acid acetonitrile solution at room temperature for three days with stirring. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD about 10 minutes after isolation see Example 8 .

An excess amount of S mandelic acid was suspended in ethanol 1 mL to prepare a saturated S mandelic acid acetonitrile solution. After saturation was achieved the excess S mandelic acid was removed from the solution by filtration. An excess amount of atrasentan S mandelate salt 1 1 stoichiometry was suspended in the S mandelic acid ethanol solution at room temperature for three days with stirring. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD about 10 minutes after isolation see Example 8 .

An excess amount of S mandelic acid was suspended in pyridine 1 mL to prepare a saturated S mandelic acid pyridine solution. After saturation was achieved the excess S mandelic acid was removed from the solution by filtration. An excess amount of atrasentan S mandelate salt 1 1 stoichiometry was suspended in the S mandelic acid ethanol solution at room temperature for three days with stirring. The resulting solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD about 10 minutes after isolation see Example 8 .

100.6 mg of atrasentan parent was suspended in 1 mL of a methanol water 1 1 v v mixture in a 4 mL scintillation vial at 50 C. with stirring. A semi solid agglomerate appeared at the bottom of the vial after 31 mg of S mandelic acid had been added to the suspension. The mixture was stirred continuously for 15 minutes and then the semi solid agglomerate turned into a white solid that was suspended in the solution. The solid was isolated by filtration and analyzed by PXRD see Example 8 . The solid was found to be a hydrate of atrasentan S mandelate salt 2 1 stoichiometry .

About 100 mg of atrasentan parent was added to about 1 mL of an R mandelic acid water solution 0.5 M at room temperature. A gel like precipitate was observed in the resulting suspension. The suspension was sonicated for 15 minutes and heated to 50 C. with stirring. As the suspension was stirred and the temperature maintained at 50 C. the gel like precipitate converted to a white solid. The white solid was isolated dried analyzed by PXRD see Example 8 and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan R mandelate 1 1 stoichiometry .

Atrasentan monohydrochloride 11.42 mg was added to a 2 mL glass vial containing a mixture of n butylamine 100 L and isopropanyl acetate 400 L and dissolved by vortexing. A crystalline solid of was collected after the solvent was removed by evaporation under ambient conditions. The crystalline solid was analyzed by PXRD see Example 8 and determined to be an anhydrate of atrasentan n butylamine 1 1 stoichiometry .

Although the atrasentan n butylamine salt was successfully isolated n butylamine is generally toxic and an n butylamine salt is not a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

The crystal morphology of several different atrasentan salts was assessed by microscopy and the results reported in Table 7 A below.

Several of the atrasentan crystalline forms listed in Table 7 A were analyzed by X ray powder diffraction PXRD . Specifically the PXRD studies were performed on a G3000 diffractometer Inel Corp. Artenay France equipped with a curved position sensitive detector and parallel beam optics. The diffractometer was operated with a copper anode tube 1.5 kW fine focus at 40 kV and 30 mA. An incident beam germanium monochromator provided monochromatic K 1 radiation. The diffractometer was calibrated using the attenuated direct beam at one degree intervals. Calibration was checked using a silicon powder line position reference standard NIST 640c . The sample was loaded onto an aluminum sample holder and leveled with a glass slide. The instrument was computer controlled using the Symphonix software Inel Corp. Artenay France and the data was analyzed using the Jade software version 6.5 Materials Data Inc. Livermore Calif. . All studies were conducted at room temperature i.e. about 25 C. .

Tables 8 A through 8 N set out the significant parameters of the main peaks in terms of 2 values and intensities for the crystalline forms analyzed. It is known in the art that an X ray powder diffraction pattern may be obtained which has one or more measurement errors depending on measurement conditions such as equipment sample preparation or machine used . In particular it is generally known that intensities in an X ray powder diffraction pattern may fluctuate depending on measurement conditions and sample preparation. For example persons skilled in the art of X ray powder diffraction will realize that the relative intensities of peaks may vary according to the orientation of the sample under testing and on the type and setting of the instrument used. The skilled person also will realize that the position of reflections can be affected by the precise height at which the sample sits in the diffractometer and the zero calibration of the diffractometer. The surface planarity of the sample also may have an effect on the results. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the diffraction pattern data presented below is not to be construed as absolute and any crystalline form that provides a power diffraction pattern substantially identical to those disclosed below fall within the scope of the present disclosure for further information see Jenkins R Snyder R. L. Introduction to X Ray Powder Diffractometry John Wiley Sons 1996 .

A study is conducted to evaluate the bulk density tap density and flow properties of atrasentan parent atrasentan mandelate salt and atrasentan hydrochloride salt.

Bulk and tap density are measured following USP . Approximately 60 mL of each sample is added into a 100 mL graduated cylinder. The powder is carefully leveled without compacting and the volume is read directly from the cylinder and used to calculate the bulk density according to the relationship mass volume. The cylinder containing the powder sample is then mechanically tapped using a VanKel Tap Density Tester Model 50 1200 Varian Inc. Palo Alto Calif. until there is no change in volume. The volume of the sample is then read and used in the calculation of tap density.

Flow properties of each sample are characterized using a Schulze ring shear tester RST XS Dietmar Schulze Sch ttgutmesstechnik Wolfenb ttel Germany . A standard annular cell of a cross sectional area of 24 cmand a volume of 30 cmis used to measure the yield loci. All experiments are performed at 23 2 C. and 33 2 relative humidity to minimize the effects of temperature and moisture on flow properties. During each measurement the powder is first pre sheared under a pre consolidation stress until a steady state is reached. The pre sheared powder is then subjected to shear under a normal stress. Thus one shear point of the yield locus a plot of shear stress at failure as a function of the normal stress is obtained. To measure another shear point of the yield locus the sample is then pre sheared again under the same pre consolidation stress and sheared to failure under a subsequently increased normal stress. A complete yield locus is then plotted through all measured shear points.

In this study the procedure is conducted in triplicates with applying pre consolidation stresses of 1 kPa and four normal stress levels equally spaced between 20 to 60 of the pre consolidation stress. From each yield locus major principle stress and unconfined yield strength f are derived by drawing two critical Mohr stress circles with the software RST CONTROL 95 Dietmar Schulze Sch ttgutmesstechnik Wolfenb ttel Germany . The major principle stress results from the Mohr stress circle which is tangential to the yield locus and intersects at the point of normal and shear stresses at steady state flow. The unconfined yield strength f results from the Mohr stress circle which is tangential to the yield locus and runs through the origin. Flow function coefficient FFC f is used to characterize the flow of a powder.

Bulk density and tap density were measured for samples of the following materials i unmilled atrasentan hydrochloride salt having the morphology and particle size distribution listed below in Table 10 and ii unmilled atrasentan mandelate salt having the morphology and particle size distribution listed below in Table 10.

Bulk density was measured in accordance with Bulk Density Method I of USP except that a 100 mL cylinder was filled with the sample for the testing. Tap density was measured in accordance with Tapped Density Method I of USP except that a 100 mL cylinder was filled with the sample for the testing. Results are reported below in Table 10.

A study was conducted to evaluate the oxidative stability of atrasentan parent atrasentan mandelate salt and atrasentan hydrochloride salt.

About 1 mg of each solid was placed in a 4 mL glass vial and about 10 mg of urea HOco crystal was placed in another 4 mL vial. The two vials then were connected by a connector Kontes connector 13 425X13 425 apt NO 747205 1313 and left in an oven at 40 C. for seven days. Blank samples were prepared by placing about 1 mg of each compound in a 4 mL vial and then storing the vial in a freezer at about 20 C. for the same period of time. The oven samples and freezer blanks were analyzed at the same time by HPLC. The HPLC conditions are summarized in Table II A below. The measured data are reported in Table II B below and the normalized data from Table II B are shown in a bar chart in .

The oxidative stability data reported in Table II B were further evaluated by ANOVA analysis. The ANOVA results are reported in Table II C below.

The data show that the mandelate salt had a statistically significantly higher sample recovery proportion than the hydrochloride salt and atrasentan parent and therefore had greater oxidative stability than the atrasentan parent and hydrochloride salt.

A study was conducted to evaluate the intrinsic dissolution rate as a function of pH for two different crystal forms having prismatic morphology atrasentan parent and atrasentan mandelate salt .

About 100 mg of the sample tested was prepared by compressing the sample in a stainless steel die under 1100 pounds force with a dwell time of one minute to form a pellet. The die diameter 0.373 inch area 0.704 cm containing the pellet was submerged in 250 mL of a phosphate buffer dissolution test medium having a pH of 2.0 5.0 or 7.4. The medium was stirred by a paddle at 50 rpm and maintained at 37 C. To measure the concentration of the sample material in the medium a fiber optic dip probe Diss Profile pION Inc was used to monitor the UV absorbance as a function of time. The measured data are reported in Table 12 A below and are shown graphically in .
