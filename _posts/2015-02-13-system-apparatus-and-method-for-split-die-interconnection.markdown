This disclosure relates generally to semiconductor packages and more specifically but not exclusively to split die semiconductor packages.

Semiconductor packages come in many varieties based on the intended application. A split die semiconductor package is a casing containing two semiconductor dies that provides protection against impact and holds the contact pins or leads that are used to connect from external circuits to the package. The split die architecture requires Die to Die D2D interconnects with very fine line and spaces L S typically 1 1 2 2 . These fine line and spacing parameters are expensive to achieve and create problems with the requirement for exact placement of the die to align with the fine L S routing. Conventional split die semiconductor packages either require a silicon interposer that acts like a bridge or embedded wafer level package eWLP with multiple redistribution layers RDLs that have fine line and space parameters. However conventional interposers increase the height of the package which is undesirable and embedded multiple RDLs are complicated and expensive to manufacture plus they are not suitable for high volume manufacturing.

Accordingly there are long felt industry needs for methods that improve upon conventional methods including the improved methods and apparatus provided hereby.

The inventive features that are characteristic of the teachings together with further features and advantages are better understood from the detailed description and the accompanying figures. Each of the figures is provided for the purpose of illustration and description only and does not limit the present teachings.

The following presents a simplified summary relating to one or more aspects and or examples associated with the apparatus and methods disclosed herein. As such the following summary should not be considered an extensive overview relating to all contemplated aspects and or examples nor should the following summary be regarded to identify key or critical elements relating to all contemplated aspects and or examples or to delineate the scope associated with any particular aspect and or example. Accordingly the following summary has the sole purpose to present certain concepts relating to one or more aspects and or examples relating to the apparatus and methods disclosed herein in a simplified form to precede the detailed description presented below.

Some examples of the disclosure are directed to systems apparatus and methods for a side by side semiconductor package including a first die having an active side and a backside a second die having an active side and a backside the second die being horizontally adjacent the first die and spaced therefrom a bridge interposer having an active side and a backside the bridge interposer active side facing the active sides of the first die and the second die and partially horizontally overlapping the first die and the second die the bridge interposer providing an interconnection between the first die and the second die a first substrate having a cavity therein and attached to the backside of the bridge interposer such that the bridge interposer is positioned within the first substrate cavity and a thermal element attached to the backside of the first die and the backside of the second die the thermal element providing a heat path and heat storage for the first die and the second die.

Other features and advantages associated with the apparatus and methods disclosed herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art based on the accompanying drawings and detailed description.

In accordance with common practice the features depicted by the drawings may not be drawn to scale. Accordingly the dimensions of the depicted features may be arbitrarily expanded or reduced for clarity. In accordance with common practice some of the drawings are simplified for clarity. Thus the drawings may not depict all components of a particular apparatus or method. Further like reference numerals denote like features throughout the specification and figures.

Methods apparatus and systems for interconnection of a split die semiconductor package are provided. In some examples the split die semiconductor package includes a bridge interposer that has fine L S of 2 2 or finer and is positioned within a substrate cavity and a thermal element attached to the backsides of the die in the package. In some examples for PoP packages the split die are also positioned within a substrate cavity of a second substrate. By placing the bridge interposer in a cavity of a package substrate and if applicable placing the die in another package substrate cavity the overall height dimension of the package is reduced. The addition of a thermal element embedded in the second substrate provides a heat dissipation function without increasing the height. In addition the connection of a fine L S bridge interposer to the split die before the die are attached to a substrate using a self aligning solder reflow process avoids the placement problems associated with connecting die with fine L S to the bridge interposer after the die have been attached to a substrate.

Various aspects are disclosed in the following description and related drawings to show specific examples relating to the disclosure. Alternate examples will be apparent to those skilled in the pertinent art upon reading this disclosure and may be constructed and practiced without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. Additionally well known elements will not be described in detail or may be omitted so as to not obscure the relevant details of the aspects and examples disclosed herein.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any details described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other examples. Likewise the term examples does not require that all examples include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation. Use of the terms in one example an example in one feature and or a feature in this specification does not necessarily refer to the same feature and or example. Furthermore a particular feature and or structure can be combined with one or more other features and or structures. Moreover at least a portion of the apparatus described hereby can be configured to perform at least a portion of a method described hereby.

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting of examples of the disclosure. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features integers steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features integers steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

It should be noted that the terms connected coupled or any variant thereof mean any connection or coupling either direct or indirect between elements and can encompass a presence of an intermediate element between two elements that are connected or coupled together via the intermediate element. Coupling and or connection between the elements can be physical logical or a combination thereof. As employed herein elements can be connected or coupled together for example by using one or more wires cables and or printed electrical connections as well as by using electromagnetic energy. The electromagnetic energy can have wavelengths in the radio frequency region the microwave region and or the optical both visible and invisible region. These are several non limiting and non exhaustive examples.

It should be understood that the term signal can include any signal such as a data signal audio signal video signal multimedia signal analog signal and or digital signal. Information and signals can be represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example data an instruction a process step a command information a signal a bit and or a symbol described in this description can be represented by a voltage a current an electromagnetic wave a magnetic field and or particle an optical field and or particle and any combination thereof.

Any reference herein to an element using a designation such as first second and so forth does not limit the quantity and or order of those elements. Rather these designations are used as a convenient method of distinguishing between two or more elements and or instances of an element. Thus a reference to first and second elements does not mean that only two elements can be employed or that the first element must necessarily precede the second element. Also unless stated otherwise a set of elements can comprise one or more elements. In addition terminology of the form at least one of A B or C used in the description or the claims can be interpreted as A or B or C or any combination of these elements. 

Further many examples are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the disclosure may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the examples described herein the corresponding form of any such examples may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

Processor which executes instructions from at least two instruction sets in different instruction set operating modes additionally includes a debug circuit operative to compare upon the execution of each instruction at least a predetermined target instruction set operating mode to the current instruction set operating mode and to provide an indication of a match between the two. Debug circuit is described in greater detail below.

Pipeline fetches instructions from an instruction cache I cache with memory address translation and permissions managed by an Instruction side Translation Lookaside Buffer ITLB . Data is accessed from a data cache D cache with memory address translation and permissions managed by a main Translation Lookaside Buffer TLB . In various examples ITLB may comprise a copy of part of TLB . Alternatively ITLB and TLB may be integrated. Similarly in various examples of processor I cache and D cache may be integrated or unified. Further I cache and D cache may be L1 caches. Misses in I cache and or D cache cause an access to main off chip memory by a memory interface . Memory interface may be a master input to a bus interconnect implementing a shared bus to one or more memory devices that may incorporate the improved data decompression in accordance with some examples of the disclosure. Additional master devices not shown may additionally connect to bus interconnect .

Processor may include input output I O interface which may be a master device on a peripheral bus across which I O interface may access various peripheral devices via bus . Those of skill in the art will recognize that numerous variations of processor are possible. For example processor may include a second level L2 cache for either or both I and D caches . In addition one or more of the functional blocks depicted in processor may be omitted from a particular example. Other functional blocks that may reside in processor such as a JTAG controller instruction pre decoder branch target address cache and the like are not germane to a description of the present disclosure and are omitted for clarity.

Referring to a system that includes a UE here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone which has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from a radio access network RAN that may ultimately come from a core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. Platform can include transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in memory of the wireless device. Memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. Platform also can include local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . Local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. Internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an example of the disclosure can include a UE including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of UE in are to be considered merely illustrative and the disclosure is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between UE and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as code division multiple access CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM Global System for Mobile Communications GSM 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the examples of the disclosure and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of examples of the disclosure.

The bridge interposer may be positioned in the first substrate cavity with the bridge interposer active side facing the first die active side and the second die active side and the bridge interposer backside facing the first substrate .

The bridge interposer active side the first die active side and the second die active side may include bumps that provide external connections between the die or interposer and external elements.

As shown in the process continues with the attachment of a bridge interposer adhesive layer on the backside of the bridge interposer . The adhesive layer may be of different materials that allow the bridge interposer to be securely attached to another component such as a substrate. As shown in the process continues with the addition of a first substrate having a cavity centrally located in the horizontal direction a glass fiber extending horizontally thorough the substrate and a plurality of external connection points or electrically conductive bumps for connecting to pathways and devices external to the first substrate .

As shown in the first substrate is attached to the bridge interposer through the adhesive layer such that the bridge interposer is positioned within cavity to the first die and the second die by attaching the bumps to bumps and bumps . This can be accomplished by a solder reflow process that self aligns the fine bumps with the bumps and to avoid the placement accuracy issues normally associated with pick and placing such fine L S components. As shown in the process continues with the removal of the carrier and re orientation of the remaining package although the re orientation is optional.

As shown in Fig. SI the process continues with application of a thermal interface material to the backsides and of the die. The thermal interface material acts as an adhesive as well as a thermal conductor to transfer heat away from the first die and the second die . As shown in the process continues with the addition of a second substrate having a cavity and a thermal element or layer embedded in the second substrate or at or near the bottom surface of the cavity . The thermal element provides a heat pathway storage and dissipation mechanism for the package and may be composed of material suitable for this purpose. As shown in the partial process concludes with the attached of the second substrate to the first substrate . The thermal element is attached to the thermal interface material on the backsides and of the die so that the die and are centrally located within the cavity . The first substrate is connected to the second substrate through solder balls on the outside edges of the first substrate and second substrate that provides a spacing for the substrates and electrical pathways through associated vias connection points and solder balls. In addition the empty spaces may be filled with an encapsulation or fill material if desired not shown . The double cavity structure will reduce the package height versus conventional approaches for PoP semiconductor packages.

As shown in the carrier is then separated from the composite structure forming separate substrates and . We will describe further processing of the substrate with respect to only one substrate but it should be understood that the further process can be applied to both substrates. As shown in after separating the carrier from substrate connection points are formed in substrate and substrate is coated with a combination litho cu plating layer . The plating layer can be composed of lithographic resin and copper plating. As shown in the plating layer is then stripped to expose various portions of substrate . The portions exposed can be arranged as needed to achieve a desired pattern. As shown in substrate with exposed copper layer is further etched to remove seed layer but keep copper portions and copper plating . As shown in and J following this etching process a mask layer is formed on substrate except in the location of the future cavity or copper plating . Another etching process is applied to substrate to form a cavity . In this etching process the masked portions of substrate are protected from etching and only the exposed copper plating is etched away. As shown in after forming cavity the copper plating is stripped away from substrate . As shown in the mask layer is stripped away. Next a three stage process is applied to substrate . In the three stage process a SR coating is applied exposed and then developed. After this three stage process the substrate structure may be ready for further processing such as surface finishing.
