title: Updating and displaying information in different power modes
abstract: A computing device is described that executes a centralized service and a plurality of applications. The centralized service detects a change from a first power mode of the computing device to a second power mode of the computing device and responsive to detecting the change, determines a first application from the plurality of applications executing at the computing device, to notify of the change from the first power mode to a second power mode. The centralized service outputs to the first application an indication of the change from the first power mode to the second power mode, and responsive to receiving an indication response from the first application, suspends an application processor of the computing device.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62 148 909 filed Apr. 17 2015 the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Some mobile computing devices are referred to as always on devices that continuously update and display information even during seemingly long periods of non use. For instance a watch device is an example of an always on device that may display a watch face graphical user interface and other information even if the watch does not detect user provided input for hours at a time. To conserve energy an always on device may switch between different power modes to provide a user experience with visual complexity during periods of use and reduced energy consumption during periods of non use.

To ensure that applications are providing content that is suited for a particular power mode some always on devices require applications to be tightly coupled to and directly communicable with the underlying hardware being used to present the content. Some always on devices may even inhibit execution of certain applications during some power modes to ensure that the requirements of each power mode are met and the device maintains its appearance of always being on.

In general techniques of this disclosure may enable an application executing at a computing device to dynamically change graphical information being displayed across different power modes of the computing device in compliance with the operating policies that the computing device maintains for each power mode. For example an always on computing device such as a wearable computing device may operate in multiple power modes. The computing device may operate in a full power mode also referred to herein as an active mode when the device infers that a user is more likely interacting with information being presented at a screen. In contrast the computing device may operate in a low power mode also referred to herein as an ambient mode when the device determines that the user is more likely to be only periodically glancing at the information presented at the screen. In the active mode because the user is more likely to be engaged in activity with the computing device the computing device may require an application to follow a set of application operating policies for presenting richer oftentimes more complex content than the computing device otherwise requires the application to present while operating in ambient mode e.g. when the user typically just glances at the information presented at the screen .

Rather than require the application to figure out when the computing device transitions from active to ambient mode or vice versa and to assist an application in updating graphical information in a way that complies with the requirements the computing device has in place for the various power modes the application may register e.g. at start up or at run time with a centralized service executing in the background of the computing device. When the application registers with the centralized service the centralized service lets the application know when a change in power mode has occurred. The centralized service signals the application when the computing device changes operating modes provides the application with an opportunity to change the information being displayed before causing the computing device to go dormant e.g. suspending application processors and or display controllers to conserve battery power and also coordinates whether the application has permission to change the information at the display.

For example while the computing device operates in an active power mode the centralized service may enable an application to cause an application processor of the computing device to output first graphical information for display including a full color rendering of graphical and or interactive content. At a later time the application may receive an indication i.e. data a signal etc. from the centralized service indicating transition out of the active mode and into the ambient mode. While the computing device operates in the ambient mode the application need not directly communicate with any low level or underlying hardware to present graphical information in a format that is compatible with display properties of the second power mode. Instead the application merely needs to recognize that the display controller of the computing device is in charge of re drawing information at the display in a format that is compatible with the ambient mode.

In ambient mode the application may momentarily have access to the application processor so as to output second graphical information e.g. restricted graphical information such as monochromatic or less than full color static content for display via the display controller. After outputting second graphical information for display via the display controller the application may then inform the service that the application is finished using the application processor in response to the transition and yield control of the application processor and the display controller back to the centralized service. In some examples the service may supplement the updated graphical information by configuring the computing device to vibrate play a sound or provide some other indication to the user that the information at the display has been updated.

Computing device may include presence sensitive display . Presence sensitive display of computing device may function as an input component for computing device and as an output component. Presence sensitive display may be implemented using various technologies. For instance presence sensitive display may function as a presence sensitive input component using a presence sensitive screen such as a resistive touchscreen a surface acoustic wave touchscreen a capacitive touchscreen a projective capacitance touchscreen a pressure sensitive screen an acoustic pulse recognition touchscreen a camera and display system or another presence sensitive screen technology. Presence sensitive display may function as an output component such as a display device using any one or more of a liquid crystal display LCD dot matrix display light emitting diode LED display organic light emitting diode OLED display e ink or similar monochrome or color display capable of outputting visible information to the user of computing device .

Presence sensitive display of computing device may include a presence sensitive screen that can receive tactile user input from a user of computing device and present output. Presence sensitive display may receive indications of the tactile user input by detecting one or more tap and or non tap gestures from a user of computing device e.g. the user touching or pointing at one or more locations of presence sensitive display with a finger or a stylus pen and in response to the input computing device may cause presence sensitive display to present output. Presence sensitive display may present the output as part of a user interface e.g. user interface screen shot A or user interface screen shot B which may be related to functionality provided by computing device .

Computing device may include one or more application modules A N collectively referred to as application modules and centralized service module . Modules and may perform operations using software hardware firmware or a mixture of hardware software and or firmware residing in and executing on computing device . Computing device may execute modules and with multiple processors. Computing device may execute modules and as a virtual machine executing on underlying hardware. In some examples presence sensitive display and modules and may be arranged remotely to and remotely accessible from computing device for instance as one or more network services via a network cloud.

Application modules represent any application or activity that is executable at computing device during multiple power modes. In some examples application modules may be built in or system level applications executing at computing device . In some examples application modules are third party applications e.g. applications developed by third party developers and typically downloaded from an application repository accessible from a remote computing system and or the Internet . Examples of application modules may include a watch stopwatch timer application an electronic message application an Internet browser application a fitness application a navigation application a map application or any other type of application that can execute at an always on device such as computing device during an active and ambient mode. Presence sensitive display may present various user interfaces of application modules and a user of computing device may interact with applications to perform a function with computing device through the respective user interface of each application. For the sake of brevity application module A is used to describe the functions described herein although other application modules may support similar functions as application module A.

Each of application modules may cause computing device to present information at presence sensitive display and interpret inputs detected at presence sensitive display or other input components in response to the presentation. For example application module A may be a fitness tracker application that measures distance traveled heart rate calories burned and other fitness information associated with a user of computing device . Application module A may display data e.g. HTML based display data etc. and provide instructions to presence sensitive display that cause presence sensitive display to display a rendered image of the display data as one of interface screen shots A or B. Application module A may cause presence sensitive display to output user interface screen shot A user interface screen shot B or another example user interface for display and as a user interacts with user interface presented at presence sensitive display application module A may interpret inputs detected at presence sensitive display e.g. as a user provides one or more gestures at a location on a surface of presence sensitive display at which user interface screen shot A user interface screen shot B or another example user interface is displayed . Application module A may relay information about the inputs detected at presence sensitive display to one or more associated applications operating systems services and or computing platforms executing at computing device associated with the user interface to cause computing device to perform a function.

User interface screen shots A and B are two examples of a fitness tracker application s graphical user interface. User interface screen shots A and B each include graphical information or graphical indications e.g. graphical elements characters of text etc. of content displayed at various locations of presence sensitive display . In the example of although both user interface screen shots A and B include graphical information about a fitness session of a user user interface screen shot A includes a greater amount of content and more complex presentation characteristics applied to the content than the content included in user interface screen shot B. User interface screen shot A represents graphical information or graphical content for display while computing device operates in a full power or active mode whereas user interface screen shot B represents graphical information or graphical content for display while computing device operates in a low power of ambient mode. When presenting a rendering of user interface screen shot A at presence sensitive display application module A may cause presence sensitive display to present user interface screen shot A with greater presentation characteristics e.g. increased font size smoothness increased resolution full color support greater brightness etc. than the presentation characteristics that presence sensitive display applies to the presentation of user interface screen shot B. For example user interface screen shot A includes text and user interaction buttons on a fading color background while user interface screen shot B may be a monochrome or limited color display with or without visually specified user interaction buttons . In some examples user interface screen shot B may still have a user input feature as will be described later. User interface screen shot A thus includes richer and more complex content than the content of user interface screen shot B.

Given the complexities of user interface screen shot A as compared to user interface screen shot B presence sensitive display may require an application processor of computing device to work in lock step with a display controller of computing device to continuously update and draw the display of presence sensitive display when presence sensitive display displays user interface screen shot A. Conversely being that user interface screen shot B is duller and less complex as compared to user interface screen shot A presence sensitive display may enable an application processor and display controller to work separately to display user interface screen shot B. Presence sensitive display may require the application processor to only periodically update the display of presence sensitive display e.g. as displayed information changes and therefore enable the display controller of computing device to re draw presence sensitive display only as necessary for maintaining user interface screen shot B at presence sensitive display . By only periodically updating the display with the application processor and requiring the display controller to drive presence sensitive display as is necessary for re draw computing device may consume far less electrical power displaying user interface screen shot B as compared to the electrical power required to display user interface screen shot A by using the application processor and display controller together to continuously update and draw the display. As such when computing device operates in an ambient mode to support always on functionality computing device may output a user interface such as user interface screen shot B as opposed to user interface screen shot A. User interface screen shot B is generated based on user interface screen shot A by culling information from interface screen shot A that is compatible for display in ambient mode and formatting it for presentation in ambient mode. For instance application module A may obtain distance and time information included in interface screen shot A and format the information into a limited color or animation free form for presentation as interface screen shot B.

Centralized service module assists application modules in complying with operating policies for updating graphical information across the various power modes of computing device . In particular centralized service module may enable third party applications such as at least some of application modules to comply with the requirements computing device maintains for executing in ambient or low power mode. Instead of having to be tightly coupled to the hardware of computing device or be aware of all the details associated with executing in ambient or low power mode centralized service may enable third party applications to have an abstracted view of ambient or low power mode to easily comply with the low power operating state requirements of computing device . An application module can register with centralized service module and rely on centralized service module to signal the application module when the power mode changes and or enters a power saving mode.

As used herein a service represents a module or application component configured to perform long running operations in the background and does not provide a user interface. Other application components such as application modules can start a service and the service will continue to run in the background even if the user causes the computing device to switch focus to another application. Additionally an application component can bind to a service to interact with the service and even perform inter process communications IPC . For example a service might handle network transactions play music perform file I O or interact with a content provider all while running in the background.

Centralized service module may enable application modules to register e.g. at start up or at run time with centralized service module as centralized service module executes in the background of computing device . When application modules register with centralized service module centralized service module may signal to application modules when computing device changes operating modes. In addition centralized service module may also coordinate whether any of application modules has permission to update graphical information presented at presence sensitive display . In some examples centralized service module may assist other services executing at computing device to determine whether to force computing device into or out of an ambient mode.

Computing device may operate in multiple power modes. For example computing device may operate in active mode in which computing device causes presence sensitive display to display an application user interface or notification in full screen e.g. utilizing many pixels having an increased screen brightness and with the application processor running. Active mode generally draws a lot of power due in part to the fact that the application processor and display controller of computing device continuously work together to update and draw information presented at presence sensitive display . Conversely computing device may operate in ambient mode in which computing device causes presence sensitive display to display a monochrome or limited color watch face with a textual time and date notification peeking from one side e.g. the bottom of the screen and where the screen brightness is low. During the ambient mode the computing device keeps the application processor asleep and not running as much as possible and preferably the vast majority of the time. Accordingly compared to active mode ambient mode draws very little power due in part to the fact that the application processor may only wake in order to update the information before the information is drawn by the display controller at presence sensitive display . Although two power modes are described this disclosure can be extended to three or more power modes each with its own rules regarding display component power usage application processor power usage and other parameters.

In some examples in active mode the display controller may function similar to display controllers of other devices by continuously drawing presence sensitive display based on information in a memory e.g. which is capable of storing one screen image of information of the display controller that is continuously being updated by the application processor. In ambient mode however the display controller may function differently than typical display controllers. The display controller may determine when the application processor is suspended because before the application processor is suspended the application processor via application modules may communicate to the display controller that the display controller is to periodically re draw the last screen image provided in the memory i.e. the last screen image loaded into the local frame buffer memory on the display controller until the application processor re wakes and communicates to the display controller that the display controller is to draw a different image that has subsequently been loaded into the memory.

In accordance with techniques of this disclosure computing device may refrain from outputting watch information at presence sensitive display while operating in ambient mode. Instead an application such as application module may control the entire screen of presence sensitive display while the computing device is in the low power ambient mode.

While computing device operates in a first power mode application module A may cause presence sensitive display to output for display first graphical information. For example application module A may configure presence sensitive display to output user interface screen shot A as part of a fitness application during the active mode of computing device .

Application module A may register with centralized service module . Whenever computing device transitions to active mode centralized service module may notify each of the application modules that are registered with centralized service module of the change in power mode of computing device . Application module A may receive from centralized service module an indication of a change from the first power mode to a second power mode of the computing device. For example application module A may receive data via an IPC protocol indicating that computing device has transitioned from active mode to ambient mode.

While computing device operates in the second power mode application module A may generate based on the first graphical information second graphical information that is compatible with display properties of the second power mode. For example in response to receiving the indication of the change in power mode of computing device application module A may update the graphical information presented by presence sensitive display to comply with the operating requirements of the ambient mode.

For instance while in an ambient mode application module A may want to update presence sensitive display periodically e.g. less frequently than an update rate of presence sensitive display or even sporadically in order to show new information to a user e.g. an updated navigation instruction or perhaps how many steps a device has measured during a user s run . Working with centralized service module application module A can process data collected by sensors of computing device while the application processor was asleep and based on the sensor information cause presence sensitive display to update the screen. After finishing updating the information for presentation at presence sensitive display application module A and centralized service module may enable the application processor to go back to sleep during the ambient mode. Said differently while computing device operates in active mode application module A may send graphical information to an application processor of computing device for continuously updating a memory of a display controller of computing device for drawing a presence sensitive display and while computing device operates in ambient mode application module A may send updated graphical information to the application processor for periodically updating the memory of the display controller for drawing presence sensitive display .

In some examples application module A may receive from centralized service module display policies e.g. a quantity of colors supported by the second mode a transition animation supported by the second mode etc. associated with the second mode. Application module A may generate the second graphical information based on the display policies received from centralized service module .

After generating user interface screen shot B as an ambient mode compliant version of user interface screen shot A application module A may output for display the second graphical information. For example application module A may call on centralized service module to update presence sensitive display by sending the second graphical information to centralized service module and having the centralized service module instruct the display controller of presence sensitive display to draw the screen. In some examples application module A may control the display controller of presence sensitive display directly to cause presence sensitive display to draw user interface screen shot A as user interface screen shot B and then the application module A goes to sleep in conformance with ambient mode operating policies. Periodically application module A may be woken up by centralized service module to update and draw graphical user interface screen shot B e.g. to increment the distance traveled and or other information based on sensor data collected by computing device .

In some examples computing device may enter ambient mode based at least in part on whether computing device is currently charging. Application modules executing at computing device need not be aware of how or why computing device enters or does not enter ambient mode. Instead application module A can simply rely on a signal from centralized service module that indicates whether computing device has changed power modes to determine whether to alter the graphical information presented at presence sensitive display . In this way application modules can comply with operating policies of ambient mode without being tightly coupled to hardware or details of how and why computing device enters and exits the different modes.

Because some computing devices such as computing device may have many application modules that can provide ambient mode and active mode graphical information some of application modules may support ambient mode and some may not. In some examples if one of application modules does not support an ambient mode centralized service module may configure presence sensitive display to display a default user interface e.g. watch face or time and date information .

Computing device does not require application modules to be tightly coupled to and directly communicable with the underlying hardware being used to present graphical content in order to comply with the operating policies of the various power modes. Additionally computing device need not inhibit execution of certain applications during some power modes as a way to ensure that the operating requirements of each power mode are met and the device maintains its appearance of always being on. Instead computing device relies on centralized service module and the capability centralized service module provides to application modules to enable application modules e.g. third party developers of applications for computing device that are not built in to the operating platform or operating system and can be downloaded from an application repository and installed to execute in an application layer of computing device to determine when computing device is in an interactive ambient and off mode e.g. a mode in which presence sensitive display refrains from presenting information to comply with the operating policies of device .

As shown in the example of computing device includes presence sensitive display one or more processors one or more input components one or more communication units one or more output components and one or more storage components . Processors include one or more application processors and presence sensitive display includes display component presence sensitive input component and one or more display controllers . One or more storage components of computing device also include application modules and centralized service module . Additionally storage components include other service modules A N and libraries A N.

Communication channels may interconnect each of the components and for inter component communications physically communicatively and or operatively . In some examples communication channels may include a system bus a network connection an inter process communication data structure or any other method for communicating data.

One or more input components of computing device may receive input. Examples of input are tactile audio and video input. Input components of computing device in one example includes a presence sensitive display touch sensitive screen mouse keyboard voice responsive system video camera microphone or any other type of device for detecting input from a human or machine.

One or more output components of computing device may generate output. Examples of output are tactile audio and video output. Output components of computing device in one example includes a presence sensitive display sound card video graphics adapter card speaker cathode ray tube CRT monitor liquid crystal display LCD or any other type of device for generating output to a human or machine.

One or more communication units of computing device may communicate with external devices via one or more wired and or wireless networks by transmitting and or receiving network signals on the one or more networks. Examples of communication unit include a network interface card e.g. such as an Ethernet card an optical transceiver a radio frequency transceiver a GPS receiver or any other type of device that can send and or receive information. Other examples of communication units may include short wave radios cellular data radios wireless network radios as well as universal serial bus USB controllers.

Presence sensitive display of computing device includes display component and presence sensitive input component . Display component may be a screen at which information is displayed by presence sensitive display and presence sensitive input component may detect an object at and or near display component . As one example range presence sensitive input component may detect an object such as a finger or stylus that is within two inches or less of display component . Presence sensitive input component may determine a location e.g. an x y coordinate of display component at which the object was detected. In another example range presence sensitive input component may detect an object six inches or less from display component and other ranges are also possible. Presence sensitive input component may determine the location of display component selected by a user s finger using capacitive inductive and or optical recognition techniques. In some examples presence sensitive input component also provides output to a user using tactile audio or video stimuli as described with respect to display component . In the example of presence sensitive display presents a user interface such as user interface screen shots A and B of .

While illustrated as an internal component of computing device presence sensitive display may also represent and external component that shares a data path with computing device for transmitting and or receiving input and output. For instance in one example presence sensitive display represents a built in component of computing device located within and physically connected to the external packaging of computing device e.g. a screen on a mobile phone . In another example presence sensitive display represents an external component of computing device located outside and physically separated from the packaging of computing device e.g. a monitor a projector etc. that shares a wired and or wireless data path with a tablet computer .

Presence sensitive display is configured to present full color graphical content while computing device operates in active mode. Presence sensitive display is further configured to present less than full color content while computing device operates in ambient mode.

Presence sensitive display may further include one or more display controllers that may be responsible for managing the execution of the underlying hardware and embedded software and or drivers associated with presence sensitive display . Said another way display controllers may implement functionality and or execute instructions within computing device that specifically geared to the form fit and functionality of presence sensitive display . In some examples display controllers are separate components of computing device that are operably coupled to presence sensitive display . In ambient mode application modules may call on display controllers to draw or re draw graphical content presented at presence sensitive display . In this way application processors can remain dormant as much as possible while continuing to provide updated information at presence sensitive display .

In some examples display controllers are specialized processors that consume much less electrical power in operation as compared to processors . In some examples modules may call on display controller to draw and or re draw graphical content for display at presence sensitive display rather than continuously call on processors to first update the graphical content as a way to save power. For example application module A may receive information indicating that computing device is operating in an ambient power mode or low power mode. Application module A may initially output graphical content to application processors for display at presence sensitive display . However rather than continuously call on application processors to drive display when the graphical content is not changing application module A may instruct display controller to simply re draw the graphical content being displayed at presence sensitive display . In this way application module A uses less power to maintain a user interface at a display than would otherwise be consumed if application processor were used continuously to update and draw presence sensitive display .

One or more processors may implement functionality and or execute instructions within computing device . For example processors on computing device may receive and execute instructions stored by storage components that execute the functionality of modules . These instructions executed by processors may cause computing device to store information within storage components during program execution. Processors may execute instructions of modules to cause presence sensitive display to render portions of content of display data as one of user interface screen shots A and B at presence sensitive display . That is modules may be operable by processors to perform various actions or functions of computing device for instance causing presence sensitive display to present user interface screen shots A and B at presence sensitive display .

Application processors generally represent any computation intensive and power hungry processor configured primarily for executing application modules . That is when it comes to causing presence sensitive display to present rich complex content associated with application modules and or to execute the functionality of application modules application processors provide sufficient computation power to execute the functions of applications to meet the requirements of computing device . Computing device generally relies on application processors to execute application modules . In addition application processors are used by computing device to drive or otherwise control presence sensitive display during full power or active mode. In active mode application modules may call on application processors to continuously update the graphical content presented at presence sensitive display . In this way the additional power drawn by application processors for controlling presence sensitive display is offset in active mode by the richer more complex e.g. often animated content displayed at presence sensitive display as compared to ambient mode.

One or more storage components within computing device may store information for processing during operation of computing device e.g. computing device may store data accessed by modules during execution at computing device . In some examples storage component is a temporary memory meaning that a primary purpose of storage component is not long term storage. Storage components on computing device may configured for short term storage of information as volatile memory and therefore not retain stored contents if powered off. Examples of volatile memories include random access memories RAM dynamic random access memories DRAM static random access memories SRAM and other forms of volatile memories known in the art.

Storage components in some examples also include one or more computer readable storage media. Storage components may be configured to store larger amounts of information than volatile memory. Storage components may further be configured for long term storage of information as non volatile memory space and retain information after power on off cycles. Examples of non volatile memories include magnetic hard discs optical discs floppy discs flash memories or forms of electrically programmable memories EPROM or electrically erasable and programmable EEPROM memories. Storage components may store program instructions and or information e.g. data associated with modules and and display data and presentation properties .

Libraries A N collectively libraries are repositories of source code and or resources relied upon by application modules to perform functions. For example application module A may access one of libraries while calling upon presence sensitive display and or centralized service as application module A provides graphical content for display using application processors or display controller . Application module A may utilize an application programming interface API to call one or more functions for performing operations described herein. In some examples libraries include code and or resources for enabling computing device to enable an application to dynamically adapt graphical information for presentation in different power modes without having to manage the complex display and power consumption policies that may be associated with each power mode. Said differently libraries may include the source code and functions that are accessible by modules to perform the techniques described herein for configuring presence sensitive display to display graphical information that is suited to the current power mode of computing device .

Centralized service module may be operable by application processors to detect a change from a first power mode of computing device to a second power mode of computing device e.g. a change from active mode to ambient mode or vice versa . Responsive to detecting the change centralized service module may be operable by application processors to output to one or more of application modules an indication of the change from the first power mode to a second power mode. For instance centralized service module may share data with application modules indicating the change. Responsive to receiving an indication that the one or more application modules are finished outputting graphical information using application processors and or display controller in response to the change from the first power mode to the second power mode centralized service module may be operable by application processors to suspend the control by the one or more application modules control display controller . In other words after receiving an indication from the one or more application modules of completion of updating and drawing the information presented at presence sensitive display centralized service module may disable application processors to save power by rendering control by one or more application modules over to display controller .

Application module A may be operable by application processors to responsive to receiving the indication of the change from centralized service module momentarily wake application processors to update the graphical information being drawn by display controller at presence sensitive display while computing device operates in the second power mode. For example application module A may configure presence sensitive display to present user interface screen shot B instead of user interface screen shot A after receiving the indication of the change. Application module A may be operable by application processors to output the indication that application module A is finished outputting the graphical information using application processors and display controller e.g. to relinquish control of display controller back to centralized service module and or other application modules .

In some examples application module A is further operable by application processors to output to application processors first graphical information for display at presence sensitive display while the computing device operates in the first power mode and generate based on the first graphical information the second graphical information that is compatible with display properties of the display while the computing device operates in the second power mode. In other words to provide continuity between power modes application module A may generate user interface screen shot B for display in ambient mode based on the information contained in user interface screen shot A which is being displayed before the transition to ambient mode.

In operation application module A may output for display first graphical information while computing device operates in a first power mode . For example application module A may configure application processor to continuously update and cause display controllers to draw presence sensitive display to present a user interface such as user interface screen shot A.

In some examples the first graphical information may be output for display by application module A in a foreground of a first graphical user interface of computing device while computing device operates in the first power mode. In other words application module A may cause presence sensitive display to output graphical user interface screen shot A in front and or centered at a screen of presence sensitive display when computing device operates in active mode just prior to computing device s transition to ambient mode.

Application module A may receive an indication from centralized service module of a change from the first power mode to a second power mode of computing device . For example in response to receiving data from centralized service module of the transition by computing device from an active mode to an ambient mode application module A may begin updating the information presence sensitive display presents to comply with the operating requirements of the ambient mode.

That is while computing device operates in the second power mode application module A may generate based on the first graphical information second graphical information that is compatible with display properties of the second power mode. For instance application module A may briefly utilize application processors to determine updated distance or fitness information related to a user s run. Application module A may generate renderable content that conveys the updated information to a user.

Additionally while computing device operates in the second power mode application module A may output the second graphical information for display . For example application module A may use application processors to update presence sensitive display and call on display controllers to draw the graphical information presented at presence sensitive display to include the updated information e.g. as user interface screen shot B .

In some examples the second graphical information may be output for display in a foreground of a second graphical user interface of the computing device while the computing device operates in the second power mode. In other words application module A may cause presence sensitive display to output graphical user interface screen shot B in front and centered at a screen of presence sensitive display when computing device operates in ambient mode to preserve continuity with the types of information computing device was presenting just prior to computing device s transition to ambient mode.

In some examples application module A may receive the indication of the change from the first power mode to the second power mode after outputting to centralize service module an indication that application module A supports the second mode of computing device . In other words application module A may register with centralized service module pre execution and by registering be notified by centralized service module when computing device changes operating states.

In some examples centralized service module may answer library calls from functions stored at libraries that application module A accesses to utilize the appropriate display driver. For example application module A may call a display function from libraries to configure presence sensitive display to present user interface screen shot B. To application module A the display function takes care of drawing presence sensitive display using the appropriate order of operations associated with application processors or display controller . Behind the scenes centralized service module answers the display function call and causes the correct operations associated with application processors and or display controller to be performed for drawing the graphical content presented at presence sensitive display . In the case of active mode centralized service module uses application processors to continuously update the graphical content presented at presence sensitive display and uses display controller to draw graphical content presented at presence sensitive display . In the case of ambient mode centralized service module only periodically calls on application processors to update the graphical content while utilizing display controller to re draw graphical content presented at presence sensitive display between the periodic calls to application processors .

In some examples application module A may execute at application processors regardless of whether computing device is executing in the first or second power modes. In other words application processors execute instructions for performing operations associated with each of application modules but application modules may configure display controller to depending on the power mode draw with an update or re draw presence sensitive display without an update from application processors .

In some examples after application module A outputs the second graphical information for display application module A may output to centralized service module an indication that application module A is finished executing at the application processor in response to the change from the first power mode to the second power mode. And in some examples after application module A outputs the second graphical information for display application module A may output to centralized service module an indication that application module A is finished calling on display controller in response to the change from the first power mode to the second power mode. Said differently centralized service module may relinquish some control over computing device to application module A while computing device operates in ambient mode. Barring a time out e.g. if application module A holds control for too long centralized service module may refrain from giving control to other components of computing device until centralized service module receives an indication that application module A is finished executing and or updating information displayed at presence sensitive display .

Rather than require the application to figure out when the computing device transitions from active to ambient mode or vice versa and to assist an application in updating graphical information in a way that complies with the requirements the computing device has in place for the various power modes an application may register e.g. at start up or at run time with a centralized service such as centralized service module executing in the background of the computing device. When the application registers with the centralized service the centralized service lets the application know when a change in power mode has occurred. The centralized service signals the application when the computing device changes operating modes provides the application with an opportunity to update information before causing the computing device to go dormant e.g. suspending application processors and or display controllers to conserve battery power and also coordinates whether the application has permission to update the display.

In operation centralized service module may detect a change from a first power mode of computing device to a second power mode of computing device . For example centralized service module and or one or more of modules may manage one or more timers or analyze user inputs to determine when to cause computing device to transition from a full power active mode to a low power ambient mode. For instance centralized service module may determine that a user provided an explicit input at presence sensitive display e.g. palming or otherwise covering up the screen with his or her hand to cause computing device to enter ambient mode. In some examples if centralized service module deems that sufficient time has elapsed without user input that computing device is to enter ambient mode.

In any case centralized service module may detect a change from active mode to ambient mode and response to the change centralized service module may determine a first application from a plurality of applications executing at the computing device to notify of the change from the first power mode to a second power mode . In other words centralized service module may determine an initial application from application modules to notify of the change from active mode to ambient mode.

In some examples centralized service module may determine the first application to notify of the change in response to receiving an indication from the first application that the first application supports the second mode of the computing device. For instance as application module A may have registered with centralized service module centralized service module may be aware that application module A supports displaying information in ambient mode.

In some examples centralized service module may determine the first application to notify of the change in response to determining the first application was outputting graphical information in a foreground of a graphical user interface of the computing device prior to detecting the change. Said differently centralized service module may notify the one of application modules that was presenting graphical content for display in active mode just before the transition to ambient mode or vice versa. In this way to a user computing device may provide a seamless transition between displaying useful and updated information in multiple power modes.

Centralized service module may output to the first application an indication of the change from the first power mode to a second power mode . For example in response to determining application module A is the first application to notify of the change centralized service module may signal to application module A to wake up and handle updating the information presented at presence sensitive display to be compatible with the operating requirements of ambient mode.

In some examples after outputting the indication of the change from the first power mode to the second power mode centralized service module may receive from the first application a request to manipulate a display property of a display of the computing device determine a display permission associated with the first application and responsive to determining the display permission satisfies the request modify based on the request the display property of the display. In other words centralized service module may ensure that computing device can effectively mediate requests made by multiple application modules to update and draw information presented at presence sensitive display . Unlike other systems that reserve updating and drawing a display for use by system components only centralized service module enables application modules to update and re draw presence sensitive display while in ambient mode while ensuring application modules correctly manipulate the display state or brightness.

Centralized service module may receive an indication response that the first application is finished outputting graphical information that is compatible with display properties of the second power mode and in response to the indication . In other words centralized service module may wait to hear back from application module A that application module A is finished updating presence sensitive display in compliance with operating requirements of the ambient mode.

In response to receiving data indication application module A is finished with the update of presence sensitive display centralized service module may suspend control by the first application of application processor and or display controller of computing device . In other words to conserve battery power and minimize power consumption while in ambient mode centralized service module may cause application processors and or display controller to go dormant until a subsequent update and draw or re draw without update of presence sensitive display .

In some examples responsive to receiving the indication that the first application is finished executing in response to the change from the first power mode to the second power mode centralized service module may determine a second application module from the plurality of application modules executing at computing device to notify of the change. In other words centralized service module may repeat operations for a second application registered with centralized service module that needs access to application processors display controllers and or presence sensitive display during ambient mode. In this way centralized service module may handle waking and communicating with multiple application modules that execute in ambient mode and resolve conflicts between them e.g. two application modules simultaneously configuring display controller to update a graphical image displayed at presence sensitive display . For example centralized service module may give a single application module access to application processor and or display controller at a time.

In some examples responsive to receiving an indication that the application is finished executing in response to the change from the first power mode to the second power mode centralized service module may suspend the application s control over application processors of computing device . In other words to conserve battery power and minimize power consumption while in ambient mode centralized service module may cause application modules to go dormant as much as possible while computing device operates in ambient mode. When centralized service module learns that application module A is finished using application processors for updating presence sensitive display and after determining no further application modules need notifying of the change to ambient mode centralized service module may cause application processors to go dormant until a subsequent update of presence sensitive display .

In some examples responsive to determining that a threshold amount of time since application module A output the graphical information centralized service module may update the graphical information e.g. move the information slightly off centered and output to display controller a command to draw the updated graphical information to prevent burn in. For example a drawback of always on devices such as computing device is that some screen technology is susceptible to burn in. Rather than cause application modules to manage burn in prevention centralized service module may periodically cause display controller to slightly shift one or more pixels of presence sensitive display in any direction to prevent burn in during ambient mode.

In accordance with techniques of this disclosure a centralized service executing in the background of a computing device may enable an application module to specify that it supports an ambient mode at runtime or through its manifest. In addition the centralized service may inform the application module when a transition to an ambient or interactive mode is occurring while it is running in the foreground. While in the ambient mode in addition the centralized service may enable the application module to inform the system when it is safe to suspend the application processor. This may be accomplished implicitly simply by returning from an ambient mode callback with the assumption that the application module is responsible for holding a wake lock from that point forward if it needs to prevent the application processor from suspending. In addition the centralized service may while in the ambient mode enable the application module to inform the system when the application module is finished communicating with the display controller. This may be accomplished by some kind of request to draw finished drawing mechanism. In addition the centralized service may ensure that the system can effectively mediate requests made by application modules that support ambient mode. In addition the centralized service may provide information to the application module about the desired UI rendering mode while in an ambient mode e.g. onebit monochrome 3 bit color etc. . In addition the centralized service may enable the application module to animate its content when transitioning into and out of ambient mode. Furthermore the centralized service may support display burn in prevention transparently in the system without API impact or knowledge of ambient application modules.

In accordance with techniques of this disclosure as a user goes out for a run while wearing a computing device such as computing device and looks down at a screen such as presence sensitive display the user may see his or her heart rate distance covered current pace and time running even though computing device may be operating in ambient mode. The centralized service enables the fitness application running in the background to draw the display while in ambient mode. The information drawn by the fitness application is seemingly always visible at a glance and the user need not wake e.g. by touching the device to bring it out of ambient mode and into active mode to see the information that is critical to the activity.

In accordance with techniques of this disclosure as a user interacts with a computing device such as computing device the user may provide input at computing device to obtain navigation directions while walking to a new restaurant. The computing device may output a vibration at every turn and provide a full screen view including information with distance count down street name direction and the like as the user navigates to the restaurant. Even though walking to the restaurant may take thirty minutes or more providing this information in ambient mode according to the described techniques may hardly impacts the battery usage of the device in a noticeable way. In addition the device may enable the user to obtain more information simply by tapping on the screen to turn on color and place the device back into active mode.
