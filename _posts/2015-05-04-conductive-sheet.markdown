This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 511 551 filed May 23 2012 which is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT JP2010 070939 filed Nov. 24 2010 claiming priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009 266754 filed Nov. 24 2009 the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to a conductive sheet a method for using a conductive sheet and a capacitive touch panel and for example to a conductive sheet suitable for use in a projected capacitive touch panel a method for using a conductive sheet and a capacitive touch panel.

Common capacitive touch panels are position input devices capable of detecting a human finger touch position based on an electrostatic capacitance change between the finger and a conductive film. Such capacitive touch panels include surface capacitive touch panels and projected capacitive touch panels. The surface capacitive touch panel has a simple structure but is incapable of simultaneously detecting two or more touch points multi touch detection . On the other hand the projected capacitive touch panel has a structure containing a large number of electrodes arranged in a matrix similar to a pixel structure of a liquid crystal display device etc. More specifically the structure is such that a plurality of electrodes are arranged and connected in series in the vertical direction to form a first electrode array a plurality of the first electrode arrays are arranged in the horizontal direction a plurality of electrodes are arranged and connected in series in the horizontal direction to form a second electrode array a plurality of the second electrode arrays are arranged in the vertical direction and capacitance changes are sequentially detected by the first and second electrode arrays to achieve multi touch detection. Such conventional projected capacitive touch panels include a capacitive input device described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 310551.

However the capacitive input device described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2008 310551 is disadvantageously poor in finger position detection accuracy because it is necessary to form gaps between first and second electrode arrays arranged on one main surface of a substrate to prevent short circuit of the first and second electrode arrays. Furthermore the capacitive input device is disadvantageous in that electrode connections of the second electrode arrays are formed on electrode connections of the first electrode arrays with insulation layers in between to prevent short circuit of intersections cross points of the first and second electrode arrays whereby the intersections have large thicknesses and appear as local black points in the touch panel surface to significantly deteriorate the visibility. In addition mask patterns are required to form the insulation layers and the electrode connections thereon thereby resulting in complicated production process and high production cost.

The problems may be solved by using a structure containing the first electrode arrays formed on one main surface of a transparent substrate and the second electrode arrays formed on the other main surface thereof.

However this structure may cause the following problem in the future. Though the projected capacitive touch panel has currently been used mainly in small devices such as PDAs personal digital assistants and mobile phones the touch panel is expected to be used in large devices such as personal computer displays. This is because a standard operating system OS for a personal computer has recently been made compliant with a multi touch technology.

The electrodes used in the conventional projected capacitive touch panel are composed of ITO indium tin oxide and therefore have high resistance of several hundred ohm sq. Thus if the touch panel is used in the large devices in the above future trend the large sized touch panel exhibits a low current transfer rate between the electrodes and thereby exhibits a low response speed a long time between finger contact and touch position detection .

In view of the above problems an object of the present invention is to provide a conductive sheet and a conductive sheet using method where the conductive sheet can have a low resistance conductive pattern on a substrate can exhibit an improved visibility and can be suitably used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a projected capacitive touch panel that can have a low resistance conductive pattern on a substrate can exhibit an improved visibility and can be suitably used as a large sized projected capacitive touch panel or the like.

Several embodiments of the conductive sheet the conductive sheet using method and the touch panel of the present invention will be described below with reference to . It should be noted that in this description a numeric range of A to B includes both the numeric values A and B as the lower limit and upper limit values.

As shown in a conductive sheet according to a first embodiment hereinafter referred to as first conductive sheet A has two or more conductive first large lattices A composed of a thin metal wire formed on one main surface of a first transparent substrate A see . Each of the first large lattices A comprises a combination of two or more small lattices . The first large lattices A each have the sides that are opposite to each other and the shapes of the sides are alternated. First connections A composed of a thin metal wire are formed between adjacent ones of the first large lattices A and electrically connect these adjacent first large lattices A to each other. The first connections A each contain one or more medium lattices through and the pitch of the medium lattices is n times large than that of the small lattices in which n is a real number larger than 1 . The small lattices have a smallest square shape. For example the thin metal wire contains gold Au silver Ag or copper Cu .

The two or more first large lattices A are arranged in an x direction a first direction with the first connections A disposed therebetween to form a first conductive pattern A composed of the thin metal wire. Two or more of the first conductive patterns A are arranged in a y direction a second direction perpendicular to the x direction. Electrically isolated first insulations A are disposed between the adjacent first conductive patterns A.

More specifically on the four sides of each first large lattice A i.e. a first side and a second side which are adjacent to a corner that is not connected to an adjacent first large lattice A and a third side and a fourth side which are adjacent to another corner that is not connected to an adjacent first large lattice A the two or more rectangular shapes are arranged to form a rectangular wave shape. Particularly in the first large lattice A the rectangular shapes on the first side are alternated with those on the fourth side opposite to the first side and the rectangular shapes on the second side are alternated with those on the third side opposite to the second side . The two or more small lattices are arranged to form the rectangular wave shape of each of the sides of each first large lattice A.

In the first connection A the four medium lattices the first medium lattice to the fourth medium lattice are arranged in a zigzag manner and each of the medium lattices has a size equal to the total size of four small lattices . The first medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the second side and the fourth side and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The second medium lattice is disposed on one side of the first medium lattice the straight line along the second side and forms a square space. Thus the shape of the second medium lattice is such that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The third medium lattice is adjacent to the first medium lattice and the second medium lattice and has the same shape as the second medium lattice . The fourth medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the third side and the first side is adjacent to the second medium lattice and the third medium lattice and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice as well as the first medium lattice . In a case where the small lattices have an arrangement pitch Ps and the medium lattices have an arrangement pitch Pm of 2 Ps.

As described above in the first conductive sheet A the two or more first large lattices A are arranged in the x direction with the first connections A disposed therebetween to form one first conductive pattern A the two or more small lattices are combined to form each first large lattice A. In each first large lattice A the shapes of the sides thereof that are opposite to each other are alternated. As a result the first conductive sheet A can exhibit a significantly lowered electrical resistance as compared with structures using one ITO film for one electrode. Thus if the first conductive sheet A is used in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased.

A pair of touch panel conductive sheets which use the first conductive sheet A described above i.e. a touch panel conductive sheet according to the present embodiment will be described below with reference to .

As shown in the touch panel conductive sheet is obtained by stacking the first conductive sheet A and a second conductive sheet B to be hereinafter described.

The first conductive sheet A has been described above and will not be described repeatedly in detail. As shown in however in one end of each first conductive pattern A the first connection A is not formed on the open end of the first large lattice A. In the other end of the first conductive pattern A the end of the first large lattice A is electrically connected to a first external wiring A.

As shown in the second conductive sheet B has two or more conductive second large lattices B composed of a thin metal wire formed on one main surface of a second transparent substrate B. As shown in each of the second large lattices B comprises a combination of two or more small lattices . The second large lattices B each have the sides that are opposite to each other and the shapes of the sides are alternated. Second connections B composed of a thin metal wire are disposed between adjacent ones of the second large lattices B and electrically connect these adjacent second large lattices B to each other. The second connections B each contain one or more medium lattices and the pitch of the medium lattices is n times large than that of the small lattices in which n is a real number larger than 1 .

The two or more second large lattices B are arranged in the y direction the second direction with the second connections B disposed therebetween to form one second conductive pattern B. Two or more of the second conductive patterns B are arranged in the x direction the first direction perpendicular to the y direction. Electrically isolated second insulations B are disposed between the adjacent second conductive patterns B.

More specifically on the four sides of each second large lattice B i.e. a fifth side and a sixth side which are adjacent to a corner that is not connected to an adjacent second large lattice B and a seventh side and an eighth side which are adjacent to another corner that is not connected to an adjacent second large lattice B the two or more rectangular shapes are arranged to form the rectangular wave shape. Particularly in the second large lattice B the rectangular shapes on the fifth side are alternated with those on the eighth side opposite to the fifth side and the rectangular shapes on the sixth side are alternated with those on the seventh side opposite to the sixth side

In the second connection B the four medium lattices the fifth medium lattice to the eighth medium lattice are arranged in a zigzag manner and each of the medium lattices has a size equal to the total size of four small lattices . The fifth medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the sixth side and the eighth side and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice . The sixth medium lattice is disposed on one side of the fifth medium lattice the second straight line along the sixth side and forms a square space. Thus the shape of the sixth medium lattice is such that four small lattices are arranged in a matrix and the central cross is removed. The seventh medium lattice is adjacent to the fifth medium lattice and the sixth medium lattice and has the same shape as the sixth medium lattice . The eighth medium lattice is disposed at the boundary between the seventh side and the fifth side is adjacent to the sixth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice and forms an L shaped space in combination with one small lattice as the fifth medium lattice . Also in the second conductive sheet B in a case where the small lattices have an arrangement pitch Ps the medium lattices have an arrangement pitch Pm of 2 Ps.

As shown in in one end of each second conductive pattern B the second connection B is not formed on the open end of the second large lattice B. In the other end of the second conductive pattern B the end of the second large lattice B is electrically connected to a second external wiring B.

For example as shown in in a case where the first conductive sheet A is stacked on the second conductive sheet B to form the touch panel conductive sheet the first connections A of the first conductive patterns A and the second connections B of the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A see in between. Also the first insulations A between the first conductive patterns A and the second insulations B between the second conductive patterns B are arranged facing each other with the first transparent substrate A in between. Though the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are exaggeratingly shown by thick lines and thin lines respectively to clearly represent the positions thereof in they have the same line width.

In a case where the stacked first conductive sheet A and second conductive sheet B are observed from above the spaces between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A are filled with the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B. In this observation the openings of recesses of the rectangular wave shapes on the first sides and the second sides of the first large lattices A are connected to the distal end portions of protrusions of the rectangular wave shapes on the sixth sides and the eighth sides of the second large lattices B so that the small lattices are arranged over the stack contiguously. Similarly the openings of recesses of the rectangular wave shapes on the third sides and the fourth sides of the first large lattices A are connected to the distal end portions of protrusions of the rectangular wave shapes on the fifth sides and the seventh sides of the second large lattices B so that the small lattices are arranged over the stack contiguously. As a result the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B cannot be easily found. In the rectangular wave shapes the openings of recesses overlap with the distal end portions of protrusions as described above whereby the boundaries between the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B are made less visible to improve the visibility. Though an opening having a cross shape is formed in each overlap of the first insulation A and the second insulation B the opening does not block a light and is less visible unlike the above thickened line.

In a case where the overlaps of the first connections A and the second connections B are observed from above the connection point of the fifth medium lattice and the seventh medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the second medium lattice in the first connection A the connection point of the sixth medium lattice and the eighth medium lattice in the second connection B is positioned approximately at the center of the third medium lattice in the first connection A and the first medium lattices to the eighth medium lattices form a plurality of the small lattices in combination. Therefore the plural small lattices are formed by the combination of the first connections A and the second connections B in the overlaps. Thus formed small lattices cannot be distinguished from the surrounding small lattices in the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B so that the visibility is improved.

In a case where the touch panel conductive sheet is used in a touch panel a protective layer is formed on the first conductive sheet A. Furthermore the first external wiring A extending from a large number of the first conductive patterns A in the first conductive sheet A and the second external wiring B extending from a large number of the second conductive patterns B in the second conductive sheet B are connected to an IC circuit for position calculation or the like.

In a case where a finger comes into contact with the protective layer signals are transmitted from the first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B facing the finger touch position to the IC circuit. The finger touch position is calculated in the IC circuit based on the transmitted signals. Thus even if two fingers come into contact with the protective layer simultaneously each of the finger touch positions can be detected.

As described above in a case where the touch panel conductive sheet is used e.g. in a projected capacitive touch panel or the like the response speed and the size of the touch panel can be easily increased. Furthermore the boundaries between the first large lattices A of the first conductive sheet A and the second large lattices B of the second conductive sheet B are less visible and the first connections A and the second connections B form the plural small lattices in combination so that defects such as local line thickening can be prevented and the overall visibility can be improved.

In the touch panel conductive sheet the four sides the first side to the fourth side of the first large lattice A and the four sides the fifth side to the eighth side of the second large lattice B have the equivalent rectangular wave shapes whereby charge localization in the ends of the first large lattices A and the second large lattices B can be reduced to prevent false finger position detection.

Though the arrangement pitch Pm of the medium lattices in the first connections A and the second connections B is twice larger than the arrangement pitch Ps of the small lattices in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of the above embodiments the pitch Pm may be appropriately selected depending on the number of the medium lattices . For example the pitch Pm may be 1.5 or 3 times larger than the pitch Ps. If the pitch Pm of the medium lattices is excessively small or large it may be difficult to arrange the large lattices resulting in poor appearance. Thus the pitch Pm is preferably 1 to 10 times more preferably 1 to 5 times larger than the pitch Ps of the small lattices .

Also the sizes of the small lattices including the side length and the diagonal line length the number of the small lattices in the first large lattice A and the number of the small lattices in the second large lattice B may be appropriately selected depending on the size and the resolution the line number of the touch panel.

As shown in in the above touch panel conductive sheet the first conductive patterns A are formed on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B are formed on the one main surface of the second transparent substrate B. Alternatively as shown in the structure of the touch panel conductive sheet may be such that the first conductive patterns A are formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B are formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. In addition another layer may be formed between the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. The first conductive pattern A and the second conductive pattern B may be arranged facing each other as long as they are insulated.

The first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B may be produced as follows. For example a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A or the second transparent substrate B and thereon a photosensitive silver halide containing emulsion layer may be exposed and developed whereby metallic silver portions and light transmitting portions may be formed in the exposed areas and the unexposed areas respectively to obtain the first conductive patterns A or the second conductive patterns B. The metallic silver portions may be subjected to a physical development treatment and or a plating treatment to deposit a conductive metal thereon.

As shown in the first conductive patterns A may be formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B may be formed on the other main surface thereof. In this case if the one main surface is exposed and then the other main surface is exposed in the usual method the desired first conductive patterns A and second conductive patterns B cannot be obtained occasionally. In particular it is difficult to uniformly form the pattern wherein the rectangular wave shapes project from the sides or the first large lattices A and second large lattices B.

Thus the first conductive patterns A on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A are formed by subjecting the photosensitive silver halide emulsion layers on both sides of the first transparent substrate A to one shot exposure.

First in the step S of a long photosensitive material is prepared. As shown in the photosensitive material has the first transparent substrate A a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer hereinafter referred to as a first photosensitive layer formed on one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer hereinafter referred to as a second photosensitive layer formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A.

In the step S of the photosensitive material is exposed. In this step a simultaneous both side exposure which includes a first exposure treatment for irradiating the first photosensitive layer on the first transparent substrate A with a light in a first exposure pattern and a second exposure treatment for irradiating the second photosensitive layer on the first transparent substrate A with a light in a second exposure pattern is carried out. In the example of the first photosensitive layer is irradiated through a first photomask with a first light a parallel light and the second photosensitive layer is irradiated through a second photomask with a second light a parallel light while conveying the long photosensitive material in one direction. The first light is such that a light from a first light source is converted to a parallel light by an intermediate first collimator lens and the second light is such that a light from a second light source is converted to a parallel light by an intermediate second collimator lens . Though two light sources the first light source and the second light source are used in the example of only one light source may be used. In this case a light from the one light source may be divided by an optical system into the first light and the second light for exposing the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer

In the step S of the exposed photosensitive material is developed to prepare the touch panel conductive sheet shown in . The touch panel conductive sheet has the first transparent substrate A the first conductive patterns A formed in the first exposure pattern on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and the second conductive patterns B formed in the second exposure pattern on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A. Preferred exposure time and development time for the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer depend on the types of the first light source the second light source and a developer etc. and cannot be categorically determined. The exposure time and development time may be selected in view of achieving a development ratio of 100 .

As shown in in the first exposure treatment in the production method of this embodiment for example the first photomask is placed in close contact with the first photosensitive layer the first light source is arranged facing the first photomask and the first light is emitted from the first light source toward the first photomask so that the first photosensitive layer is exposed. The first photomask has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern a first exposure pattern formed thereon. Therefore in the first exposure treatment areas in the first photosensitive layer corresponding to the first exposure pattern in the first photomask are exposed. A space of approximately 2 to 10 m may be formed between the first photosensitive layer and the first photomask

Similarly in the second exposure treatment for example the second photomask is placed in close contact with the second photosensitive layer the second light source is arranged facing the second photomask and the second light is emitted from the second light source toward the second photomask so that the second photosensitive layer is exposed. The second photomask as well as the first photomask has a glass substrate composed of a transparent soda glass and a mask pattern a second exposure pattern formed thereon. Therefore in the second exposure treatment areas in the second photosensitive layer corresponding to the second exposure pattern in the second photomask are exposed. In this case a space of approximately 2 to 10 m may be formed between the second photosensitive layer and the second photomask

In the first and second exposure treatments the emission of the first light from the first light source and the emission of the second light from the second light source may be carried out simultaneously or independently. In a case where the emissions are simultaneously carried out the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can be simultaneously exposed in one exposure process to reduce the treatment time.

In a case where both of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are not spectrally sensitized a light incident on one side may affect the image formation on the other side the back side in the both side exposure of the photosensitive material .

Thus the first light from the first light source reaches the first photosensitive layer and is scattered by silver halide particles in the first photosensitive layer and a part of the scattered light is transmitted through the first transparent substrate A and reaches the second photosensitive layer . Then a large area of the boundary between the second photosensitive layer and the first transparent substrate A is exposed to form a latent image. As a result the second photosensitive layer is exposed to the second light from the second light source and the first light from the first light source . If the second photosensitive layer is developed to prepare the touch panel conductive sheet the conductive pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern the second conductive pattern B is formed and additionally a thin conductive layer is formed due to the first light from the first light source between the conductive patterns so that the desired pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern cannot be obtained. This is true also for the first photosensitive layer

As a result of intense research in view of solving this problem it has been found that if the thicknesses and the applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected within particular ranges the incident light can be absorbed by the silver halide to suppress the light transmission to the back side. In this embodiment the thicknesses of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 1 to 4 m. The upper limit is preferably 2.5 m. The applied silver amounts of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer may be 5 to 20 g m.

In the above described both side contact exposure technology the exposure may be inhibited by dust or the like attached to the film surface to generate an image defect. It is known that the dust attachment can be prevented by applying a conductive substance such as a metal oxide or a conductive polymer to the film. However the metal oxide or the like remains in the processed product deteriorating the transparency of the final product and the conductive polymer is disadvantageous in storage stability etc. As a result of intense research it has been found that a silver halide layer with reduced binder content exhibits a satisfactory conductivity for static charge prevention. Thus the volume ratio of silver binder is limited in the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer . The silver binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are 1 1 or more preferably 2 1 or more.

If the thicknesses the applied silver amounts and the silver binder volume ratios of the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer are selected as described above the first light emitted from the first light source to the first photosensitive layer does not reach the second photosensitive layer as shown in . Similarly the second light emitted from the second light source to the second photosensitive layer does not reach the first photosensitive layer . As a result in the following development for producing the touch panel conductive sheet as shown in only the conductive pattern corresponding to the first exposure pattern the first conductive pattern A etc. is formed on the one main surface of the first transparent substrate A and only the conductive pattern corresponding to the second exposure pattern the second conductive pattern B etc. is formed on the other main surface of the first transparent substrate A so that the desired pattern can be obtained.

In the production method using the above one shot both side exposure the first photosensitive layer and the second photosensitive layer can have both of the satisfactory conductivity and both side exposure suitability and the same or different patterns can be formed on the sides of the first transparent substrate A by one exposure treatment whereby the electrodes of the touch panel can be easily formed and the touch panel can be made thinner smaller .

In the above production method the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B are formed using the photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer. The other production methods include the following methods.

That is photoresist films on copper foils formed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be exposed and developed to form a resist pattern and the copper foil exposed from the resist pattern may be etched to obtain the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B.

Alternatively paste containing fine metal particles may be printed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B and the printed paste may be plated with a metal to obtain the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B.

The first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be printed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B by using a screen or gravure printing plate.

A particularly preferred method which contains using a photographic photosensitive silver halide material for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B according to an embodiment of the present invention will be mainly described below.

The method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment includes the following three processes depending on the photosensitive materials and development treatments.

 1 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei to a chemical or thermal development to form the metallic silver portions on the photosensitive material.

 2 A process comprising subjecting a photosensitive black and white silver halide material having a silver halide emulsion layer containing physical development nuclei to a solution physical development to form the metallic silver portions on the photosensitive material.

 3 A process comprising subjecting a stack of a photosensitive black and white silver halide material free of physical development nuclei and an image receiving sheet having a non photosensitive layer containing physical development nuclei to a diffusion transfer development to form the metallic silver portions on the non photosensitive image receiving sheet.

In the process of 1 an integral black and white development procedure is used to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. The resulting silver is a chemically or thermally developed silver containing a high specific surface area filament and thereby shows a high activity in the following plating or physical development treatment.

In the process of 2 the silver halide particles are melted around the physical development nuclei and deposited on the nuclei in the exposed areas to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the photosensitive material. Also in this process an integral black and white development procedure is used. Though high activity can be achieved since the silver halide is deposited on the physical development nuclei in the development the developed silver has a spherical shape with small specific surface.

In the process of 3 the silver halide particles are melted in the unexposed areas and diffused and deposited on the development nuclei of the image receiving sheet to form a transmittable conductive film such as a light transmitting conductive film on the sheet. In this process a so called separate type procedure is used and the image receiving sheet is peeled off from the photosensitive material.

A negative or reversal development treatment can be used in the processes. In the diffusion transfer development the negative development treatment can be carried out using an auto positive photosensitive material.

The chemical development thermal development solution physical development and diffusion transfer development have the meanings generally known in the art and are explained in common photographic chemistry texts such as Shin ichi Kikuchi Kyoritsu Shuppan Co. Ltd. 1955 and C. E. K. Mees 4. Mcmillan 1977. A liquid treatment is generally used in the present invention and also a thermal development treatment can be utilized. For example techniques described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Nos. 2004 184693 2004 334077 and 2005 010752 and Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2004 244080 and 2004 085655 can be used in the present invention.

The structure of each layer in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment will be described in detail below.

The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be a plastic film a plastic plate a glass plate etc.

Examples of materials for the plastic film and the plastic plate include polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalates PET and polyethylene naphthalates PEN polyolefins such as polyethylenes PE polypropylenes PP polystyrenes and EVA vinyl resins polycarbonates PC polyamides polyimides acrylic resins and triacetyl celluloses TAC .

The first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably a film or plate of a plastic having a melting point of about 290 C. or lower such as PET melting point 258 C. PEN melting point 269 C. PE melting point 135 C. PP melting point 163 C. polystyrene melting point 230 C. polyvinyl chloride melting point 180 C. polyvinylidene chloride melting point 212 C. or TAC melting point 290 C. . The PET is particularly preferred from the viewpoints of light transmittance workability etc. The transparent conductive film such as the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B used in the touch panel conductive sheet is required to be transparent and therefore the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B preferably have a high transparency.

The silver salt emulsion layer to be converted to the conductive layer in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B the conductive portions including the first large lattices A the first connections A the second large lattices B the second connections B and the small lattices contains a silver salt and a binder and may contain a solvent and an additive such as a dye in addition thereto.

The silver salt used in this embodiment may be an inorganic silver salt such as a silver halide or an organic silver salt such as silver acetate. In this embodiment the silver halide is preferred because of its excellent light sensing property.

The applied silver amount the amount of the applied silver salt in the silver density of the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1 to 30 g m more preferably 1 to 25 g m further preferably 5 to 20 g m. In a case where the applied silver amount is within this range the resultant first conductive sheet A or second conductive sheet B can exhibit a desired surface resistance.

Examples of the binders used in this embodiment include gelatins polyvinyl alcohols PVA polyvinyl pyrolidones PVP polysaccharides such as starches celluloses and derivatives thereof polyethylene oxides polyvinylamines chitosans polylysines polyacrylic acids polyalginic acids polyhyaluronic acids and carboxycelluloses. The binders show a neutral anionic or cationic property depending on the ionicity of a functional group.

In this embodiment the amount of the binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected to obtain sufficient dispersion and adhesion properties. The volume ratio of silver binder in the silver salt emulsion layer is preferably 1 4 or more more preferably 1 2 or more. Furthermore the silver binder volume ratio is preferably 100 1 or less more preferably 50 1 or less. Particularly the silver binder volume ratio is further preferably 1 1 to 4 1 most preferably 1 1 to 3 1. If the silver binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer is within the range the resistance variation can be reduced even under various applied silver amount. Thus the first conductive sheet A or the second conductive sheet B can be produced with a uniform surface resistance. The silver binder volume ratio can be obtained by converting the silver halide binder weight ratio of the material to the silver binder weight ratio and by further converting the silver binder weight ratio to the silver binder volume ratio.

The solvent used for forming the silver salt emulsion layer is not particularly limited and Examples thereof include water organic solvents e.g. alcohols such as methanol ketones such as acetone amides such as formamide sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide esters such as ethyl acetate ethers ionic liquids and mixtures thereof.

In this embodiment the ratio of the solvent to the total of the silver salt the binder and the like in the silver salt emulsion layer is 30 to 90 by mass preferably 50 to 80 by mass.

The additives used in this embodiment are not particularly limited and may be preferably selected from known additives.

A protective layer not shown may be formed on the silver salt emulsion layer. The protective layer used in this embodiment contains a binder such as a gelatin or a high molecular polymer and is disposed on the photosensitive silver salt emulsion layer to improve the scratch prevention or mechanical property. The thickness of the protective layer is preferably 0.5 m or less. The method of applying or forming the protective layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected from known applying or forming methods. In addition an undercoat layer or the like may be formed below the silver salt emulsion layer.

The steps for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B will be described below.

In this embodiment the first conductive patterns A and the second conductive patterns B may be formed in a printing process and they may be formed by exposure and development treatments etc. in another process. Thus a photosensitive material having the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B and thereon the silver salt containing layer or a photosensitive material coated with a photopolymer for photolithography is subjected to the exposure treatment. An electromagnetic wave may be used in the exposure. For example the electromagnetic wave may be a light such as a visible light or an ultraviolet light or a radiation ray such as an X ray. The exposure may be carried out using a light source having a wavelength distribution or a specific wavelength.

In this embodiment the emulsion layer is subjected to the development treatment after the exposure. Common development treatment technologies for photographic silver salt films photographic papers print engraving films emulsion masks for photomasking and the like may be used in the present invention. The developer used in the development treatment is not particularly limited and may be a PQ developer an MQ developer an MAA developer etc. Examples of commercially available developers usable in the present invention include CN 16 CR 56 CP45X FD 3 and PAPITOL available from FUJIFILM Corporation C 41 E 6 RA 4 D 19 and D 72 available from Eastman Kodak Company and developers contained in kits thereof.

In the present invention the development process may include a fixation treatment for removing the silver salt in the unexposed areas to stabilize the material.

The amount of water used in the water washing or stabilization treatment is generally 20 L or less and may be 3 L or less per 1 mof the photosensitive material. The water amount may be 0 and thus the photosensitive material may be washed with storage water.

The ratio of the metallic silver contained in the exposed areas after the development to the silver contained in the areas before the exposure is preferably 50 or more more preferably 80 or more by mass. In a case where the ratio is 50 or more by mass a high conductivity can be achieved.

In this embodiment the tone gradation obtained by the development is preferably more than 4.0 though not particularly restrictive. In a case where the tone is more than 4.0 after the development the conductivity of the conductive metal portion can be increased while maintaining the high transmittance of the light transmitting portion. For example the tone of 4.0 or more can be obtained by doping with rhodium or iridium ion.

The conductive sheet is obtained by the above steps. The surface resistance of the resultant conductive sheet is preferably within the range of 0.1 to 100 ohm sq. The lower limit is preferably 1 ohm sq or more preferably 10 ohm sq. The upper limit is preferably 70 ohm sq or more preferably 50 ohm sq. The conductive sheet may be subjected to a calender treatment after the development treatment to obtain a desired surface resistance.

In this embodiment to increase the conductivity of the metallic silver portion formed by the above exposure and development treatments conductive metal particles may be deposited thereon by a physical development treatment and or a plating treatment. In the present invention the conductive metal particles may be deposited on the metallic silver portion by only one of the physical development and plating treatments or by the combination of the treatments. The metallic silver portion subjected to the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment in this manner is also referred to as the conductive metal portion.

In this embodiment the physical development is such a process that metal ions such as silver ions are reduced by a reducing agent whereby metal particles are deposited on a metal or metal compound core. Such physical development has been used in the fields of instant B W film instant slide film printing plate production etc. and the technologies can be used in the present invention.

The physical development may be carried out at the same time as the above development treatment after the exposure and may be carried out after the development treatment separately.

In this embodiment the plating treatment may contain electroless plating such as chemical reduction plating or displacement plating electrolytic plating or a combination thereof. Known electroless plating technologies for printed circuit boards etc. may be used in this embodiment. The electroless plating is preferably electroless copper plating.

In this embodiment the metallic silver portion formed by the development treatment and the conductive metal portion formed by the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment are preferably subjected to an oxidation treatment. For example by the oxidation treatment a small amount of a metal deposited on the light transmitting portion can be removed so that the transmittance of the light transmitting portion can be increased to approximately 100 .

In this embodiment the lower limit of the line width of the conductive metal portion the line width of the thin metal wire is preferably 1 m or more 3 m or more 4 m or more or 5 m or more and the upper limit thereof is preferably 15 m 10 m or less 9 m or less or 8 m or less. The line distance is preferably 30 to 500 more preferably 50 to 400 m most preferably 100 to 350 m. The conductive metal portion may have a part with a line width of more than 200 m for the purpose of ground connection etc.

In this embodiment the opening ratio of the conductive metal portion is preferably 85 or more more preferably 90 or more most preferably 95 or more in view of the visible light transmittance. The opening ratio is the ratio of the light transmitting portions other than the conductive portions including the first large lattices A the first connections A the second large lattices B the second connections B and the small lattices to the whole. For example a square lattice having a line width of 15 m and a pitch of 300 m has an opening ratio of 90 .

In this embodiment the light transmitting portion is a portion having light transmittance other than the conductive metal portions in the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B. As described above the transmittance of the light transmitting portion which is herein a minimum transmittance value in a wavelength region of 380 to 780 nm obtained neglecting the light absorption and reflection of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B is 90 or more preferably 95 or more more preferably 97 or more further preferably 98 or more most preferably 99 or more.

The exposure is preferably carried out using a glass mask method or a laser lithography exposure method.

In the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment the thicknesses of the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B are preferably 5 to 350 m more preferably 30 to 150 m. In a case where the thicknesses are 5 to 350 m a desired visible light transmittance can be obtained and the substrates can be easily handled.

The thickness of the metallic silver portion formed on the first transparent substrate A and the second transparent substrate B may be appropriately selected by controlling the thickness of the coating liquid for the silver salt containing layer applied to the substrate. The thickness of the metallic silver portion may be selected within a range of 0.001 to 0.2 mm and is preferably 30 m or less more preferably 20 m or less further preferably 0.01 to 9 m most preferably 0.05 to 5 m. The metallic silver portion is preferably formed in a patterned shape. The metallic silver portion may have a monolayer structure or a multilayer structure containing two or more layers. In a case where the metallic silver portion has a patterned multilayer structure containing two or more layers the layers may have different wavelength color sensitivities. In this case different patterns can be formed in the layers by using exposure lights with different wavelengths.

For use in a touch panel the conductive metal portion preferably has a smaller thickness. As the thickness is reduced the viewing angle and visibility of the display panel are improved. Thus the thickness of the layer of the conductive metal on the conductive metal portion is preferably less than 9 m more preferably 0.1 m or more but less than 5 m further preferably 0.1 m or more but less than 3 m.

In this embodiment the thickness of the metallic silver portion can be controlled by changing the coating thickness of the silver salt containing layer and the thickness of the conductive metal particle layer can be controlled in the physical development treatment and or the plating treatment whereby the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B having a thickness of less than 5 m preferably less than 3 m can be easily produced.

The plating or the like is not necessarily carried out in the method for producing the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B of this embodiment. This is because the desired surface resistance can be obtained by controlling the applied silver amount and the silver binder volume ratio of the silver salt emulsion layer in the method. The calender treatment or the like may be carried out if necessary.

It is preferred that after the silver salt emulsion layer is developed the resultant is immersed in a hardener and thus subjected to a film hardening treatment. Examples of the hardeners include boric acid 2 3 dihydroxy 1 4 dioxane and dialdehydes such as glutaraldehyde and adipaldehyde described in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 02 141279.

The surface resistances of the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B were 5 ohm sq each. It was found that the first conductive sheet A and the second conductive sheet B were fully applicable to a projected capacitive touch panel having an A4 size.

The touch panel conductive sheet had no confirmed thickened lines and black points and had good visibility.

It is to be understood that the conductive sheet the conductive sheet using method and the touch panel of the present invention are not limited to the above embodiments and various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the present invention.
