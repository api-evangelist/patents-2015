This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 a of a Korean patent application filed on Mar. 19 2014 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office and assigned Serial number 10 2014 0032059 the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates to provision of information. More specifically the present disclosure relates to a method of providing information using a barcode and an electronic device thereof.

One dimensional 1D barcodes have one dimensional constitution including only numeric information of up to about 20 numbers in a horizontal direction. In order to overcome the limitation in data capacity of the 1D barcodes two dimensional 2D barcodes were obtained by coding a large quantity of information such as texts numbers and photos as 2D high density symbols in a small rectangle. For example 1D barcodes represent numeric data of 13 to 14 digits whereas 2D barcodes can contain data of 1000 characters or more. In addition 2D barcodes can represent all foreign languages including the Korean language and graphic information including fingerprints.

Quick Response QR codes are the most frequently used 2D barcodes. Typical QR code scanners provide a QR code scan function only through a camera. Due to characteristics of a camera QR codes scanned in a preview state are temporarily stored in a buffer and then deleted without being stored in a memory. More specifically among a plurality of preview images temporarily stored in a buffer for a certain period of time only the final preview image selected by a capture request using a camera shutter key is stored in a memory and the preview images not captured although temporarily stored in the buffer for the certain period of time are deleted.

For example when QR codes are scanned according to the related art the QR codes are not stored in a memory. Therefore in order to scan the same QR codes again next time the QR codes have to be captured again in a preview state by activating a camera.

Therefore a need exists for a method of providing information using a barcode and an electronic device thereof.

The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the present disclosure. No determination has been made and no assertion is made as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the present disclosure.

Therefore even if a barcode image is sent to a counterpart s terminal for sharing of the barcode the counterpart cannot scan the barcode image with his her own terminal and has to scan the barcode image with another terminal.

Furthermore a typical barcode scanner can scan only one barcode at a time. As a result in case of an advertisement with a plurality of advertising items and barcodes on one side thereof a user has to scan the plural barcodes several times. When the user wants to scan all the barcodes displayed on the advertisement posted on a wall the user may not escape from the place for a long time until completely scanning the barcodes.
