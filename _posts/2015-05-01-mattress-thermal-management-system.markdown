Additional features of the disclosure may become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings examples and appended claims.

While the disclosed apparatus and methods and are susceptible of embodiments in various forms specific embodiments of the disclosure are illustrated and will hereafter be described with the understanding that the disclosure is intended to be illustrative and is not intended to limit the claims to the specific embodiments described and illustrated herein.

The disclosure generally relates to a mattress thermal management system for example a mattress cooling system and in particular a suction based cooling system. In other embodiments the mattress thermal management system can operate as a mattress heating system. Deck mounted fans beneath a mattress operate in various embodiments to induce a uniform suction flow or a combined suction discharge circulating flow that enhances the cooling or heating rate of the mattress. Suitably air is used as the fluid heat transfer medium whether the system is operating for mattress cooling or heating. In other embodiments a gaseous fluid other than air may be used as a fluid heat transfer medium circulated by the deck mounted fans e.g. alone or in combination with air . Accordingly references in the following description to air and airflow apply as well to various other gaseous heat transfer fluids more generally. The mattress cooling system can be incorporated into a conventional mattress bed system or into an adjustable bed system.

The mattress deck includes a deck support platform for example including a plurality of deck support platforms A D as illustrated. A single unitary deck support platform is suitable for a conventional non adjustable bed assembly. A deck support platform formed from a plurality of deck support platforms A D is suitable for an adjustable bed assembly. In some embodiments the support platform s can be formed from a rigid support material such as wood or metal. In other embodiments the support platform s can be formed from a flexible fabric or material. The deck support platform includes a fan e.g. axial fan centrifugal fan cross flow fan or other means for blowing or otherwise transporting air or gaseous fluid mounted thereto for example plurality of fans A D as illustrated. While each deck support platform A D is illustrated as having a corresponding fan A D each platform A D can have none one or more than one corresponding fans mounted thereto. Each fan is mounted to the deck adjacent to within or otherwise in fluid communication with a corresponding airflow channel thereby permitting airflow through the mattress the airflow spacer when present and the mattress deck i.e. via the airflow channel and the fan in either direction.

Each fan has a suction side i.e. a fan surface plane across which air is drawn from the external environment into the fan interior and a discharge side i.e. a fan surface plane across which air is expelled from the fan interior to the external environment . As illustrated the fan can be mounted on its suction side to the deck support platform thereby creating a suction air flow during fan operation drawing air through the mattress and expelling the air beneath the deck support platform to the external environment underneath the bed. As alternatively illustrated the fan can be mounted on its discharge side to the deck support platform thereby creating a discharge air flow during fan operation drawing air from the external environment underneath the bed through the deck support platform and then through the mattress . In some embodiments the fans A D are all mounted in the same suction discharge orientation e.g. all mounted on their suction sides to the platform all mounted on their discharge sides to the platform . In other embodiments the fans A D are mounted in a mixed suction discharge orientation e.g. some mounted on their suction sides to the platform and some mounted on their discharge sides to the platform . In some embodiments some or all of the fans A D are unidirectional fans i.e. having fixed suction and discharge sides being intended to transport air in a single direction . In some embodiments some or all of the fans A D are bidirectional fans i.e. having variable suction and discharge sides depending on impeller rotation being capable of transporting air in two different opposing directions .

The airflow spacer can be any type of structure that includes an open void volume permitting airflow therethrough and directing the airflow to improve the spatial distribution e.g. uniformity thereof of airflow through the mattress e.g. in particular when the fans A D are positioned at discrete non uniformly spaced locations in the deck support platform . Suitably the airflow spacer is a formed from a flexible material to accommodate a moveable deck support platform of an adjustable bed. Suitable structure for the airflow spacer includes a mesh fabric e.g. three dimensional fabric or other porous material a manifold structure a duct structure a channel structure and a cavity structure. In some embodiments the airflow spacer is a separate structure from the mattress and the mattress deck . In other embodiments the airflow spacer can be an integral component of the mattress deck e.g. with the platform s thereof or it can be an integral component of the mattress e.g. with the base thereof .

The mattress is not particularly limited and it can be a conventional mattress e.g. a spring or coil mattress memory foam mattress air mattress with a base e.g. a continuous fabric material suitable for use on a mattress support structure such as a fixed bed frame or an adjustable bed frame. In the illustrated embodiment the mattress includes a mattress containment frame including a plurality of foam cells or foam springs positioned in the frame to provide the sleeping support surface for the mattress. The mattress containment frame includes a lower bottom base sidewalls and endwalls which generally define the interior frame volume housing the foam cells . The sidewalls and endwalls suitably are formed from a foam material. The base can be a generally continuous fabric material e.g. a continuous surface but sufficiently thin and porous at a small scale to permit airflow therethrough between the mattress and the airflow spacer such as a fabric material . In some embodiments the base can include one or more larger open areas e.g. airflow channels to enhance the rate of airflow therethrough between the mattress and the airflow spacer . The mattress and optionally the airflow spacer e.g. as a separate or integral component of the mattress are generally positioned above the mattress support for example sitting directly atop the deck support sections A D.

In some embodiments the controller is a combined controller providing power and send receive command control functionality to both the adjustable bed frame e.g. repositioning commands power to actuators etc. and the thermal management system e.g. thermal management commands power to fans etc. . In other embodiments the controller can include two separate controller structures a first controller providing power and send receive command control functionality to the adjustable bed frame and a second controller providing power and send receive command control functionality to the thermal management system . In such embodiments the first and second controllers can be electronically connected e.g. wired or wireless connection for example in a master slave arrangement. For example the first controller can be a master controller capable of receiving commands from the remote for both the adjustable bed frame and the thermal management system and then the first controller can pass commands for the thermal management system to the second controller for execution. In other embodiments each of the first and second controllers may be configured to independently receive and execute commands from the remote .

The remote control is not particularly limited. In an embodiment the remote includes a touch screen to receive user commands e.g. regarding adjustable bed position fan operation heating cooling modes timing of same etc. and or to display to the user the current status of the adjustable bed position and or the thermal management system e.g. reflecting confirmation of successfully executed commands as sensed and reported by the controller . In some embodiments the remote can be a wired unit connected to the controller for example a dedicated remote for the adjustable bed. In other embodiments the remote can include a wireless transceiver for communication e.g. two way communication with a corresponding transceiver in the controller . Any suitable wireless communication protocol may be used to send commands from the remote to the controller e.g. and optionally to receive feedback from the confirming successful execution of the sent commands for example including infrared IR and or radio frequency RF e.g. WIFI BLUETOOTH or otherwise wireless protocols. In some embodiments the wireless remote can be communication matched with the controller for example using a communication key or code key transmitted and received between the remote and controller to confirm that the controller may receive and execute user commands from the remote e.g. further including a confirmation from the controller to the remote that the communication key or code key has been received and accepted . The wireless remote can be a dedicated remote for the adjustable bed. In other embodiments the wireless remote can be a mobile electronic device e.g. cell phone smart phone tablet computer running a software application providing a user interface for control of adjustable bed functions and or thermal management system functions. The remote also can implement various memory functions associated with the adjustable bed and or thermal management system for example using memory stored settings related to the same in one or more of the remote the controller and a location separate from the remote and the controller e.g. at a remote network location . Memory settings related to adjustable bed position thermal management settings e.g. fan speed duration start stop time temperature set point or both can be stored in memory e.g. based on a user indication to save one or more settings as presets for later recall using the remote and the memory settings can be recalled at a later time by the remote as command for execution by the controller . In some embodiments the memory setting can relate to a single setting e.g. an adjustable bed position a thermal management setting . In other embodiments the memory setting can represent a global command relating to multiple settings e.g. one or more adjustable bed positions for multiple bed segments one or more thermal management settings combinations thereof etc. .

The thermal mattress system can further include one or more temperature sensors e.g. a thermocouple or other suitable conventional means for sensing temperature . The sensor s can be located at any desired location s in the mattress system for example on the mattress deck the airflow spacer the mattress and or the adjustable bed frame . For example the sensors s can be located on a fan surface e.g. as illustrated such as on or near an intake or exhaust surface a deck support surface e.g. bottom or top side thereof an interior or exterior surface of the airflow spacer an interior or exterior surface of the mattress or a component thereof e.g. base sidewall endwall foam cylinder top or bottom surface of mattress as a whole . The temperature sensor s can be coupled to the controller e.g. a component thereof for the thermal management system for form a temperature feedback control loop for the thermal management system . Given a temperature set point e.g. preset or selected by a user the controller can be programmed to monitor current temperature and adjust the thermal management system settings based on the set point e.g. increase or decrease heating or cooling such as by adjusting fan intensity speed fan operation duration heating cooling unit output temperature . In some embodiments a user can enter a desired set point in terms of a user sensible temperature e.g. mattress upper surface temperature ambient temperature above the mattress upper surface and the controller feedback control loop logic can be programmed to use the temperature actually sensed at a different location by the sensor as a proxy for the set point e.g. by specifying or determining a relationship between the desired set point and the sensed temperature .

As shown the fans may be irregularly spaced positioned on the underside of the mattress deck to accommodate other mechanical and or electronic bed components in particular for the adjustable bed frame . The fans can be powered and controlled by the electromechanical system of the adjustable bed e.g. illustrated via the wires from fans to the power supply programmable logic controller PLC which can provide power to the fans and can provide operating instructions to the fans for example as received from an external remote control unit for the adjustable bed . is a schematic of the bottom side of the mattress deck of showing the placement of four cooling fans as well as optional placement locations for additional fans e.g. if greater airflow is desired . is is a schematic of the bottom side of the mattress deck in alternative embodiment including one fan in the head section A and one fan in the foot section B of the mattress deck .

Other cooling embodiments for cooling the mattress of the mattress system are possible. For example in the embodiments illustrated in a cooler or cooling unit may be positioned below the mattress deck e.g. mounted thereto and or to mattress support structure therebelow such as the adjustable bed frame or a component thereof and the cooler can be positioned to cool air being fed upwards into the mattress e.g. by either fan illustrated in by the left illustrated fan in thus actively cooling the mattress . In an embodiment the cooler can be a portable cooling or air conditioning unit capable of cooled air relative to the ambient environment. Alternatively the cooler may be positioned remotely from the mattress deck or bed more generally and the cooler can direct cold air from the remote location to the fans for circulation through the mattress . The remote cooler can be a portable cooling or air conditioning unit spaced proximately to direct cold air below the mattress deck to be fed upwards into the mattress . In some embodiments the remote cooler can be an HVAC heating ventilation air conditioning system or a component thereof such as a home HVAC system configured to direct cold air below the mattress deck to be fed upwards into the mattress . In embodiments including a cooler the mattress system may be independently operated at the discretion of the user in a cooling mode using ambient environmental air e.g. as described above without the cooler being active or a cooling mode using the cold air from the cooler to cool the mattress .

In some embodiments the mattress system can be adapted to heating the mattress instead of cooling. For example in the embodiments illustrated in a heater or heating unit may be positioned below the mattress deck e.g. mounted thereto and or to mattress support structure therebelow such as the adjustable bed frame or a component thereof and the heater can be positioned to heat air being fed upwards into the mattress e.g. by either fan illustrated in by the left illustrated fan in thus actively heating the mattress . In an embodiment the heater can be a portable heating unit such as an electrically powered semiconductor based micro thermal module capable of providing radiant heat relative to the ambient environment. Alternatively the heater may be positioned remotely from the mattress deck or bed more generally and the heater can direct hot air from the remote location to the fans for circulation through the mattress . The remote heater can be a portable heating unit spaced proximately to direct hot air below the mattress deck to be fed upwards into the mattress . In some embodiments the remote heater can be an HVAC system or a component thereof e.g. where the same HVAC system is capable of providing cool air for cooling as above or hot air for heating such as a home HVAC system configured to direct hot air below the mattress deck to be fed upwards into the mattress . In embodiments including a heater the mattress system may be independently operated at the discretion of the user in either a cooling mode e.g. as described above without the heater being active or in a heating mode e.g. with the heater actively supplying heat to the airflow entering the mattress .
