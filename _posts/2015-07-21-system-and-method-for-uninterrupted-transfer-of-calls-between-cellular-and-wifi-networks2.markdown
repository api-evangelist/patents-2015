Cellular phones have been in widespread use for many years. A variety of carriers offer cellular services over networks in the United States and similar services are offered by cellular companies in most other countries around the world. The coverage of the networks of the different carriers varies widely depending on the geographic location of the user. Coverage depends on the proximity to a cellular tower delivering a cell signal to a user s mobile device. If a user is in a location that is too far away from a tower or that is blocked in some way from receiving the signal from a tower the call quality may be reduced to an unacceptable level or drop off completely.

Cell phone users are typically charged a monthly service fee for the use of a phone on the cellular network. Those charges depend on the amount of use and are usually measured in the number of minutes during each monthly cycle. To avoid running up charges and or to improve signal reception a number of products and services have been offered to transfer a cellular call on a cell phone from the cellular network to another network such as a hardwired telephone network or a WiFi network that allows the call to be transmitted over the internet or another network.

While different products and services offering these transfer capabilities are available none of them offers a seamless transfer which is accomplished without the user manually initiating such action. As a result it is desirable to have such a system and method that automatically transfers calls from a cellular network upon a user coming into range of a WiFi network.

The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art by offering a software package that may run on any number of different operating systems including but not limited to Android OS Windows Windows Mobile Linux or Blackberry. The application provides voice over internet protocol VoIP telephone services designed to supplement and or replace the existing cellular PCS or packet communication system.

The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Throughout the Figures like elements of the invention are referred to by the same reference numerals for consistency purposes.

Shown in is a system and method for transferring calls without interruption between a cellular network and a WiFi network. shows the basic system components which include one or more mobile devices such as a smartphone or other portable computing device e.g. tablet computers laptops PDAs etc. connected to a network and running an application app installed on the mobile device to perform the functions for the uninterrupted transfer of calls between a cellular network and a WiFi network or vice versa. One or more servers control call sessions and a firewall and load balancing system authenticates a user s mobile device prior to making a transfer.

A specific application app see is installed on mobile device that operates in conjunction with software installed on servers and load balancing system to enable calls to be transferred. The app provides voice communications and simple messaging service SMS functions via WiFi conforming to IEEE 802.11 standards functioning with all subversions of the standard in production or in prototype. The IEEE definition of sub OSI Open Systems Interconnection model a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the internal functions of a communication system by partition it into layers for 802.11 includes A B G N AB and AC. Because the application is adherent to full 802.11 any additional sub OTI will be supported.

The communication level of the app may be defined by the equipment manufacturer which for example may be based on the open systems interconnection OSI model as defined by CISCO at 

On the server side server software maintains session state that is control of the call. A Decode and State Functions block are outlined herein as part of the process formula. Switching and physical control functions are maintained at a data center server cluster . This process may be replicated at multiple data centers or single center capacity may be increased to increase overall system capacity.

App refers to OSI layers 3 and 4 commonly TCP and IP although UDP is also supported at layer 3 of OSI. This is the application itself that is installed to mobile device . IP communication is the physical network component that connects mobile device to cloud . This is commonly a WiFi network although any packet based standard network that conforms to OSI referenced above is usable. WiFi networks may include the public network at a restaurant or other commercial place as well as an office home or tethered configuration. In addition to WiFi Satellite WAN MAN and any other packet infrastructure is or can be supported.

Cloud is the public Internet while decode and state functions are determined at the front end of server at data center . State control is handled at decode and state functions block which allows signal detection also referred to by trademark Signal Seeker to monitor the call and switch handoff between networks as needed. This process must be completed at 2 ms or less to avoid drops. The decode and encode function refers to a variance for the subscribers mobile network. Information being decoded includes the DID number connection state connected connecting etc. as well as status such as roaming and signal strength.

Data center server cluster is the physical data center configuration. This is illustrated in detail in .

Mobile devices may run any number of different operating systems including but not limited to Android iOS Windows Windows Mobile Linux or Blackberry. App running on mobile devices functions to transfer an active call between cellular packet system and WiFi system . App is implemented in an active state format on mobile device and monitors communications in an active inactive mode on packet system . When a WiFi signal is detected in range of mobile device that is able to route calls over the internet or another platform including but not limited to a private packet switch extranet local area network municipal area network wide area network satellite network using any one or more frequency bands e.g. L C Ku Ka cellular network e.g. GSM CDMA App initiates a connection on the cloud network and drops the connection to cellular packet system . This system additionally maintains state functions for call completion allowing a transfer of originated point of termination by both cellular packet system and WiFi system communicating over cloud network .

App employs several quality of service features QOS designed to address and minimize the issue of dropped calls. Included in this feature is a signal monitoring function which will obtain active inactive state of WiFi network check the login status and once access is confirmed monitor the signal level of cell network . Once a WiFi signal strength in a range of approximately 0.5 db to 0.8 db is obtained for a period of 5 seconds app is triggered to transfer to cloud .

In addition to the auto transfer the user has a function via the interface on app to enable the user to manually set the signal strength and time for switching.

Once a cellular network signal reaches the minimum level that is the default value or as set by the user the active call is switched back to cellular packet system until the process may be repeated. The entire switching process completes in under 2 ms.

The design of the signal detection process is set to control the call via server and monitor for the status of mobile device . When a call is active on cellular network and a known wireless connection is successfully engaged server will hand off or switch the active call from cell network to WiFi network and stop incurring further charges for cellular minutes. The call on cellular network is placed in standby mode which allows the system the ability to switch it back to cellular network quickly and easily. The state of the document type definition DTD phone number is kept in standby so the call session may continue without interruption.

Another quality of service QOS function involves monitoring of hops and other latency issues on WiFi network allowing for full support of satellite and other Internet communication technologies. This feature makes the app along with the Cloud infrastructure agnostic to the actual form of communication for the wide area network i.e. as long as the device end conforms to IEEE 802.11 whatever technology completes the circuit is supported. This may include but is not limited to satellite packet radio switched data such as T1 or T3 cable modems DSL Fiber Optic Connections etc. .

Device support of the app and the cloud based infrastructure supports all current implementations that communicate with the internet protocol version X IPvX standards. This includes but is not limited to Android devices all iOS devices all Windows mobile devices all Blackberry devices all and WebOS devices. While the product app will focus on specific device operating systems based on market share it is declared that the technology itself is compatible with all IP compliant device operating systems.

System is unique and different from anything on the market today. Call transfer is performed without the device user being interrupted or having to interact in any way with mobile device . The app s internal algorithmic structure analyzes identifies determines and implements the best form of connection to adhere to the device users needs and current activities. The system is also agnostic to branded carrier environments and will support cellular packet implementation on both the global system for mobile communications GSM and code division multiple access CDMA switching standards

Cellular transceivers are mounted to tower for receiving and transmitting cellular signals to mobile devices positioned within range. A satellite transceiver complies with OSI standard for a packet network sending and receiving data to mobile device . Server is shown as a single server in . However it should be understood that system is scalable and the number of servers may be increased to handle the added load of more calls from multiple mobile devices . In addition the number of points on system configured as shown may be incremented to add coverage on the system.

Server operation has already been described with respect to and above and is a network configured to accept the handoff of a call from cellular network .

Cloud database with active state is described with respect to above and is a network connectable to mobile device by a WiFi router.

Call Active refers to the state of the user call on cellular network . When the call is flagged as active the signal detection component will attempt to hand off the call from cell network to WiFi network .

Providers network is the application programming interface API to each of the mobile providers systems. An initial version might include the largest four U.S. Providers AT T T Mobile Verizon and Sprint however the system is compatible with all digital mobile providers. Providers network is the portion of the installed application that performs the switch between the cellular network and WiFi network . When a call is initiated the direct inward dialing DID phone number is stored in active phone memory. This number is submitted to cellular network so as the call is passed between the two systems it can be maintained without having to reinitiate the call. When the call is handed off via the Signal Seeker a mode is imitated as outlined with respect to the description of monitor status block below. This function allows a call to be initiated via WiFi and remain live when switching to cellular network .

Monitor status block maintains the active and passive states of a current call. This is logged via the process as outlined below with respect to log status block . The information provided to the logging function originates here.

WiFi State and Mobile Operator State feed Monitor Status which operates along with call active to maintain the status of the active call.

Dialer interfaces with the dial function of mobile device when present or presents a substitute on devices that do not have mobile calling capability such as a personal computer. Connection shows the established connection to either WiFi network or cell network .

Init on Operator block is the status that is logged with the database shown in . More specifically this is the active status of the mobile provider the current call status the session identifier the DID of the device the international mobile equipment identity IMEI or equivalent serial number of the device and the call duration.

POTS Plain Old Telephone Service Completion block references the ability for a WiFi initiated call to be compatible with the standard telephone network. Completion allows a call initiated via the application to connect ring and be active to standard land line phones.

Log status block maintains the active status of the session. For example if a call is initiated via WiFi to a land line phone the WiFi status the land line status and the telco information are maintained at log status in real time.

State Handoff physically transfers the application call from WiFi to the mobile network operator and back in any order.

This equation shows the actual functions and conditions under which the Signal Seeker signal detection component operates.

As defined in the equation the procedure is initiated when a user places a call on cellular network . Based on the criteria in the equation above the call will be completed with cell network when available and via WiFi when it is not.

Based on the criteria below when WiFi network is active the call will be transferred to WiFi upon meeting the conditions of the equation above depending on the variables of signal strength and connection times. The range of the signal strength has H high point at approximately 1.5 db and L low point at approximately 1.8 db with a default of approximately 1.5 db. The connection time is in the approximate range between 3 seconds and 5 seconds with a default of approximately 5 seconds. Both options may be adjusted from the interface by the user in the application.

The system will also check for ports and other details per the equation above. In the event that the Layer 3 TCP cellular service is not available the call will complete and operate via the WiFi network . Wireless system uses a circular boundary with signal and deployment strengths outlined in this equation.

In practice when a user enters the signal range of a WiFi network the device will connect automatically through existing means. The problem that is solved is that when a user is on the edge of a WiFi network the device will have a default behavior of connecting to the WiFi and disconnecting from it becomes a problem that is currently present or that will be consistent in the current position. The problem can be stated as a simple equation X as X DT where D is distance and T is threshold to create a buffer zone for the WiFi network to be in operation but the call to still be on the mobile network. The buffer zone is what is referred to as tolerance. When inside this zone the call automatically switches.

The solution can be implemented using a single triangular range as shown in or it can include multiple triangular ranges layered on top of each other where different WiFi bands are present. In that case multiple X variables are determined based on different layered distances D and thresholds T. So there would be an X Dand Tdefined to be in a relationship as X DTand X Dand Tdefined to be in a relationship expressed as X DT.

On the exit of a WiFi network the signal is checked against H and L and the measured level is added to the conditions and that is why this calculation is a function for a triangulation instead of a circle. The same logic as above is applied in reverse when the user is already on WiFi to give the user a tolerance exit buffer zone when leaving the WiFi coverage area. This ensures that the call is not dropped and quality of service is maintained.

As an example where a 39.75 mand it is known that the sin 60 is 0.866 s 45.9 meters. Therefore it is necessary to expand the inter access point spacing from 42.7 meters to 45.9 meters in order to move both the top and bottom rows of outermost access points to the actual building perimeter. As this represents a relatively minor increase in inter access point spacing it should be easily accommodated by a correspondingly minor increase in transmit power if any at all. In the next step the new cell size is determined that would be required to support the recommended levels of overlap given the newly calculated inter access point spacing.

Using this new value for Signal Seeker s inter access point spacing the 67 dBm cell signal boundary is first calculated with a 15 cell to cell overlap for 802.11a. The 67 dBm cell signal boundary with a 20 cell to cell overlap is the calculated for the legacy data and voice devices that will be using 802.11bg. With the assumption that the radii of any two adjacent access point cells are equal that is R1 R2 R the equation for the area of a circle circle intersection can be used as the basis for this calculation. To determine the cell radius given that the inter access point separation and the percentage of overlap are known the following equation is used 

Either 15 for 802.11a or 10 for 802.11bg is substituted as the percentage of overlap O and 45.9 meters is substituted for the inter access point distance d. Solving for R as an approximate root of the function shown above it is determined that the cell radii is equal to 30.88 meters for a 15 cell to cell overlap using 802.11a and 33.4 meters for a 20 cell to cell overlap using 802.11bg.

At this point the information necessary to calculate the access point transmission power settings to achieve the desired cell signal boundaries are known. A calculation is performed using a form of the equation presented earlier to calculate receive signal strength TXPOWER from knowledge of the reference path loss path loss exponent transmit power and various miscellaneous receive and transmit gains and losses. As it is the transmit power TXPOWER of the access points that is required for the calculation and not the receive signal strength a modified form of the equation is used as follows Loss Gain 10 log Gain Loss

Substituting the appropriate values along with an expectation of a 67 dBm minimum receive signal strength RXPOWER for both 802.11a 802.11bg as well as the appropriate antenna gains a cell radius in meters an estimated path loss exponent n of 3.5 and the reference path losses we obtain the following results 

Note that these power levels have been rounded upward to the next available transmit power increment available on the AP1240AG access point. Since this is 1.93 dBm higher than the required transmit power to achieve a recommended 20 overlap goal at a cell signal boundary of 67 dBm it is expected that the overlap will exceed the 20 target. This is acceptable as the 20 overlap is a minimum target. Similarly for 802.11a the access point transmit power level of 14 dBm is 1.42 dBm higher than what is required to achieve the recommended 15 overlap once again resulting in more overlap between cells than expected.

In this particular case the option to expand an inter access point separation is an acceptable alternative. Due to the increase in the inter access point separation from 42.7 meters to 45.9 meters a 3 dBm increase is required to both an 802.11a and 802.11bg access point transmit power settings in order to remain in strict compliance with calculated requirements. Despite the increase in access point transmit power level additional transmit power is left in reserve on both bands to address potential coverage holes or other anomalies that could occur due to changes in the environment. If this had not been the case it would have been necessary to proceed with a second option which entails contracting inter access point spacing and introducing a sixth row of access points. The main differences in the calculations would be to divide the size of the floor by five instead of four rows of equilateral triangular formations. This would have resulted in a smaller formation height a smaller inter access point separation and therefore smaller cell to cell radii and lower transmit powers.

Signal Seeker will adhere to a formula to trigger handoff functions at a ratio of 1.6 1.8 db sustained for 5 seconds.

While the invention has been described with respect to the figures it will be appreciated that many modifications and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Any variation and derivation from the above description and drawings are included in the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims.
