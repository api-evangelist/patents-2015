System for inferring cardiac rhythm information from heart beat time series information collected by wearable sensors and system for selective transmission of electrocardiographic signal data from a wearable sensor

Abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias may cause various types of symptoms such as loss of consciousness palpitations dizziness or even death. An arrhythmia that causes such symptoms is often an indicator of significant underlying heart disease. It is important to identify when such symptoms are due to an abnormal heart rhythm since treatment with various procedures such as pacemaker implantation or percutaneous catheter ablation can successfully ameliorate these problems and prevent significant symptoms and death. For example monitors such as Holter monitors and similar devices are currently in use to monitor heart rhythms.

These and other aspects and embodiments of the invention are described in greater detail below with reference to the drawing figures.

The following description is directed to a number of various embodiments. The described embodiments however may be implemented and or varied in many different ways. For example the described embodiments may be implemented in any suitable device apparatus or system to monitor any of a number of physiological parameters. For example the following discussion focuses primarily on long term patch based cardiac rhythm monitoring devices. In one alternative embodiment a physiological monitoring device may be used for example for pulse oximetry and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The method of using a physiological monitoring device may also vary. In some cases a device may be worn for one week or less while in other cases a device may be worn for at least seven days and or for more than seven days for example between fourteen days and twenty one days or even longer. Many other alternative embodiments and applications of the described technology are possible. Thus the following description is provided for exemplary purposes only. Throughout the specification reference may be made to the term conformal. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that the term conformal as used herein refers to a relationship between surfaces or structures where a first surface or structure adapts to the contours of a second surface or structure.

Since abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias can often be due to other less serious causes a key challenge is to determine when any of these symptoms are due to an arrhythmia. Oftentimes arrhythmias occur infrequently and or episodically making rapid and reliable diagnosis difficult. As mentioned above currently cardiac rhythm monitoring is primarily accomplished through the use of devices such as Holter monitors that use short duration less than 1 day electrodes affixed to the chest. Wires connect the electrodes to a recording device usually worn on a belt. The electrodes need daily changing and the wires are cumbersome. The devices also have limited memory and recording time. Wearing the device interferes with patient movement and often precludes performing certain activities while being monitored such as bathing. Further Holter monitors are capital equipment with limited availability a situation that often leads to supply constraints and corresponding testing delays. These limitations severely hinder the diagnostic usefulness of the device the compliance of patients using the device and the likelihood of capturing all important information. Lack of compliance and the shortcomings of the devices often lead to the need for additional devices follow on monitoring or other tests to make a correct diagnosis.

Current methods to correlate symptoms with the occurrence of arrhythmias including the use of cardiac rhythm monitoring devices such as Holter monitors and cardiac event recorders are often not sufficient to allow an accurate diagnosis to be made. In fact Holter monitors have been shown to not lead to a diagnosis up to 90 of the time Assessment of the Diagnostic Value of 24 Hour Ambulatory Electrocardiographic Monitoring by D E Ward et al. Biotelemetry Patient Monitoring vol. 7 published in 1980 .

Additionally the medical treatment process to actually obtain a cardiac rhythm monitoring device and initiate monitoring is typically very complicated. There are usually numerous steps involved in ordering tracking monitoring retrieving and analyzing the data from such a monitoring device. In most cases cardiac monitoring devices used today are ordered by a cardiologist or a cardiac electrophysiologist EP rather than the patient s primary care physician PCP . This is of significance since the PCP is often the first physician to see the patient and determine that the patient s symptoms could be due to an arrhythmia. After the patient sees the PCP the PCP will make an appointment for the patient to see a cardiologist or an EP. This appointment is usually several weeks from the initial visit with the PCP which in itself leads to a delay in making a potential diagnosis as well as increases the likelihood that an arrhythmia episode will occur and go undiagnosed. When the patient finally sees the cardiologist or EP a cardiac rhythm monitoring device will usually be ordered. The monitoring period can last 24 to 48 hours Holter monitor or up to a month cardiac event monitor or mobile telemetry device . Once the monitoring has been completed the patient typically must return the device to the clinic which itself can be an inconvenience. After the data has been processed by the monitoring company or by a technician on site at a hospital or office a report will finally be sent to the cardiologist or EP for analysis. This complex process results in fewer patients receiving cardiac rhythm monitoring than would ideally receive it.

To address some of these issues with cardiac monitoring the assignee of the present application developed various embodiments of a small long term wearable physiological monitoring device. One embodiment of the device is the Zio Patch. Various embodiments are also described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8 150 502 8 160 682 8 244 335 8 560 046 and 8 538 503 the full disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Generally the physiological patch based monitors described in the above references fit comfortably on a patient s chest and are designed to be worn for at least one week and typically two to three weeks. The monitors detect and record cardiac rhythm signal data continuously while the device is worn and this cardiac rhythm data is then available for processing and analysis.

These smaller long term patch based physiological monitoring devices provide many advantages over prior art devices. At the same time further improvements are desired. One of the most meaningful areas for improvement is to offer more timely notice of critical arrhythmias to managing clinicians. The hallmark of these initial embodiments was that for reasons of performance compliance and cost the device only recorded information during the extended wear period with analysis and reporting occurring after the recording completed. Thus a desirable improvement would be to add the capability of either real time or timely analysis of the collected rhythm information. While diagnostic monitors with such timely reporting capabilities currently exist they require one or more electrical components of the system to be either regularly recharged or replaced. These actions are associated with reduced patient compliance and in turn reduced diagnostic yield. As such a key area of improvement is to develop a physiologic monitor that can combine long term recording with timely reporting without requiring battery recharging or replacement.

Patient compliance and device adhesion performance are two factors that govern the duration of the ECG record and consequently the diagnostic yield. Compliance can be increased by improving the patient s wear experience which is affected by wear comfort device appearance and the extent to which the device impedes the normal activities of daily living. Given that longer ECG records provide greater diagnostic yield and hence value improvements to device adhesion and patient compliance are desirable.

Signal quality is important throughout the duration of wear but may be more important where the patient marks the record indicating an area of symptomatic clinical significance. Marking the record is most easily enabled through a trigger located on the external surface of the device. However since the trigger may be part of a skin contacting platform with integrated electrodes the patient can introduce significant motion artifacts when feeling for the trigger. A desirable device improvement would be a symptom trigger that can be activated with minimal addition of motion artifact.

Further it is desirable for the device to be simple and cost effective to manufacture enabling scalability at manufacturing as well as higher quality due to repeatability in process. Simplicity of manufacture can also lead to ease of disassembly which enables the efficient recovery of the printed circuit board for quality controlled reuse in another device. Efficient reuse of this expensive component can be important for decreasing the cost of the diagnostic monitor.

There remain clinical scenarios where still longer duration and lower cost solutions may be a valuable addition to a portfolio of cardiac ambulatory monitoring options. Inspiration for a potential solution to these needs can be found in the continuous heart rate sensing functionality that is increasingly being incorporated in a variety of consumer health and fitness products including smart watches and wearable fitness bands. Although continuous heart rate data can be used to provide the user with information about their general fitness levels it is more both more challenging and valuable to use this data to provide meaningful information related to their health and wellness. For example the ability to detect potential arrhythmias from continuous heart rate data would enable consumer devices incorporating heart rate sensing functionality to serve as potential screening tools for the early detection of cardiac abnormalities. Such an approach could be clinically valuable in providing a long term cost effective screening method for at risk populations for example heart failure patients at risk for Atrial Fibrillation. Alternatively this monitoring approach could be helpful in the long term titration of therapeutic drug dosages to ensure efficaciousness while reducing side effects for example in the management of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation. Beyond cardiac arrhythmia detection the appropriate analysis of heart rate information could also yield insight into sleep and stress applications.

Long term ambulatory monitoring with a physiologic device such as an adhesive patch has a number of clinical applications particularly when timely information about the occurrence and duration of observed arrhythmias can be provided during the monitoring period. In terms of prevalence particularly as driven by an aging population efficiently detecting Atrial Fibrillation AF remains the most significant monitoring need. This need is not just evident for patients presenting with symptoms but also given the increased risk of stroke associated with this arrhythmia for broader population based monitoring of asymptomatic AF in individuals at risk due to one or more factors of advanced age the presence of chronic illnesses like Heart Disease or even the occurrence of surgical procedures. For the latter group both perioperative and post procedure monitoring can be clinically valuable and not just for procedures targeted at arrhythmia prevention for example the MAZE ablation procedure or hybrid endo and epicardial procedures both for treatment of AF but also for general surgeries involving anesthesia. For some applications the goal of ambulatory monitoring for Atrial Fibrillation will sometimes be focused on the simple binary question of yes or no did AF occur in a given time period. For example monitoring a patient following an ablation procedure will typically seek to confirm success typically defined as the complete lack of AF occurrence. Likewise monitoring a patient post stroke will be primarily concerned with evaluating the presence of Atrial Fibrillation.

However even in those scenarios if AF occurs it may be clinically meaningful to evaluate additional aspects to better characterize the occurrence such as daily burden of time in AF each day and duration of episodes expressed for example as a histogram of episode duration or as the percentage of episodes that extend beyond a specified limit say six minutes both either in absolute terms or in comparison to prior benchmarks for example from a baseline pre procedure monitoring result . Indeed measuring daily AF burden evaluating AF episode duration and reviewing AF occurrence during sleep and waking periods and evaluating the presence of AF in response to the degree of a patient s physical movement can be important in a variety of clinical scenarios including evaluating the effectiveness of drug based treatment for this arrhythmia.

Making this information available in a timely manner during the monitoring period could allow the managing physician to iteratively titrate treatment for example by adjusting the dosage and frequency of a novel oral anticoagulant drug NOAC until management was optimized. A further example of this management paradigm is for the patient to be notified of asymptomatic AF either directly by the device through audible or vibration based alert through notification from an application connected to the device or via phone email or text message communication from the managing clinician for the timely application of a pill in the pocket for AF management.

The theme of timely management and or intervention is certainly evident in situations where clinically significant arrhythmias are observed for example asymptomatic second degree and complete Heart Block extended pauses high rate supraventricular tachycardias prolonged ventricular tachycaridas and ventricular fibrillation. For example the clinical scenario where an extended pause or complete heart block causes Syncope is a particularly significant case where the availability of a timely and dependable monitoring method could reduce or even eliminate the need for in hospital monitoring of at risk patients. The theme can also extend to more subtle changes in morphology for example QT prolongation in response to medications which has been shown to have significant cardiac safety implications. Timely awareness of such prolongation could lead for example to early termination of clinical studies evaluating drug safety and effectiveness or alternatively to adjusting the dosage or frequency as a means to eliminate observed prolongation.

Referring to perspective and exploded profile views of one embodiment of a physiological monitoring device are provided. As seen in physiological monitoring device may include a flexible body coupled with a watertight rigid housing . Flexible body which may be referred to as flexible substrate or flexible construct typically includes two wings which extend laterally from rigid housing and two flexible electrode traces each of which is embedded in one of wings . Each electrode trace is coupled on the bottom surface of flexible body with a flexible electrode not visible in . The electrodes are configured to sense heart rhythm signals from a patient to which monitoring device is attached. Electrode traces then transmit those signals to electronics not visible in housed in rigid housing . Rigid housing also typically contains a power source such as one or more batteries.

The combination of a highly flexible body including flexible electrodes and electrode traces with a very rigid housing may provide a number of advantages. A key advantage is high fidelity signal capture. The highly conformal and flexible wings electrodes and traces limit the transmission of external energy to the electrode skin interface. If motion is imparted to the rigid housing for example the system of conformal adhesion to the skin limits the extent to which that motion affects the monitored signal. Flexible electrode traces generally may help provide conformal contact with the subject s skin and may help prevent electrodes electrodes are not visible in but are visible in described below from peeling or lifting off of the skin thereby providing strong motion artifact rejection and better signal quality by minimizing transfer of stress to electrodes . Furthermore flexible body includes a configuration and various features that facilitate comfortable wearing of device by a patient for fourteen 14 days or more without removal. Rigid housing which typically does not adhere to the patient in the embodiments described herein includes features that lend to the comfort of device . Hinge portions are relatively thin even more flexible portions of flexible body . They allow flexible body to flex freely at the area where it is joined to rigid housing . This flexibility enhances comfort since when the patient moves housing can freely lift off of the patient s skin. Electrode traces are also very thin and flexible to allow for patient movement without signal distortion.

Referring now to a partially exploded view of physiological monitoring device illustrates component parts that make up and that are contained within rigid housing in greater detail. In this embodiment rigid housing includes an upper housing member which detachably couples with a lower housing member . Sandwiched between upper housing member and lower housing member are an upper gasket and a lower gasket not visible on but just below upper gasket . Gaskets help make rigid housing member watertight when assembled. A number of components of monitoring device may be housed between upper housing member and lower housing member . For example in one embodiment housing may contain a portion of flexible body a printed circuit board assembly PCBA a battery holder and two batteries . Printed circuit board assembly is positioned within housing to contact electrode traces and batteries . In various embodiments one or more additional components may be contained within or attached to rigid housing . Some of these optional components are described further below in reference to additional drawing figures.

Battery holder according to various alternative embodiments may hold two batteries as in the illustrated embodiment one battery or more than two batteries. In other alternative embodiments other power sources may be used. In the embodiment shown battery holder includes multiple retain tabs for holding batteries in holder . Additionally battery holder includes multiple feet to establish correct spacing of batteries from the surface of PCBA and ensure proper contact with spring fingers and . Spring fingers and are used in this embodiment rather than soldering batteries to PCBA . Although soldering may be used in alternative embodiments one advantage of spring fingers and is that they allow batteries to be removed from PCBA and holder without damaging either of those components thus allowing for multiple reuses of both. Eliminating solder connections also simplifies and speeds up assembly and disassembly of monitoring device .

In some embodiments upper housing member may act as a patient event trigger. When a patient is wearing physiological monitoring device for cardiac rhythm monitoring it is typically advantageous for the patient to be able to register with device for example log into the device s memory any cardiac events perceived by the patient. If the patient feels what he she believes to be an episode of heart arrhythmia for example the patient may somehow trigger device and thus provide a record of the perceived event. In some embodiments trigger of perceived events by the patient may initiate transmission of data associated with the triggered event. In some embodiments trigger of perceived events may simply mark a continuous record with the location of the triggered event. In some embodiments both transmission of associated data as well as marking of the continuous record may occur. At some later time the patient s recorded symptom during the perceived event could be compared with the patient s actual heart rhythm recorded by device and this may help determine whether the patient s perceived events correlate with actual cardiac events. One problem with patient event triggers in currently available wearable cardiac rhythm monitoring devices however is that a small trigger may be hard to find and or activate especially since the monitoring device is typically worn under clothing. Additionally pressing a trigger button may affect the electronics and or the electrodes on the device in such a way that the recorded heart rhythm signal at that moment is altered simply by the motion caused to the device by the patient triggering. For example pressing a trigger may jar one or both of the electrodes in such a way that the recorded heart rhythm signal at that moment appears like an arrhythmia even if no actual arrhythmia event occurred. Additionally there is a chance that the trigger may be inadvertently activated for instance while sleeping or laying on the monitoring device.

In the embodiment shown in however rigid housing is sufficiently rigid and flexible body is sufficiently flexible that motion applied to housing by a patient may rarely or ever cause an aberrant signal to be sensed by the electrodes. In this embodiment the central portion of upper housing member is slightly concave and when pressed by a patient who is wearing device this central portion depresses slightly to trigger a trigger input on PCBA . Because the entire upper surface of rigid housing acts as the patient event trigger combined with the fact that it is slightly concave it will generally be quite easy for a patient to find and push down the trigger even under clothing. Additionally the concave nature of the button allows it to be recessed which protects it from inadvertent activations. Thus the present embodiment may alleviate some of the problems encountered with patient event triggers on currently available heart rhythm monitors. These and other aspects of the features shown in will be described in further detail below.

Referring now to the embodiments in printed circuit board assembly or PCBA may include a top surface a bottom surface a patient trigger input and spring contacts and . Printed circuit board assembly may be used to mechanically support and electrically connect electronic components using conductive pathways tracks or electrode traces . Furthermore because of the sensitive nature of PCBA and the requirement to mechanically interface with rigid body it is beneficial to have PCBA be substantially rigid enough to prevent unwanted deflections which may introduce noise or artifact into the ECG signal. This is especially possible during patient trigger activations when a force is transmitted through rigid body and into PCBA . One way to ensure rigidity of the PCBA is in some embodiments to ensure that the thickness of the PCBA is relatively above a certain value. For example a thickness of at least about 0.08 cm is desirable and more preferably a thickness of at least about 0.17 cm is desirable. In this application PCBA may also be referred to as or substituted with a printed circuit board PCB printed wiring board PWB etched wiring board or printed circuit assembly PCA . In some embodiments a wire wrap or point to point construction may be used in addition to or in place of PCBA . PCBA may include analog circuits and digital circuits.

Patient trigger input may be configured to relay a signal from a patient trigger such as upper housing member described above to PCBA . For example patient trigger input may be a PCB switch or button that is responsive to pressure from the patient trigger for example the upper surface of upper housing portion . In various embodiments patient trigger input may be a surface mounted switch a tactile switch an LED illuminated tactile switch or the like. In some embodiments patient trigger input may also activate an indicator such as an LED. Certain embodiments may involve a remotely located trigger such as on a separate device or as a smart phone app.

One important challenge in collecting heart rhythm signals from a human or animal subject with a small two electrode physiological monitoring device such as device described herein is that having only two electrodes can sometimes provide a limited perspective when trying to discriminate between artifact and clinically significant signals. For example when a left handed patient brushes her teeth while wearing a small two electrode physiological monitoring device on her left chest the tooth brushing may often introduce motion artifact that causes a recorded signal to appear very similar to Ventricular Tachycardia a serious heart arrhythmia. Adding additional leads and hence vectors is the traditional approach toward mitigating this concern but this is typically done by adding extra wires adhered to the patient s chest in various locations such as with a Holter monitor. This approach is not consistent with a small wearable long term monitor such as physiological monitoring device .

An alternate approach to the problem described above is to provide one or more additional data channels to aid signal discrimination. In some embodiments for example device may include a data channel for detecting patch motion. In certain embodiments an accelerometer or other suitable device may provide patch motion by simply analyzing the change in magnitude of a single axis measurement or alternatively of the combination of all three axes. The accelerometer may record device motion at a sufficient sampling rate to allow algorithmic comparison of its frequency spectrum with that of the recorded ECG signal. If there is a match between the motion and recorded signal it is clear that the device recording in that time period is not from a clinical for example cardiac source and thus that portion of the signal can be confidently marked as artifact. This technique may be particularly useful in the tooth brushing motion example aforementioned where the rapid frequency of motion as well as the high amplitude artifact is similar to the heart rate and morphology respectively of a potentially life threatening arrhythmia like Ventricular Tachycardia. Other suitable devices described herein this section and elsewhere in the specification may also be utilized to provide motion information.

In some embodiments using the magnitude of all three axes for such an analysis would smooth out any sudden changes in values due to a shift in position rather than a change in activity. In other embodiments there may be some advantage in using a specific axis of measurement such as along the longitudinal axis of the body to focus on a specific type of artifact introduced by upward and downward movements associated with walking or running. In a similar vein the use of a gyroscope in conjunction with the accelerometer may provide further resolution as to the nature of the motion experienced. While whole body movements may be sufficiently analyzed with an accelerometer on its own specific motion of interest such as rotational motion due to arm movement is sufficiently complex that an accelerometer alone might not be able to distinguish.

In addition to detecting motion artifact an accelerometer tuned to the dynamic range of human physical activities may provide activity levels of the patient during the recording which can also enhance accuracy of algorithmic true arrhythmia detection. Given the single lead limitation of device arrhythmias that require observation of less prominent waves for example P wave in addition to rate changes such as Supraventricular Tachycardia pose challenges to both computerized algorithms as well as the trained human eye. This particular arrhythmia is also characterized by the sudden nature of its onset which may be more confidently discriminated from a non pathological Sinus Tachycardia if a sudden surge in the patient s activity level is detected at the same time as the increase in heart rate. Broadly speaking the provision of activity information to clinical professionals may help them discriminate between exercise induced arrhythmia versus not. As with motion artifact detection a single axis accelerometer measurement optimized to a particular orientation may aid in more specifically determining the activity type such as walking or running. This additional information may help explain symptoms more specifically and thereby affect the subsequent course of therapeutic action.

In certain embodiments an accelerometer with 3 axes may confer advantages beyond what magnitude of motions can provide. When the subject is not rapidly moving 3 dimensional accelerometer readings may approximate the tilt of PCBA and therefore body orientation relative to its original orientation. The original body orientation can be assumed to be in either an upright or supine position which is required for appropriate positioning and application of the device to the body. This information may aid in ruling out certain cardiac conditions that manifest as beat to beat morphology changes such as cardiac alternans where periodic amplitude changes are observed often in heart failure cases. Similar beat to beat morphology changes are observable in healthy subjects upon shift in body position due to the shift in heart position relative to the electrode vector for example from an upright to a slouching position. By design the single channel device does not have an alternate ECG channel to easily rule out potential pathological shifts in morphology however correlation with shifts in body orientation will help explain these normal changes and avoid unnecessary treatment due to false diagnosis.

In other embodiments the accelerometer may also be used as a sleep indicator based on body orientation and movement. When presenting clinical events for example pauses it is diagnostically helpful to be able to present information in a manner that clearly separates events that occurred during sleep from those during waking hours. In fact certain algorithms such as for ECG derived respiratory rate only make sense to run when the patient is in a relatively motionless state and therefore subtle signal modulation introduced by chest movement due to breathing is observable. Respiratory rate information is useful as one channel of information necessary to detect sleep apnea in certain patient populations.

In certain embodiments the accelerometer may also be used to detect free falls such as fainting. With an accelerometer device may be able to mark fainting syncope and other free fall events without relying on patient trigger. In some embodiments such free fall event triggers may initiate transmission of associated data. In order to allow timely detection of such critical events yet considering the battery and memory limitations of a small wearable device such as device acquisition of accelerometer readings may be done in bursts where only interesting information such as a potential free fall is written to memory at a high sampling rate. An expansion of this event trigger concept is to use specific tapping motions on device as a patient trigger instead of or in conjunction with the button previously described. The use and detection of multiple types of tapping sequences may provide better resolution and accuracy into what exactly the patient was feeling instead of relying on the patient to manually record their symptom and duration in a trigger log after the fact. An example of such added resolution is to indicate the severity of the symptom by the number of sequential taps.

Alternatively in other embodiments optical sensors may be used to distinguish between device motion and patient body motion. Further in additional embodiments the device may not require a button or trigger. In still more embodiments suitable devices described herein this section or elsewhere in the specification may also be used.

Another optional data channel that may be added to physiological monitoring device is a channel for detecting flex and or bend of device . In various embodiments for example device may include a strain gauge piezoelectric sensor or optical sensor to detect motion artifact in device itself and thus help to distinguish between motion artifact and cardiac rhythm data. Yet another optional data channel for device may be a channel for detecting heart rate. For example a pulse oximeter microphone or stethoscope may provide heart rate information. Redundant heart rate data may facilitate discrimination of ECG signals from artifact. This is particularly useful in cases where arrhythmia such as Supraventricular Tachycardia is interrupted by artifact and decisions must be made whether the episode was actually multiple shorter episodes or one sustained episode. Another data channel may be included for detecting ambient electrical noise. For example device may include an antenna for picking up electromagnetic interference. Detection of electromagnetic interference may facilitate discrimination of electrical noise from real ECG signals. Any of the above described data channels may be stored to support future noise discrimination or applied for immediate determination of clinical validity in real time.

With reference now to the embodiments of flexible body is shown in greater detail. As illustrated in flexible body may include wings a thin border or rim or edge around at least part of each wing electrode traces and a hinge portion or shoulder at or near a junction of each wing with rigid housing . Also shown in is upper gasket which is not considered part of flexible body for this description but which facilitates attachment of flexible body to rigid housing .

Hinge portions are relatively thin even more flexible portions of flexible body . They allow flexible body to flex freely at the area where it is joined to rigid housing . This flexibility enhances comfort since when the patient moves housing can freely lift off of the patient s skin. Electrode traces are also very thin and flexible to allow for patient movement without signal distortion. Borders are portions of flexible body that is thinner than immediately adjacent portions and that provide for a smooth transition from flexible body to a patient s skin thus preventing edge lift and penetration of dirt or debris below flexible body .

As shown in greater detail in flexible body may include multiple layers. As mentioned previously in some embodiments upper gasket and lower gasket are not considered part of flexible body for the purposes of this description but are shown for completeness of description. This distinction is for ease of description only however and should not be interpreted to limit the scope of the described embodiments. Flexible body may include a top substrate layer a bottom substrate layer an adhesive layer and flexible electrodes . Top and bottom substrate layers may be made of any suitable flexible material such as one or more flexible polymers. Suitable flexible polymers can include but are not limited to polyurethane polyethylene polyester polypropylene nylon teflon and carbon impregnated vinyl. The material of substrate layers may be selected based on desired characteristics. For example the material of substrate layers may be selected for flexibility resilience durability breathability moisture transpiration adhesion and or the like. In one embodiment for example top substrate layer may be made of polyurethane and bottom substrate layer may be made of polyethylene or alternatively polyester. In other embodiments substrate layers may be made of the same material. In yet another embodiment substrate layer may contain a plurality of perforations in the area over adhesive layer to provide for even more breathability and moisture transpiration. In various embodiments physiological monitoring device may be worn continuously by a patient for as many as 14 21 days or more without removal during the time of wear and with device being worn during showering exercising and the like. Thus the material s used and the thickness and configuration of substrate layers affect the function of physiological monitoring device . In some embodiments the material of substrate layers acts as an electric static discharge ESD barrier to prevent arcing.

Typically top and bottom substrate layers are attached to one another via adhesive placed on one or both layers . For example the adhesive or bonding substance between substrate layers may be an acrylic based rubber based or silicone based adhesive. In other alternative embodiments flexible body may include more than two layers of flexible material.

In addition to the choice of material s the dimensions thickness length and width of substrate layers may be selected based on desired characteristics of flexible body . For example in various embodiments the thickness of substrate layers may be selected to give flexible body an overall thickness of between about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 mm. According to various embodiments flexible body may also have a length of between about 7 cm and 15 cm and a width of about 3 cm and about 6 cm. Generally flexible body will have a length sufficient to provide a necessary amount of separation between electrodes . For example in one embodiment a distance from the center of one electrode to the center of the other electrode should be at least about 6.0 cm and more preferably at least about 8.5 cm. This separation distance may vary depending on the application. In some embodiments substrate layers may all have the same thickness. Alternatively the two substrate layers may have different thicknesses.

As mentioned above hinge portions allow the rigid body to lift away from the patient while flexible body remains adhered to the skin. The functionality of hinge portions is critical in allowing the device to remain adhered to the patient throughout various activities that may stretch and compress the skin. Furthermore hinge portions allow for significantly improved comfort while wearing the device. Generally hinge portions will be sufficiently wide enough to provide adequate lift of rigid body without creating too large of a peel force on flexible body . For example in various embodiments the width of hinge portion should be at least about 0.25 cm and more preferably at least about 0.75 cm.

Additionally the shape or footprint of flexible body may be selected based on desired characteristics. As seen in wings and borders may have rounded edges that give flexible body an overall peanut shape. However wings can be formed in any number of different shapes such as rectangles ovals loops or strips. In the embodiment shown in the footprint top substrate layer is larger than the footprint of bottom substrate layer with the extension of top substrate layer forming borders . Thus borders are made of the same polyurethane material that top layer is made of. Borders are thinner than an adjacent portion of each wing since they includes only top layer . The thinner highly compliant rim will likely enhance adherence of physiologic monitoring device to a patient as it provides a transition from an adjacent slightly thicker portion of wings to the patient s skin and thus helps prevent the edge of device from peeling up off the skin. Border may also help prevent the collection of dirt and other debris under flexible body which may help promote adherence to the skin and also enhance the aesthetics of device . In alternative embodiments the footprint of substrate layers may be the same thus eliminating borders .

While the illustrated embodiments of include only two wings which extend from rigid housing in approximately opposite directions for example at a 180 degree angle relative to each other other configurations are possible in alternative embodiments. For example in some embodiments wings may be arranged in an asymmetrical orientation relative to one another and or one or more additional wings may be included. As long as sufficient electrode spacing is provided to permit physiological signal monitoring and as long as wings are configured to provide extended attachment to the skin any suitable configuration and number of wings and electrode traces may be used. The embodiments described above have proven to be advantageous for adherence patient comfort and accuracy of collected heart rhythm data but in alternative embodiments it may be possible to implement alternative configurations.

Adhesive layer is an adhesive that is applied to two portions of the bottom surface of bottom substrate layer each portion corresponding to one of wings . Adhesive layer thus does not extend along the portion of bottom substrate layer upon which rigid housing is mounted. Adhesive layer may be made of any suitable adhesive although certain adhesives have been found to be advantageous for providing long term adhesion to patient skin with relative comfort and lack of skin irritation. For example in one embodiment adhesive layer is a hydrocolloid adhesive. In another embodiment the adhesive layer is comprised of a hydrocolloid adhesive that contains naturally derived or synthetic absorbent materials which take up moisture from the skin during perspiration.

With reference now to each of the two portions of adhesive layer includes a hole into which one of electrodes fits. Electrodes are made of flexible material to further provide for overall conformability of flexible body . In one embodiment for example flexible electrodes may be made of a hydrogel . Electrodes generally provide conformal non irritating contact with the skin to provide enhanced electrical connection with the skin and reduce motion artifact. In some embodiments hydrogel electrodes may be punched into adhesive layer thus forming the holes and filling them with hydrogel electrodes . In one alternative embodiment electrodes and adhesive may be replaced with an adhesive layer made of a conductive material such that the entire adhesive layer on the underside of each wing acts as an electrode. Such an adhesive layer may include a hybrid adhesive conductive substance or adhesive substance mixed with conductive elements or particles. For example in one embodiment such an adhesive layer may be a hybrid of a hydrogel and a hydrocolloid adhesive. Rigid housing of also protects the electronics and power source contained in housing enhances the ability of a patient to provide an input related to a perceived cardiac event and allows for simple manufacturing and reusability of at least some of the contents of housing . These and other features of physiological monitoring device are described in greater detail below.

As discussed above in some embodiments adhesive layer may cover a portion of the underside of lower substrate layer such that at least a portion of the bottom side of flexible body does not include adhesive layer . As seen in hinges may be formed in the flexible body as portions of each wing on which adhesive layer is not applied. Hinge portions are generally located at or near the junction of flexible body with rigid housing and thus provide for flexing of device to accommodate patient movement. In some embodiments hinge portions may have a width that is less than that of adjacent portions of wings thus giving device its peanut shape mentioned above. As shown in as a subject moves device flexes along with patient movement. Device flexion may be severe and is likely to occur many times during long term monitoring. Hinge portions may allow for dynamic conformability to the subject while the rigidity of rigid housing may allow housing to pop up off the patient s skin during device flexion thus preventing peeling of the device off of the skin at its edge.

Flexible body further includes two electrode traces sandwiched between upper substrate layer and lower substrate layer . Each electrode trace may include an electrode interface portion and an electrocardiogram circuit interface portion . As illustrated in the embodiments of ECG circuit interface portions are in physical contact with spring fingers and provide electrical communication with PCBA when device or zoomed in device portion is assembled. Electrode interface portions contact hydrogel electrodes . Thus electrode traces transmit cardiac rhythm signals and or other physiological data in various embodiments from electrodes to PCBA .

The material and thickness of electrode traces are important for providing a desired combination of flexibility durability and signal transmission. For example in one embodiment electrode traces may include a combination of silver Ag and silver chloride AgCl . The silver and silver chloride may be disposed in layers. For example one embodiment of electrode traces may include a top layer of silver a middle layer of carbon impregnated vinyl and a bottom patient facing layer of silver chloride. In another embodiment both top and bottom layers of electrode traces may be made of silver chloride. In one embodiment the top and bottom layers may be applied to the middle layer in the form of silver ink and silver chloride ink respectively. In an alternative embodiment each electrode trace may include only two layers such as a top layer of silver and a bottom layer of silver chloride. In various embodiments the material of a bottom layer of each electrode trace such as AgCl may be selected to match the chemistry of the hydrogel electrodes and create a half cell with the body of the subject.

The thickness of the electrode traces may be selected to optimize any of a number of desirable properties. For example in some embodiments at least one of the layers of electrode traces can be of a sufficient thickness to minimize or slow depletion of the material from an anode cathode effect over time. Additionally the thickness may be selected for a desired flexibility durability and or signal transmission quality.

As mentioned above in some embodiments top gasket and bottom gasket may be attached upper substrate and lower substrate of flexible body . Gaskets may be made of any suitable material such as urethane which provides a water tight seal between the upper housing member and lower housing member of rigid housing . In one embodiment top gasket and or bottom gasket may include an adhesive surface. depicts yet another embodiment where top gasket includes tabs that protrude away from the profile of top housing while still being adhered to upper substrate . The tabs cover a portion of electrode traces and provide a strain relief for the traces at the point of highest stress where the flexible body meets the rigid housing.

With reference now to the embodiment of upper housing member and lower housing member of rigid housing are shown in greater detail. Upper and lower housing members may be configured when coupled together with gaskets in between to form a watertight enclosure for containing PCBA battery holder batteries and any other components contained within rigid housing . Housing members may be made of any suitable material to protect internal components such as water resistant plastic. In one embodiment upper housing member may include a rigid sidewall a light pipe to transmit visual information from the LEDs on the PCBA through the housing member a slightly flexible top surface and an inner trigger member extending inward from top surface . Top surface is configured to be depressed by a patient when the patient perceives what he or she believes to be an arrhythmia or other cardiac event. When depressed top surface depresses inner trigger member which contacts and activates trigger input of PCBA . Additionally as discussed previously top surface may have a concave shape concavity facing the inside of housing to accommodate the shape of a finger. It is believed that the design of upper housing member isolates activation of the trigger input from electrodes thereby minimizing artifact in the data recording.

With continued reference to lower housing member may be configured to detachably connect with upper housing member in such a way that housing members may be easily attached and detached for reusability of at least some of the component parts of monitoring device . In some embodiments a bottom surface patient facing surface of lower housing member may include multiple dimples or bumps protrusions or the like which will contact the patient s skin during use. Dimples may allow for air flow between bottom surface and the patient s skin thus preventing a seal from forming between bottom surface and the skin. It is believed that dimples improve comfort and help prevent a perception in currently available devices in which the patient feels as if monitoring device is falling off when it housing lifts off the skin and breaks a seal with the skin. In yet another embodiment the bottom surface of lower housing member may include multiple divots recesses instead of protrusions to prevent a seal from forming.

Referring now to the embodiment of battery holder is shown in greater detail. Battery holder may be made of plastic or other suitable material is configured to be mounted to PCBA and subsequently attached to rigid housing and is capable of holding two batteries . In alternative embodiments battery holder may be configured to hold one battery or more than two batteries. A plurality of protrusions provide a stable platform for batteries to be positioned a fixed distance above the surface of PCBA avoiding unwanted contact with sensitive electronic components yet providing for adequate compression of spring contacts . Protrusions lock batteries into position and resist the upward force on the batteries from spring contacts . Battery holder also positions batteries appropriately to provide for adequate compression of spring contacts . Use of battery holder in conjunction with spring contacts and allows for batteries to be electrically connected to PCBA while still having additional electronic components between batteries and PCBA and maintain a very compact assembly. Battery holder may include a flexible hook which engages a corresponding rigid hook of upper housing member . Under normal assembly conditions the flexible hook remains securely mated with rigid hook . For disassembly flexible hook can be pushed and bent using an appropriate tool passed through top housing causing it to disengage from rigid hook and subsequently allow top housing to be removed.

With reference now to the embodiments of physiological monitoring device is shown in side view cross section. As shown in A physiological monitoring device may include flexible body coupled with rigid housing . Flexible body may include top substrate layer bottom substrate layer adhesive layer and electrodes . Electrode traces are also typically part of flexible body and are embedded between top substrate layer and bottom substrate layer but they are not shown in . Flexible body forms two wings extending to either side of housing and a border surrounding at least part of each wing . Rigid housing may include an upper housing member coupled with a lower housing member such that it sandwiches a portion of flexible body in between and provides a watertight sealed compartment for PCBA . Upper housing member may include inner trigger member and PCBA may include patient trigger member . As discussed previously lower housing member may include multiple dimples or divots to enhance the comfort of the monitoring device .

It is desirable that PCBA is sufficiently rigid to prevent bending and introducing unwanted artifact into the signal. In certain embodiments an additional mechanism to reduce and prevent unwanted bending of PCBA may be used. This mechanism is shown in . Support post is integral to lower housing and is positioned directly under patient trigger input . During patient symptom triggering upper housing member is depressed engaging inner trigger mechanism and transmitting a force through patient trigger input into PCBA . The force is further transmitted through PCBA and into support post without creating a bending moment thus avoiding unwanted artifact.

Referring to in some embodiments physiological monitoring device may include one or more additional optional features. For example in one embodiment monitoring device may include a removable liner a top label a device identifier and a bottom label . Liner may be applied over a top surface of flexible member to aid in the application of device to the subject. As is described in further detail below liner may help support borders of flexible body as well as wings during removal of one or more adhesive covers not shown that cover adhesive surface before use. Liner may be relative rigid and or firm to help support flexible body during removal of adhesive covers. In various embodiments for example liner may be made of cardboard thick paper plastic or the like. Liner typically includes an adhesive on one side for adhering to the top surface of wings of flexible body .

Labels may be any suitable labels and may include produce name s manufacturer name s logo s design s and or the like. They may be removable or permanently attached upper housing member and or lower housing member although typically they will be permanently attached to avoid unregulated reuse and or resale of the device by an unregistered user. Device identifier may be a barcode sticker computer readable chip RFID or the like. Device identifier may be permanently or removably attached to PCBA flexible body or the like. In some embodiments it may be beneficial to have device identifier stay with PCBA .

Referring now to the embodiments of physiological monitoring device generally includes hinge portions at or near the juncture of each wing with rigid housing . Additionally each wing is typically adhered to the patient via adhesive layers while rigid body is not adhered to the patient and is thus free to float for example move up and down over the patient s skin during movement and change of patient position. In other words when the patient s chest contracts rigid housing pops up or floats over the skin thus minimizing stress on device enhancing comfort and reducing the tendency of wings to peel off of the skin. The advantage provided by the combination of the floating rigid body and the adhered wings is illustrated in . In a patient is sleeping and in a patient is playing golf. In both examples monitoring device is squeezed together by the patient s body causing rigid housing to float above the skin as wings move closer together. This advantage of a floating non attached portion of a physiological monitoring device is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8 560 046 which was previously incorporated by reference.

Referring now to one embodiment of a method for applying physiological monitoring device to the skin of a human subject is described. In this embodiment before the first step shown in the patient s skin may be prepared typically by shaving a small portion of the skin on the left chest where device will be placed and then abrading and or cleaning the shaved portion. As shown in once the patient s skin is prepared a first step of applying device may include removing one or both of two adhesive covers from adhesive layers on the bottom surface of device thus exposing adhesive layers . As illustrated in the next step may be to apply device to the skin such that adhesive layer adheres to the skin in a desired location. In some embodiments one adhesive cover may be removed the uncovered adhesive layer may be applied to the skin and then the second adhesive cover may be removed and the second adhesive layer may be applied to the skin. Alternatively both adhesive covers may be removed before applying device to the skin. While adhesive covers are being removed liner acts as a support for flexible body provides the physician or other user with something to hold onto and prevents flexible body and borders of flexible body from folding in on themselves forming wrinkles and so forth. As described above liner may be made of a relatively stiff firm material to provide support for flexible body during application of device to the skin. Referring to after device has been applied to the skin pressure may be applied to flexible body to press it down onto the chest to help ensure adherence of device to the skin.

In a next step referring to liner is removed from for example peeled off of the top surface of flexible body . As shown in once liner is removed pressure may again be applied to flexible body to help ensure it is adhered to the skin. Finally as shown in upper housing member may be pressed to turn on physiological monitoring device . This described method is only one embodiment. In alternative embodiments one or more steps may be skipped and or one or more additional steps may be added.

In certain embodiments when a desired monitoring period has ended such as about 14 to 21 days in some cases a patient or physician nurse or the like may remove physiological monitoring device from the patient s skin place device in a prepaid mailing pouch and mail device to a data processing facility. At this facility device may be partially or completely disassembled PCBA may be removed and stored physiological data such as continuous heart rhythm information may be downloaded from device . The data may then be analyzed by any suitable method and then provided to a physician in the form of a report. The physician may then discuss the report with the patient. PCBA and or other portions of device such as rigid housing may be reused in the manufacture of subsequent devices for the same or other patients. Because device is built up as a combination of several removably coupled parts various parts may be reused for the same embodiment or different embodiments of device . For example PCBA may be used first in an adult cardiac rhythm monitor and then may be used a second time to construct a monitor for sleep apnea. The same PCBA may additionally or alternatively be used with a differently sized flexible body to construct a pediatric cardiac monitor. Thus at least some of the component parts of device may be interchangeable and reusable.

In further embodiments described in greater detail below the monitoring data may be transmitted wirelessly or through other communication mediums to be analyzed rather than requiring physical shipment of the device for analysis and reporting.

Advantageously physiological monitoring device may provide long term adhesion to the skin. The combination of the configuration of flexible and conformal body the watertight low profile configuration of rigid housing and the interface between the two allows device to compensate for stress caused as the skin of the subject stretches and bends. As a result device may be worn continuously without removal on a patient for as many as 14 to 21 days or more. In some cases device may be worn for greater or less time but 14 to 21 days may often be a desirable amount of time for collecting heart rhythm data and or other physiological signal data from a patient.

In various alternative embodiments the shape of a particular physiological monitoring device may vary. The shape footprint perimeter or boundary of the device may be circular an oval triangular a compound curve or the like for example. In some embodiments the compound curve may include one or more concave curves and one or more convex curves. The convex shapes may be separated by a concave portion. The concave portion may be between the convex portion on the rigid housing and the convex portion on the electrodes. In some embodiments the concave portion may correspond at least partially with a hinge hinge region or area of reduced thickness between the body and a wing.

While described in the context of a heart monitor the device improvements described herein are not so limited. The improvements described in this application may be applied to any of a wide variety of physiological data monitoring recording and or transmitting devices. The improved adhesion design features may also be applied to devices useful in the electronically controlled and or time released delivery of pharmacological agents or blood testing such as glucose monitors or other blood testing devices. As such the description characteristics and functionality of the components described herein may be modified as needed to include the specific components of a particular application such as electronics antenna power supplies or charging connections data ports or connections for down loading or off loading information from the device adding or offloading fluids from the device monitoring or sensing elements such as electrodes probes or sensors or any other component or components needed in the device specific function. In addition or alternatively devices described herein may be used to detect record or transmit signals or information related to signals generated by a body including but not limited to one or more of ECG EEG and or EMG. In certain embodiments additional data channels can be include to collect additional data for example device motion device flex or bed heart rate and or ambient electrical or acoustic noise.

The physiological monitors described above and elsewhere in the specification may further be combined with methods and systems of data processing and transmission that improve the collection of data from the monitor. Further the methods and systems described below may improve the performance of the monitors by enabling timely transmission of clinical information while maintaining the high patient compliance and ease of use of the monitor described above. For example the methods and systems of data processing and transmission described herein this section of elsewhere in the specification may serve to extend the battery life of the monitor improve the accuracy of the monitor and or provide other improvements and advantages as described herein this section or elsewhere in the specification.

The systems and methods described in detail below in reference to the embodiments of may selectively extract transmit and analyze electrocardiographic signal data and other physiological data from a wearable physiological monitor such as is described above in relation to . The systems and methods described below can improve the performance of a wearable physiological monitor that simultaneously records and transmits data through multiple means. For example selective transmission of extracted data allows for decreased power consumption because the wearable patch is not required to transmit all recorded data. By sending extracted data much of the analysis may be performed away from the wearable device without requiring full on board rhythm analysis which can also be highly power consumptive reducing battery life. Further remote analysis without the power constraints inherent to a wearable device may allow for greater sensitivity and accuracy in analysis of the data. Decreased power consumption serves to improve patient compliance because it prolongs the time period between or even eliminates the need for device replacement battery changes or battery recharging during the monitoring cycle. By decreasing battery consumption longer monitoring times may be enabled without device replacement for example at least one week at least two weeks at least three weeks or more than three weeks.

The R R interval time series data may be extracted from or received from a dedicated heart rate monitor such as a heart rate chest strap or heart rate watch or a wearable health or fitness device that incorporates heart rate sensing functionality. Alternatively the R R interval time series may be derived from a wearable patch designed to measure an ECG signal for instance by locating the R peaks in the ECG using a QRS detection algorithm . Furthermore the R R interval time series may be estimated from an alternative physiological signal such as that obtained from photoplethysmography PPG . In this scenario the peak to peak interval time series determined from the PPG signal may be used as an accurate estimate of the R R interval time series.

In one aspect a cardiac rhythm inference system is implemented as a cloud service or server based system that exposes an application programming interface API enabling R R interval time series data or other signal data to be transmitted to the system for instance via HTTP and the resulting cardiac rhythm information to be returned to the calling software. The R R interval time series data or other signal data may be transmitted to the cloud service directly from the heart rate monitoring device itself or indirectly via a smartphone tablet or other internet enabled communication device that can receive data from the heart rate monitoring device in either a wireless or wired manner. In addition the R R interval time series data or other signals may be transmitted from a server that stores the data for a number of users.

In some embodiments a cardiac rhythm inference system is provided through a software library that can be incorporated into a standalone application for installation and use on a smartphone tablet or personal computer. The library may provide identical functionality to that of the inference service but with R R interval time series data or other signal data transmitted directly through a functional call as opposed to through a web service API.

In certain embodiments a cardiac rhythm inference system may accept a plurality of R R interval time series measured from devices of a given user in addition to an individual R R interval time series . In this scenario the system computes the frequency and duration of each of the cardiac rhythm types inferred from the collection of time series data. These results may then be used to estimate confidence statistics for each type of cardiac rhythm based on the frequency and duration of occurrence of that rhythm across the various time series. In addition the rhythm confidence statistics may be updated in a sequential manner for each separate call of the inference service. Furthermore in some embodiments the cardiac rhythm information inferred by the system may be provided back to the calling software only in the event that the confidence score for a given rhythm type exceeds a pre determined threshold value.

In particular embodiments a cardiac rhythm inference system may accept additional sources of data generally described as alternate sensor channels in addition to R R interval time series data to enhance the accuracy and or value of the inferred results. One additional source of data includes user activity time series data such as that measured by a 3 axis accelerometer concurrently with the R R interval time series measurements. In addition the system may accept other relevant metadata that may help to improve the accuracy of the rhythm analysis such as user age gender indication for monitoring pre existing medical conditions medication information medical history and the like and also information on the specific day and time range for each time series submitted to the system. Furthermore the measurement device might also provide some measure of beat detection confidence for example for each R Peak or for sequential time periods. This confidence measure would be based on analysis the recorded signal that in typical embodiments would not be recorded due to storage space and battery energy requirements. Finally in the particular case that the R R interval time series data are derived from an ECG signal the system may accept additional signal features computed from the ECG. These features may include a time series of intra beat interval measurements such as the QT or PR interval or QRS duration or a time series of signal statistics such as the mean median standard deviation or sum of the ECG signal sample values within a given time period.

The various aspects described above could be used either individually or in combination to provide an application providing insights into an individual s health stress sleep fitness and or other qualities.

Some embodiments concern a system for selective transmission of electrocardiographic signal data from a wearable medical sensor. Current wearable sensors such as the iRhythm ZioPatch and further described above in relation to are capable of recording a single lead electrocardiogram ECG signal for up to two weeks on a single battery charge. In many situations however it is desirable for the sensor to be able to transmit in real time or near real time specific sections of the recorded ECG signal with clinical relevance to a computer device such as either a smartphone or an internet connected gateway device for subsequent processing and analysis. In this way the patient or their physician can be provided with potentially valuable diagnostic ECG information during the period that the patient wears the sensor.

As described above a significant challenge with this approach is to manage the battery life of the wearable sensor without requiring replacement or recharging both of which reduce user compliance. Each transmission of an ECG from the sensor to a smartphone or local gateway device using for example Bluetooth Low Energy results in a subsequent reduction in the total charge stored in the sensor battery. Some embodiments of the present disclosure particularly those of address this issue through the use of a novel hardware and software combination to enable the selective transmission of clinically relevant sections of ECG from a wearable sensor.

In certain embodiments the wearable sensor incorporates either a software hardware or hybrid QRS detector that produces a real time estimate of each R peak location in the ECG. The R peak location data is then used to compute an R R interval time series that is subsequently transmitted to a smartphone or gateway device according to a predefined schedule for example once per hour . In addition a time stamp is also transmitted which stores the onset time for the R R interval time series relative to the start of the ECG recording. Since the R R interval time series for a given section of ECG is significantly smaller in terms of bytes occupied than the ECG signal itself it can be transmitted with considerably less impact on battery life.

In some embodiments of a second stage of the system the R R interval time series together with the onset time stamp is subsequently transmitted by the smartphone or gateway device to a server. On the server the R R interval time series is used to infer a list of the most probable heart rhythms together with their onset and offset times during the period represented by the time series data. The list of inferred heart rhythms is then filtered according to specific criteria such that only rhythms matching the given criteria are retained after filtering. A measure of confidence may also be used to assist in filtering the events in a manner that might improve the Positive Predictivity of detection.

In certain embodiments of a third stage of the system for each rhythm in the filtered rhythm set the server transmits to the smartphone or gateway device the onset and offset time for that specific rhythm. In the event that the inferred rhythm duration exceeds a pre defined maximum duration the onset and offset times may be adjusted such that the resulting duration is less than the maximum permissible duration. The onset and offset times received by the gateway are then subsequently transmitted to the wearable sensor which in turn transmits the section of the recorded ECG signal between the onset and offset times back to the gateway. This section of ECG is then transmitted to the server where it can be analyzed and used to provide diagnostic information to the patient or their physician.

In some embodiments the system fundamentally allows a device worn for up to about 14 21 or 30 days or beyond without battery recharging or replacement both activities that reduce patient compliance and therefore diagnostic value to provide timely communication of asymptomatic arrhythmia events. This development is motivated by technology constraints in order to enable a small wearable device that does not require battery change or recharging while providing continuous arrhythmia analysis with high accuracy it is desirable to limit the complexity of analysis performed on board. Similarly streaming of all of the recorded ECG data to an off board analysis algorithm may not be practical without imposing greater power requirements. This motivates a more creative triage approach where selected features of the recorded ECG signal including but not limited to R R intervals are sent for every beat allowing a customized algorithm to locate a number for example 10 of 90 second events to request from the device in full resolution to support comprehensive analysis for example a resolution capable of supporting clinical diagnosis.

In other embodiments the system would provide the ability to detect asymptomatic arrhythmias in a timely manner on a wearable adhesively affixed device that does not require frequent recharging or replacement. This would be used to enhance the value of some current clinical offerings which only provide clinical insight after the recording is completed and returned for analysis.

In certain embodiments the system would allow actionable clinical insight to be derived from data collected on low cost easy to use consumer wearable devices that are otherwise only focused on fitness and wellness. For example the technology could be used to create a very effective low cost screening tool capable of detecting the presence of Atrial Fibrillation in the at large population. By using such a tool not only would patients in need of care be found more easily but it may be done earlier and more cost effectively which lead to better outcomes namely through reducing stroke risk by identifying AF more quickly.

In particular embodiments the system may provide the service through a downloadable application that after receiving customer consent for data access and payment approval would initiate access and analysis of heart beat data stored from wearable devices either stored locally in a mobile device or in an online repository. This data pull and analysis would happen through an Algorithm API and would result in a clinical finding being sent back to the application to be provided to the user. If the data was sufficient to support a screening oriented finding for example Likely presence of an irregular rhythm was detected the application would direct them to a cardiologist where a more diagnostically focused offering for example the ZIO Service could be provided to support clinical diagnosis and treatment. In further embodiments as also described elsewhere in the specification the system may trigger an alarm if a particular measurement and or analysis indicates that an alarm is needed.

Further examples of additional scenarios of clinical value may include coupling ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring with a blood alcohol monitor to study the interaction of AF and lifestyle factors. For example ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring could be coupled with a blood glucose monitor to study the impact of Hypoglycemia on arrhythmias. Alternatively ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring could be coupled with a respiratory rate and or volume monitor to study the interaction of sleep apnea and breathing disorders. Further there could be evaluation of the high rates of supraventricular ectopic beats as a potential precursor for AF for example 720 SVEs in 24 hour period .

A wide variety of different types of ECG or comparable biological signal features may be extracted. For example R peak locations may be extracted. In certain embodiments the R peak locations are extracted via various methods such as a Pan Tompkins algorithm Pan and Tompkins 1985 providing a real time QRS complex detection algorithm employing a series of digital filtering steps and adaptive thresholding or an analog R peak detection circuit comprising an R peak detector consisting of a bandpass filter a comparator circuit and dynamic gain adjustment to locate R peaks. The RR intervals may be calculated from peak locations and used as the primary feature for rhythm discrimination. In embodiments an R peak overflow flag may be extracted. If more than a certain number of R peaks were detected during a given time window such that not all data can be transmitted a flag may be raised by the firmware. Such an extraction may be used to eliminate noisy segments from analysis on the basis that extremely short intervals of R R are not physiologically possible. With similar motivation an R peak underflow flag may be extracted to indicate an unrealistically long interval between successive R peaks provided appropriate considerations for asystole are made in this evaluation. In an alternative implementation with the same goal the lack of presence of R peaks in a prolonged interval could be associated with a confidence measure which would describe the likelihood that the interval was clinical or artifact.

Another example of a feature that may be extracted includes a saturation flag a firmware or hardware determined indication that the signal saturated during a given time window for example 1 second . Such an extraction may be used to eliminate noisy segments from analysis. In certain embodiments P T wave locations may be extracted. This is similar to R peak detection but tuned to lower frequency waves. R peak locations may be used to determine the areas of possible wave components. Still another example of a feature that may be extracted includes the breathing rate. ECG derived respiration EDR may be derived from studying the amplitude modulation of ECG signal amplitude. EDR may be associated with other clinical indicators of arrhythmia. In embodiments R peak amplitude may be extracted by measuring the ECG signal amplitude at R peak locations. This pattern may be studied to discriminate between true and false peak detection and or to detect changes in beat morphology.

In particular embodiments the ECG signal amplitude proxy may be extracted. This feature may include the range of the raw signal data during a given time period the maximum value of the signal during a given time period or the minimum value of the signal during a given time period. This feature may be used as a data point for noise detection or possible changes in morphology of the ECG for example ventricular ectopy . In some embodiments additional ECG signal samples may be extracted. Sampling a few data points at regular intervals or consecutively from a region in between selected R peaks will allow for determination of the confidence of rhythm and or noise classification. Such a selection may be based on R R interval length. For instance if the interval is longer than 3 seconds it may be an indicator of a pause. Local ECG signal energy may also be extracted for example by taking the sum square of signal values within a window centered on a point of interest for example an R peak thereby providing an integral of ECG sample values in a given time window. This information may be used to characterize the morphology of beats supraventricular tachycardia SVT vs. ventricular tachycardia VT .

In certain embodiments spectral information may be extracted via extracting statistics from the output from one or more filters either realized on hardware during signal acquisition or firmware. Filters may be implemented as a filter bank such as a short time Fourier transform STFT or wavelet transform. Such information may be used to characterize the morphology of heart beats. Output from simple machine learned models may be extracted. For example the likelihood of a selected ECG signal segment under a probability model for example Gaussian given raw collected data values or any combination of features derived from available channels of data may be extracted. The use of a simple machine learned model may allow transmission of less data. In embodiments the output can directly or indirectly give insight into the type of underlying rhythm the presence of ECG features such as a P wave the confidence level of R peak detection and the presence of noise.

Once the feature extraction as described above is completed various features may then be transmitted to a processing device server . The features and alternate sensor channel data and or features as described below are transmitted at regular intervals to a processor that is not a physical part of the sensor . The interval definition may be pre set or configurable with each use or dynamically configurable. Transmission of features may also be bundled and sent when another reason for communication exists such as transmission of symptomatic data described in greater detail below in relation to . In certain embodiments the processing device may be a cloud based server a physical server at a company location a physical server at patient or clinic location a smartphone tablet personal computer smartwatch automobile console audio device and or an alternate device on or off site. In particular embodiments the transmission may utilize short range RF communication protocols such as Bluetooth ZigBee WiFi 802.11 Wireless USB ANT or ANT Ultrawideband UWB and or custom protocols. The transmission may be via infrared communication such as IrDA and or inductive coupling communication such as NFC. In certain embodiments transmission may be accomplished via cellular data networks and or wired communication protocols such as USB Serial TDMA or other suitable custom means.

In some embodiments the transmitted features are processed by the remote processor utilizing the data features to perform analysis via a rhythm inference system that analyzes and identifies segments locations likely to include arrhythmia. For example arrhythmia and ectopy types that may be identified could include Pause 2or 3degree AVB Complete Heart Block SVT AF VT VF Bigeminy Trigeminy and or Ectopy. Confidence of determination may be included in the identification of rhythms. Further the rhythm inference system may also utilize patient demographic data such as age gender or indication to improve accuracy and or refine confidence in determinations.

The identified arrhythmia locations are then transmitted back to the sensor . The transmission back to the sensor may be accomplished by any communication protocols technology described herein this section or elsewhere in the specification for example via Bluetooth. The sensor then reads the transmitted identified locations and accesses the areas of memory corresponding to the transmitted identified locations of the ECG. In some embodiments the sensor applies additional analysis of the identified segments to further build confidence in the arrhythmia identification. This further rhythm confidence determination step allows for increasing positive predictivity prior to the power hungry transmission step. In embodiments if the confidence exceeds a defined threshold the data segment is transmitted. For example the defined threshold may be a preset value or it may be set per user and monitoring session. In embodiments the defined threshold may be changed dynamically depending on the nature of the rhythm the history of accurate detection within the monitoring period and or the confidence of the rhythm inference system. Additional analysis may also be performed. Examples of possible analysis techniques include any methods disclosed herein this section or elsewhere in the specification for example R peak amplitude ECG signal amplitude proxy ECG signal samples local ECG signal energy spectral information and or output from a simple machine learned model.

If the confidence exceeds a threshold as described above the sensor may transmit the requested ECG segments to the processing device via any transmission means described herein this section or elsewhere in the specification. The processing device may complete further analysis on the segments to confirm accuracy of predicted arrhythmia before using data to report to a user and or physician as needed.

In some embodiments an alternative data channel may be provided by a pulse oximeter. For example a photoplethysmogram PPG may be generated by the pulse oximeter. The PPG may provide an alternative source for R peak locations or as a cross check on R peak detection by the ECG circuitry. Further the PPG data channel may be combined with multiple PPG BioZ channels to output confidence of R peak detection confidence levels. In further embodiments SpO2 perfusion via the pulse oximeter may provide further clinical indications of a severe arrhythmia. In certain embodiments an alternative sensor channel may involve bioimpedance which may be used to determine heart beat location and or act as an alternative source for R peak data. In some embodiments temperature data may be provided via an alternative sensor channel. This data can be used in conjunction with other metrics of activity to discern activity type level and or sleep. In some embodiments the alternative data channel may provide information from a clock for example the time of day or an indication of daytime or nighttime. In certain embodiments the alternative data channel may be provided by a microphone stethoscope providing an audible recording of heart beat. Lastly an alternative data channel may be provided by a flex or bend sensor which may allow for identification of motion artifacts.

The consumer device system without full ECG sensing advantageously enables arrhythmia analysis using consumer available heart rate sensors thereby reducing the cost and increasing the availability of the device. Consequently this may enable arrhythmia screening on a larger population including via over the counter screening.

The location for data strip analysis may vary. For example analysis may occur local to the patient on a smartphone tablet or PC. Alternatively analysis may occur local to the clinic on a server or other processing device or analysis may occur local to the ECG analysis service provider on a server or other processing device. Lastly in embodiments the analysis may occur using cloud based distributed processing resources. In certain embodiments a report may be provided for each symptomatic ECG data strip however a report may not be provided if the symptomatic ECG data strip is not determined to be clinically interesting. In some cases the report may be made available but notification to the user may be limited to those cases of particular clinical relevance. Offering this option can limit the demands on a user s time.

In certain embodiments the report may be delivered in a variety of ways. For example the report may be delivered through a website through a smartphone tablet or PC application through an Electronic Health Record EMR EHR system with interoperability and integration into multiple providers systems or through automatic messaging such as email SMS app based messaging. The recipient of the report may vary in some applications the report recipient may be the patient user while in other applications the report recipient may be a clinician.

In particular embodiments when monitoring is complete the patient removes the device and sends the complete continuous ECG record to a data processing location. The method of sending may vary for example it may be sent via physical transfer of the entire device such as mail or bringing the device to the prescribing clinic or it may be sent send via local download of data and subsequent download to a data processing location. In some cases the patient may not wait to remove the device before sending a partial segment of the continuous ECG record this would be enabled by transfer methods that do not require removal of the device for example NFC or ultra low power wireless data transfer. As with symptomatic ECG analysis described above the data processing location may vary.
