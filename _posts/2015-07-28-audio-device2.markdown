The power supply unit may be used as a drive power source of the microphone of the earphones via the microphone terminal and the ANC power source unit may be used as a drive power source of the ANC block via the ANC terminals .

The controller may also be implemented by a processor such as an application processor AP which may be included in the electronic device . For instance the controller may also be implemented by the processor of the electronic device illustrated in .

The controller may input the voltage of the microphone terminal . In cases where the AP is used as the controller the controller may input the voltage of the microphone terminal via an analog to digital converter ADC . Therefore the controller may recognize the voltage which is input via an ADC port and converted into a digital value.

The controller may control a power source device of the power supply unit to apply electric power to the microphone terminal .

The power supply unit may include the power source device a switch and resistors . The power supply unit is operated by the controller to generate electric power. The power source device may be a power converter such as low dropout which generates electric power from a battery of the electronic device . The switch and the resistors may be connected between the output end of the power source device and the microphone terminal . The switch may be controlled by the controller to apply the output power of the power source device to the microphone terminal via one of the resistors . Power is applied from the power source device via the switch and the resistor to the microphone terminal and is applied from the power source device via the switch and the resistor to the microphone terminal .

The resistor may have a higher resistance value than the resistor . The resistor may have a resistance value corresponding to the consumption current of the microphone .

The volume down switch may be used as a volume down key for indicating a decrease in volume to the electronic device . The send end switch may be used as a send end key for indicating a beginning and an end of a call.

The resistors may have different resistance values.

Among elements of an audio device and an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure connectors will be hereinafter described as follows.

Referring to the audio device includes the audio side connector the ANC block the ANC power source unit and the on off switch unit .

The audio side connector may include the microphone terminal for outputting a microphone signal to the electronic device the L channel audio terminal and the R channel audio terminal for receiving an audio signal from the electronic device and the ANC terminal and the ground terminal for applying power input from the electronic device to the ANC block .

Referring to mentioned above the connectors of the electronic device and the audio device may be configured with a 5 pole connector that includes the L channel audio terminals the R channel audio terminals the ANC terminals the ground terminals and the microphone terminals .

The ANC block may be provided in the audio device such that the ANC block is driven by power input from the electronic device to remove noise around the audio device .

The ANC power source unit may be provided in the electronic device to apply the power to the ANC block via the ANC terminals as drive power.

The ANC terminal may be included in one of the area of the microphone terminal the area of the L channel audio terminal the area of the R channel audio terminal and the area of the ground terminal .

Namely in cases where the ANC terminal is included in the area of the R channel audio terminal a non contact area may be provided between the ANC terminal and the R channel audio terminal to partition the ANC terminal and the R channel audio terminal .

Referring to the audio side connector may be configured with a 5 pole terminal while maintaining an existing jack shape based on the 3.5 mm standard as it is. In other words the ANC terminal of the audio side connector may be included in the area of the existing R channel audio terminal without a change in the size of the audio side connector .

Likewise the electronic device side connector may be configured in a socket shape of a 5 pole terminal to correspond to the audio side connector configured with the 5 pole terminal. The ANC terminal of the electronic device side connector may be electrically connected to the ANC terminal of the audio side connector without a change in the size of the electronic device side connector due to the use of the existing ground terminal included in the electronic device side connector . In addition specific dimensions of the size of the audio side connector are disclosed as illustrated in .

Since the ANC terminal is configured by including the non contact area in the area of the existing R channel audio terminal it is possible to supply the power of the electronic device to the ANC block of the audio device via the ANC terminal while maintaining the shape of the existing connector of the audio device. Therefore since an existing battery not illustrated included in the audio device is not required compactness and slimness of the audio device can be achieved and since additional maintenance of the battery is also not necessary costs for the audio device can be reduced.

Further the electronic device may include the popup prevention circuit device unit which removes popup noise generated when the ANC power source unit supplies electric power to the audio device or cuts off the power supply via the on off switch unit .

Namely when electric power is applied to the ANC block by the on off switch unit or the power is cut off by the on off switch unit a surge pulse may occur due to an unstable bias voltage of an internal circuit. The surge pulse may be amplified by a driving circuit and may generate uncomfortable noise through a speaker etc. The noise is referred to as the popup noise.

In this state operations of the connectors of the audio device and the electronic device will be described in more detail with reference to as follows.

At this time the ANC terminal of the audio side connector and the ANC terminal of the electronic device side connector are electrically connected to each other.

As illustrated in effective contact distances of the ANC terminal and the R channel audio terminal of the audio side connector may be 0.6 mm.

When a user presses an ANC drive key not illustrated included in the electronic device in this state to drive the ANC block the on off switch unit is turned on and applies the power of the ANC power source unit included in the electronic device to the ANC terminal of the electronic device side connector and the ANC terminal applies the power to the ANC block included in the audio device via the ANC terminal of the audio side connector to drive the ANC block .

At this time the user can listen to high quality calls and music in such a noise situation at the same time that surrounding noise is removed through the driving of the ANC block .

In this state in cases where the user does not use the ANC block if the user presses the ANC drive key not illustrated included in the electronic device again the on off switch unit is turned off and the power of the ANC power source unit included in the electronic device is cut off. At the same time the ANC block is not supplied with power. Accordingly the ANC block does not operate.
