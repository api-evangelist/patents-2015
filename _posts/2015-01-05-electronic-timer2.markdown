title: Electronic timer
abstract: An electronic interval timer in a dodecahedron case is described. The timer is set by turning uppermost one of 11 faces; and reset by turning uppermost the 12face. In one embodiment, the timer is free of buttons, knobs, springs, time displays, electronic visual indicators and openings in the case. Time interval completion is announced via audible tones or speech. An aggregate time interval may be set equal to the sum of legends on more than one face. The timer detects carrying such that a running time interval is not modified. The timer may be programmed via a sequence of uppermost sides. Modes may be selected via shaking or tapping. Time remaining may be announced, an interval cleared, or an interval restarted responsive to detected motion. Other polyhedral shapes may be used. Claims include a method of setting a time interval; and specific ordering of face legends.

The field of this invention is timers. More specifically the field is convenience timers sometimes referred to as kitchen timers. They may also be used to time play classes work or other activities.

Later mechanical timers typically comprised a spring a governor or balance wheel a knob for winding the spring a pointer and a dial with markings. The user would turn the knob to both set a desired time and to wind the spring. The timer ran at a hopefully fixed speed calibrated to the dial. When the set time was up the spring would also power a bell announcing the completion of the set interval.

Now electronic timers are prevalent. A common format comprises a keyboard typically with the digits 0 through 9 plus a few function keys such as start pause and reset. These timers usually include a display such as an LCD initially showing the time interval being set and then the time remaining. An audible alarm announcements completion often continuous until the alarm is manually cleared.

Such electronic timers are cheaper and more reliable that the mechanical timers they replaced. However they suffer from many disadvantages. The buttons are usually small hard to see and hard for many people to operate. Similarly the displays are often small and hard to see. Such timers are effectively useless in the dark and hard to use in dim light or for people who are not wearing their glasses. They are very difficult for people to use who have limited use of their fingers or hands or have limited eyesight.

In addition electronic timers are neither fast to set nor intuitive. While a traditional mechanical timer required no more than a twist of the knob electronic timers require a specific sequence of buttons to be pushed. Such multiple actions require accurate sight dexterity and thinking.

In addition electronic timers typically have other disadvantages. For example they use batteries that must be replaced they are not waterproof and they break easily. Although these weaknesses could be overcome by engineering design and money the inherent elements of the current art of electronic timers such as keyboards and displays make such ruggedization challenging and in practice is not done. Multiple button sequences and the need for light are endemic requirements for current electronic timers.

Devices such as smart phones include timers as applications. Although the user interfaces for these are dramatic improvements over electronic timers such as the use of voice commands to set the timer they require an expensive fragile and theft prone platform on which to run. They are not suitable for dedicated use nor appropriate for rugged applications. Such expensive devices are rarely used as kitchen timers because of the dangers in the kitchen of spills and dropping. Voice programmed apps do not respond to all languages nor to all speakers.

Both electronic timers and smart phone timing applications may provide illuminated displays. However the power usage of such displays then requires either frequent battery changes or frequent charging both of which are a serious inconvenience and often result in a non operational timer when needed.

In addition all such timers discussed above rarely permit more than one time interval to be set concurrently. Nor do such timers announce the length of a set time interval at the completion of the interval.

The current invention solves the discussed weakness of the prior art. It may be the easiest to use settable timer ever invented. Only one hand is required for setting. The timer works for users who speak any language unlike voice programmed timers. A basic embodiment consists of a 12 sided polyhedron shape. The faces of the polyhedron are printed or embossed with an interval length legend in large high contrast digits. To set the timer one simply rotates the timer until the desired time interval is face up. No other action is required. There are no buttons knobs or displays.

One face of the timer indicates OFF. This face is placed up to prematurely terminate a set interval or to place the timer into a known state. The legend on the OFF face may be 0. 

In one embodiment a set time interval may be changed or restarted by simply again rotating the timer. In another embodiment rotation to a new face while an interval is running causes a second time interval to be started running concurrently. In yet another embodiment rotation to multiple faces in a sequence creates a time interval equal to the sum of the legends on the multiple faces. These embodiments may be combined using for example the elapsed time between rotations to select the operational mode.

In one exemplary implementation 11 available fixed times are 1 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 30 45 and 60 minutes. Another implementation comprises 1 2 3 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 and 60 minute times on face legends.

The basic operation of the timer in various embodiments is described above in SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.

There are many choices of implementation options as those trained in the art know. There are many choices of operational states and state machines as those trained in the art know.

There are many choices of audio message announcements either tones speech or special audio effects as well as visual and haptic announcements as those trained in the art know.

High contrast large face legends permit the timer to be easily read in dim light or by people with compromised vision. The use of embossed digits or braille permits easy use by people with poor or no vision.

Some embodiments provide a set of audible indications that are responsive to the length of a time interval an operating mode or setting activity. An optional repetitive tick provides confidence a time interval is running.

Some embodiments permit the legends on the faces to be altered by users for example by adhesive stickers. The stickers may provide symbols for particular times such as egg to show a time interval for cooking an egg. A symbol may indicate that a class lesson meeting or session is ending.

In one embodiment a user may create or choose a set of times he or she wishes the timer to support. The legends on the faces may be manually changed to match wirelessly set times. Although this embodiment is programmable to user desired configurations the timer remains overwhelmingly simple and reliable to use.

In another embodiment a user may wirelessly download tones or announcements. In this way time intervals may be announced appropriately for that user such as Your egg is cooked Class is over or Time for bed. 

In one embodiment the timer is waterproof and sanitizable. It may be washed by hand or in the dishwasher or in some embodiments autoclaved. These features allow the timer to be used in medical environments schools and outdoors without fear of either contamination that damages the timer or the transmission of germs. Because there are no buttons knobs or electronic displays the timer is easily sealed and is cleanable without the risk of small crevices harboring bacteria or allowing the entry of water or germs. Prior art with the possible exception of the hourglass does not have these attributes.

In one embodiment there is no access to an internal permanently sealed battery. Because there are no electronic displays ten year battery life is easily achievable.

In one embodiment the timer case may be transparent or translucent or have such portions allowing an interior light to be used to illuminate the legends on the faces locate the timer at night or pulse to show activity or flash to indicate time completion.

The timer may be wirelessly chargeable incorporating an electromagnetic power receiver or an optical power receiver. The optical power receiver may be responsive to infrared IR light permitting all faces to be opaque to visible light.

In addition a transparent or translucent case may permit an internal sealed battery to be charged using solar or light energy.

In some embodiments the timer is exceptionally rugged. A polyhedron shape is easily manufactured at reasonable cost compared to a smart phone and adapted to withstand high stress. With no buttons knobs springs displays or openings the timer may easily be manufactured to withstand substantial abuse such as being dropped repeatedly or very rough play by children or for use in a classroom or prison or for use in health care.

In some embodiments the polyhedron shape may have rounded vertices and edges permitting use by children or otherwise in environments where a traditional timer might cause harm for example if one child threw it at another child or in a prison.

In a simple embodiment the user simply sets a desired time by rotating the timer until the desired time is shown on the upper face. When that time expires the timer provides an alert which may be any combination of one or more audible visual or tactile such as vibratory signals.

In some embodiments the timer may be carried during a running time interval without altering the running time interval.

In some embodiments the timer has a transport mode during which the timer operates at lower power and is silent. This mode may be exited automatically at the cessation of movement. In some embodiment the timer has a dishwasher mode that causes lower power operation and silence operating during transport. This mode may be exited automatically at the cessation of movement. This mode may or may not be the same mode as transport mode.

In some embodiments the timer has a factory mode during which the timer operates at lower power and is silent until this mode is exited by a specific action or set of actions or sequence of actions.

In some embodiments the timer has a retail or demo mode that changes the available time intervals and audio alerts or both to permit demonstration.

In some embodiments the timer has a retail or demo mode that changes the available time intervals and audio alerts or both to permit demonstration.

In some embodiments specific audio announcements are made by the timer when entering or exiting modes.

More complex embodiments include an indication when the timer is set or of the set time or that the time is running or that a running time has been changed or restarted or that the timer has been moved or the timer has been programmed or the timer has an error or the timer battery is low or other functions modes or features or any combination of these. Audible outputs may be sounds musical tones speech in any or variable languages or combinations thereof. Audible outputs may be selected programmed or downloaded by end users or by a manufacturer or distributor in advance of delivery to and end customer.

Various embodiments are ideal for people who are blind or sight impaired. Various embodiments are ideal for people who are deaf or hearing impaired. Various embodiments are ideal for people who have limited finger or hand dexterity.

A set of views of one embodiment is provided in 12 views in . This Figure shows overhead views. Other figures typically show perspective views. Numerous times interval values other than those shown in this exemplary embodiment may be used. These times may be units of minutes or other units of time. Legends need not be Arabic numbers. For example Hebrew numbers or Chinese numbers may be used or times may be spelled out in a language.

In one embodiment the shortest five times are placed in the top hemisphere defined by OFF up with the longest six times placed in the bottom hemisphere. In one embodiment the longest time such as 60 minutes in placed on the face opposite the OFF face. In one embodiment the legend color feel or combination of these attributes of the OFF face are distinct from the other faces in order to facilitate ease of identifying the OFF face. The word OFF may be in any language or may be a symbol such as an international symbol for off or the digit zero.

In this embodiment shown in the five faces surrounding and adjacent to the OFF face read left to right for increasing times as one holds the timer with the OFF face generally up. In this Figure note the shown times are in sequence 1 2 3 5 and 7. Note also that the orientation of the legends for these five faces are such that they read normally with respect to orientation and angle with the OFF face uppermost. These arrangements are valuable in aiding visibility and ease of use including intuitively locating a desired face. This arrangement is most visible looking at the upper left view in .

Note that in this embodiment the longest times are on the lower hemisphere. The bottom of the timer has the longest time here 60. Note that when this face is uppermost that is the timer is turned upside down from the normal OFF position that the five next longest times here 10 15 20 30 45 are arranged such that they read normally with respect to orientation and angle and increase in sequence left to right for 10 15 20 30 and 45. This arrangement is most visible looking at the lower right view in . These arrangements of the six largest times are valuable in aiding visibility and ease of use including intuitively locating a desired face. Such arrangements independent of specific times are claimed explicitly as embodiments of the invention.

There are many alternative time sets. Once such set is 1 2 3 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 and 60. Another such set is 1 2 3 5 10 15 30 45 60 120 180 minutes. Time units may be minutes seconds hours or other units. Such units may or may not be included in legends and may be mixed. For example the legends for 60 120 and 180 minute may be 1 hour 2 hours and 3 hours. Timers used for demonstration may have shorter times. For example times normally in minutes may become times in seconds for sales or demonstration purposes. In some embodiments the set of available times may be mode dependent.

The second action or embodiment that is shown in is changing from a first running time interval to a new time interval. In this example a first time interval of 7 minutes has been set. Later the user decides that the 7 minute time interval should be cancelled and new time interval of 2 minutes should be set. The timer is simply now rotated so that the 2 face is uppermost.

Distinguishing between the first action and the second action may be a matter of embodiment or mode. However using a threshold time such as 5 seconds or in the range of 1 to 15 seconds or 2 to 10 seconds the desired action may be determined. That is for example if the timer is motionless still with the first face uppermost for less than 5 seconds then the first action is used. If the timer is motionless with the first face is uppermost more than 5 seconds then the second action is used. Note that this threshold time may be dynamic learned or predetermined.

It is necessary to detect whether the user desires to restart the current time interval or is merely moving the timer. A threshold angle may be used for example 90 . If the timer is rotated less than the threshold it is being moved without changing the in progress interval. If the timer is rotated more than the threshold the time interval is being restarted. Note that it is not necessary for the timer to be motionless. For such detection is sufficient for the user to rotate it in the user s hand without setting it down. The rotation threshold is measured from the uppermost face or last uppermost face that determined the in progress time interval.

Continuing with an accelerometer IC is used to determine which face is up and may also provide other information such as that the timer is in motion being rotated or is being transported or dropped or shaken or bumped and the like. The accelerometer is also able to wakeup the processor or provide an interrupt on detection of certain selected motion events. An exemplary accelerometer is a Freescale Semiconductor MMA8451Q. The ideal interface to the process is bidirectional as shown by communication lines as this allows the parameters of the accelerometer to be programmed.

Continuing with the heart of the electronics in some embodiments is a processor . Those in the art know there are many different processors processor packages and configurations suitable. An exemplary processor is a Freescale Semiconductor MK64FN1MOVLL12. The processor has internal RAM and program memory such as Flash memory . Such memories may be internal to the processor IC or external or both. The Flash memory is suitable to hold both executable code and data such as sound data for tones or speech output.

Continuing with the timer ideally provides audio output via an amplifier and speaker . More than one amplifier may be used and more than one speaker may be used. The amplifier s are fed by a signal from the processor. Such a signal may an analog value such as from a DAC or a digital signal which may be one bit pulse width modulated or multiple bits. Audio data may be straight audio samples or may be compressed or may be codes that represent sounds phonemes or portions thereof. In some embodiments the audio amplifier or audio control circuit may draw its data directly from memory such as by the use of DMA. An exemplary audio amplifier is MAX9730 PAM8302 or NXP TFA9887. The one or more speakers are typically 4 ohms or 8 ohms however other values and types of speakers may be used including audio transducers such as PZTs.

Continuing with an oscillator provides a time base. The oscillator may be a crystal such as 32 KHz or a resonator or a higher frequency crystal such as 8 MHz or 25 MHz or an integrated oscillator IC. More than one oscillator or crystal may be used. The oscillator s signal may supply other ICs in addition to the processor .

Communication between the processor and peripheral chips may be a common multiplexed bus such as I2C I squared C or I2S I squared S .

Motion filtering. As the operation of the timer comprises rotating the timer until the desired time face is up detecting such setting motion as well as other motions is critical to reliable and intuitive operation of the timer. In addition the timer may be moved for a long period of time not directly related to setting or clearing a time. For example the timer may be running and is being transported from one room to another room. As another example the timer is being washed either by hand or in a dishwasher. As yet another example the timer may be being shipped such as prior to first sale or in a user s car from one location to another. It is important that such actions are identified in order to provide the expected operation of the timer while conserving power. This includes entering one or more low power modes during transport and washing so as to not wear down the battery and also to avoid repeated and undesired audio output from the timer.

In addition the timer may experience small motions from vibrations or being bumped or being handled by a user with no intent by the user to change the current operating mode.

One way to assist in identifying these different types of motion is to define at least three time intervals such as Ts Tm and Tl. These time intervals are used to categorize motion of the timer. Position changes at or less than Ts short times are generally ignored in that they do not change the timer state. Note however that some Ts or shorter actions do have meaning such a timer being dropped or shaken. The time period Tm may be defined as greater than Ts and less than Tl. Timer position changes within this time interval are typically intentional by the user in that they indicate a desired timer state change. Such user desirable stat changes may be called operational state changes. State changes that take Tl or longer typically indicate some activity other than normal use of the timer as stated above such as washing or transport. These time thresholds may change dynamically. In particular the timer may learn these times by recording timer activity.

The raw output of the accelerometer is typically noisy. That is some type of low pass filtering is appropriate. This may be implement within the accelerometer in hardware or software within the processor or effectively by a state machine. For example the position of the timer may be sampled periodically such as 10 times per second. To recognize a motion within the Tm window at least five consecutive time samples must indicate that the same timer side is up. Other values that these examples may be used. Accelerometer sample rates may range from 100 times per second to once every 10 seconds.

When we refer to rotation or movement or an uppermost face we are including suitable and well known filtering of data from the accelerometer to reasonably match a user s perception of moving v. still. 

An exemplary motion table is shown below as Table 2. In some embodiments additional time windows are used to filter timer position or determine state changes. Filters many include one pole low pass filters multi pole low pass filters band pass filters sampling filters delays thresholds other filtering algorithms or combinations.

Operation of the timer from the point of view of an end user as well as for internal operation may be described by the use of timer states which may be called operational states. Those trained in the art know that many different state diagrams may be used to provide the same or similar effects. One such state table is shown below in Table 3 below.

Both the internal logic of the timer and the user s perception of what the timer is doing now may be represented by an operational timer state. Exemplary operational states are listed above in Table 3. Table 4 below shows exemplary operational state changes.

The user may not be aware of all power down states internally in the timer. In some embodiments it is desirable to have more than one power down state. For example when the timer is timing state T no internal activity is necessary until one of events occurs either the timer is moved as the accelerometer may detects motion or an internal timer expires. The timer may use an internal time base to wake up the processor periodically. For example the electronics may wake up once every second to see if the user s set interval has expired. In addition an interrupt from the accelerometer may wake up the processor.

However for some activity such as transport or washing a different low power mode is desired. For this low power mode the timer may not enable accelerometer interrupts.

In some embodiments various operating modes are desirable. For example the timer may generate output messages in English or French or in another language. As a second example there may be more than one model of timer with different values on the faces. As a third example a user may which to change the operating mode. For example there may be verbose mode where the timer provides frequent audio feedback or a quiet mode where only the completion of set times causes audio output. A user may select a male or female voice as yet another example.

In general we may think of two types of programming of such timer modes The first type is mode of operation set by a factory distributor or retailer. The second type of mode of operation is set by an end user.

For either type of mode programming a novel method of programming is to rotate the timer through a particular sequence of up sides within particular time periods. For example rotating the timer from OFF to 7 to 60 to 5 and then back to OFF with each side staying up for a time period between 1 second and 10 seconds for example may be a recognized programming sequence to cause a particular operating mode to be set until changed by another programming sequence.

Such programming has the advantage that a single electronics module may be used for a large number of different timer modules sold into different markets.

Table 5 below provides an exemplary set of audio announcements. These announcements are also called message or phrases. All audio text examples in the Table are single exemplary examples of a specific operational state change.

Operating Modes. Operating modes may be viewed as either global or local. Global modes refer to the overall operation of the timer which rotations cause which states actions and outputs. Local modes may also be called operational states as discussed above. Typically operational state changes are caused by i one or more rotations or the cessation of rotation ii movement or the cessation of movement iii a timer interval being initiated completed or updated or iv an internal time period has passed. Generally the user causes i and ii above while the normal function of the timer causes iii . Cause iv is used for filtering of i and ii and for changing into or out of power down states or modes.

Global modes may be set at a factory or a distributor or a retailer. These modes may be for different time models different feature sets different target markets different languages or to change a timer from a shipping mode to a user mode or vice versa. In some embodiments users may also set one or more global modes.

A shipping mode is advantageous to keep battery drain as low as possible during shipping until it is in the user s hands. Generally no audio output during this mode is preferred and sleep times for the processor accelerometer and other electronics should be as long as possible. Waking up the timer from a shipping mode to a user mode or a retail mode or a demo mode may require a longer term action such as shaking for at least 10 seconds or a series of taps. A particular orientation may be used or also required. For example timers may normally be shipped with the OFF side up. If a shipping box is placed upside down or on its side then the angle of rotation is 180 or 90 from the OFF orientation. These angles may continue a shipping mode if one is already in progress. Note that an operating timer on a level surface would not stay at a 90 angle. One way to exit shipping mode would be to place timers on some other side such as one of the five faces surrounding OFF for a time period perhaps one minutes or more. Time periods of 1 to 1000 seconds or 5 to 500 seconds or 10 to 100 seconds or over 5 or over 10 or over 30 or over 60 seconds may be used for this exit from shipping mode change. Retail boxes for the timer may include the ability to place the retail box at such an angle to effect this exit from shipping mode. Ideally the timer generates an audio message when it exits the shipping mode.

Dishwasher mode. It is desirable to permit users to place the timers in a dishwasher. While in the dishwasher it is desirable to minimize power use and also to minimize or avoid completely audio announcements. Generally dishwashers create frequent motion due the water spray or mechanical vibration. This frequent motion may be detected causing the timer to enter dishwasher mode. Such a time period of frequent or constant motion may be more than 10 seconds or more than 20 30 60 120 180 or 240 seconds. Exiting the dishwasher mode may occur when the timer is still for period of time and has a face reasonably level such as within 5 10 15 20 30 or 45 degrees such as more than 10 seconds or more than 20 30 60 120 180 or 240 seconds. In addition the timer may need to have a particular face up such as OFF. An alternative or additional way to exit dishwasher mode may be to shake the timer for a minimum time period such as more than 0.5 1.0 1.5 2 3 5 7 10 15 30 or 60 seconds. Hand washing may also be treated as dishwasher mode but not necessarily.

Reset to default operating mode. It may be desirable to permit a user to reset operating modes to a known default. One way of achieving this reset is to shake the timer for a minimum period of time. Such a time period of frequent or constant motion may be more than 10 seconds or more than 5 20 30 60 120 180 or 240 seconds. In addition a particular face may need to be uppermost at the termination of the shaking such as the OFF face.

Programming modes. Global modes may typically be set at a factory or a distributor or a retailer. These modes may be for different timer models different feature sets different target markets different languages or to change a timer from a shipping mode to a user mode or vice versa. However it may be desirable to allow users to also set global modes although the set of possible user available modes is likely to a different set than possible modes set by the factory distributor or retailer. A novel method of programming global modes is to rotate the timer through a predetermined sequence of uppermost sides with one sequence for each desired mode. The necessary time period for each uppermost face in the sequence might be in the time range of 0.5 to 90 seconds 0.75 to 30 seconds 1 to 15 seconds 1 to 10 seconds or 1 to 5 seconds. Sequences may be two three four five six or more faces. For example one such sequence is starting from OFF no maximum time limit then to 7 then to 20 then to 5 and then back to OFF no maximum time limit . There may be sets of modes that are restricted to one mode per set e.g. language . There may be sets of modes where the mode is independent of other modes such as a verbose mode or a ticking while running mode.

Actions that may also be used for setting modes which may be stand alone actions or may be combined with the above face sequence actions include shaking or tapping. Taps may be counted. Counted taps to change mode may include 1 2 3 4 5 6 10 taps or a range of taps such as 2 to 3 or 3 to 5 or 5 to 10 taps.

Non limiting examples of modes are language of announcements tones used in announcements gender or accent of voice for announcements length of announcements verbose v. standard v. quiet mode ticking on or off vibration threshold announcement volume entering or exiting a shipping mode reset to one or more default modes audio output visual output or both entering or exiting a retail or demo mode.

Modes settable by the user may be cycled through a sequence by shaking the timer. For example modes may be sequenced from normal to verbose to quiet and then back to normal each time the timer is shaken. Modes may be set by the number of taps. For example four taps sets standard mode five taps sets quiet mode and six taps sets verbose mode.

For timers with wireless communication one or more change actions described above may enable or disable wireless communication.

Retail mode. It is desirable to have a retail or demo mode. Such a mode might be viewed as intermediate between shipping mode and user mode. Such a mode might include product demonstrations product use instructions or might prohibit certain other mode changes or combinations. For example a product demonstration might be simply announcing an uppermost face for example ten. However this demonstration might not require the timer to be still. Thus it may provide this audio demonstration while being held. This is distinct from normal operation where the intent of the user is typically not determined until after the timer has stopped moving. The retail mode may also be tolerant of some vibration without making an audio announcement or changing mode. A demo mode might be the same as a retail mode or may be a separate mode.

Instruction mode. It is useful to provide a mode whereby the timer provides audio instructions. Such a mode may be temporary in that when the audio instructions have been completed the mode exits. Such a mode may be entered by any of the mode change actions described elsewhere herein. For example shaking for a minimum time period may cause entry into the instruction mode. Also exit from retail mode to user made may cause instructions to be first provided.

Dropped mode. Ideally the timer withstands drops without damage. However it may be desirable to provide a unique audio message following a drop such as Ouch or Please do not drop the timer. The timer may provide such an audio message only once per a time period such as once per hour or once per day to minimize users making a game out of dropping the timer.

The timer may make an announcement after a cleaning mode such as I am now squeaky clean. Some messages may vary. Such variation may be random.

Carrying mode. The user after a user has set it frequently moves a timer. In this case the user typically does not wish to change or cancel a running interval. In some embodiments the timer detects that it is being moved and does not change a running interval. One way to do this is to note the maximum angle that the timer is rotated from its starting position while being moved. If a the timer is not rotated more than a first angle such as an angle in the range of 5 to 100 or the range of 10 to 90 or the range of 15 to 60 or the range of 20 to 50 and b the timer is placed at the end of the carry movement so that the previously uppermost face is again uppermost then carry mode may be assumed and the previously running interval or intervals are continued without interruption. It may be advantageous to make such an announcement for example previously set time of 10 minutes still running or 3 minutes left out of 30 minutes. 

Intermediate time announcements. Some people would like to know how much time is left on a running interval. A novel user action to cause a time remaining message to be announced is to pick up the timer tilt or shake it and place it back down with the original side face up again. Alternatively the timer may be tapped to cause a remaining time announcement.

Weak battery mode. It may be desirable to notify the user with an audio message when the battery is low. This mode may include instructions to the user on how to remedy the problem. For a sealed non rechargeable battery the instructions may include how to return the timer or how to purchase a replacement. For replaceable or chargeable batteries the instructions may include how to replace or recharge the battery. If there is a charging stand the timer s announcement may be Please place the timer on the charging stand. 

Charging. In one embodiment batteries are not chargeable. For embodiments with chargeable batteries batteries may be charged through timer case via electrical contacts typically on the face opposite the OFF face or may be charged via light or may be charged via an electromagnetic or electric field coupling through the case as those trained in the art understand. A Near Field Communication coil may be used for both communication and charging. Ideally a receiver for electromagnetic or electric field coupling is on the face opposite the OFF face.

For charging via light using solar cells as a receptor for example the receptor may be on or under any one or more faces. A novel method of charging via light is place the receptor on the face opposite the OFF face then use a charging base that provides upward directed light to the timer so that it may charges while sitting on the charging stand with the OFF face up. The charging base and receptor may use infrared IR light for example permitting the use of low cost and highly efficient infrared LEDs and receptors. Also the use of IR for charging is minimally intrusive. A novel feature of the capability is the use of an IR filter on or behind a face such that the receptor is not generally visible. Such a face may be or may appear to black or dark. For example a face with a legend of 60 may comprise a white legend on a black or dark background. Any charging stand may or may not detect the presence of a timer on the charging stand.

Electronic interface. In some embodiments the timer is programmable via a wireless electronic interface. Such an interface may be audio including frequencies above or below normal human hearing IR data Bluetooth WiFi Cellular data Near Field Communication NFC or other interfaces. Non limiting examples of programmability include firmware operating modes sounds or musical tones messages and optional features. One novel embodiment implements bi directional digital communication using audio signals. High quality audio messages may be updated reliably via such a digital audio interface.

Replaceable faces. Some embodiments include replaceable face legends. This replacement may be done at the factory a distributor a retailer or a user. Reasons for changing face legends include allowing a different set of times to be implemented implementing a different language on the legends use of opaque translucent or transparent faces and special features. One method of changing faces is the use of stickers. The previous face legends if any may or may not be removable. Another method of changing faces is to provide a slot on a face into which is placed a legend. The slot method has the advantage of providing a rugged cover over the legend. The use of transparent of translucent faces permits the use of an internal light that is visible when illuminated by users. Face legends may cover an entire face a portion of a face or cover no more than the legend itself.

Internal light. In some embodiments the timer has one or more internal lights. In one embodiment an internal light illuminates when a timing interval completes. This light may be on steady or pulse for example. It may stay on until the timer is moved up to some time limit such as one minute. A suitable range may be 10 seconds to 240 seconds or 20 to 180 seconds. The light may be a flash lamp. Such an output is suitable for people who are hearing impaired. Visual output may be combined with audio output or it may be the only notification of timer interval completion. If internal light is used one or more faces should be at least partially transparent or translucent. The timer may be manufactured from transparent or translucent plastic. In one embodiment light exits the timer case through the edges of the dodecahedron.

Braille. In one embodiment legends on one or more faces are in braille or are embossed legends such that a blind or sight impaired person can identify a face by feel. Also textures may be used to identify one or more faces. Also such tactile faces may be used at night or for people who do not have on their glasses. In one embodiment the OFF face has a distinctive texture or other tactile uniqueness. This allows the timer to be easily turned to the OFF rotation entirely by feel even for those people who are not sight impaired such as at night . Tactile legends of course may be combined with visual legends.

Communication Modes. Some people like their timer to be highly communicative. Some people like their timer to talk as little as possible. In some embodiments various operating modes permit either the user or a manufacturer distributor or retailer to set a verbosity mode. Three such possible modes may be identified as verbose normal and quiet. In a verbose mode for example more information is provide which might including ticking or regular intermediate time announcements or more instructions. In a quiet mode for example only completion of time intervals generate audio messages and possibly a minimal indication that a time has been set such as a short tone. Alternatively for quiet mode at the start of the time interval the interval length is announced then at the completion of the time interval a simpler output is provided such as a basic alarm or tone such as a ding. Some people like their timers to tick this provides some assurance that the timer is running. Turning on and off ticks may be an optional mode. Ticks may be provided in the verbose mode.

Modes may include a simple mode and an advanced mode. An advanced may included more features or options. A simple mode may limit features or options so as to provide more consistent operation.

Modes may include specific sets of features aimed at a particular target market. For example for classroom use setting exact time intervals may be important. For use by the elderly simpler operation and possibly maximum volume may be important. For use in a garden uppermost faces may not need to be horizontal to be recognized. For use in some teaching or therapy environments low volume and minimal messages may be appropriate. For use in factories or noisy environments high volume and attention getting sounds as well as a requirement for announcements to be positively recognized may be important. Various sizes of the timer may be appropriate for different environments or target markets. For example for use outdoors a large timer may be desirable.

Press to start. Ideally there is no drain on a battery between manufacturing and first use by as user. Some products use an insulating spacer between a battery terminal and a mating connector. The user removes the spacer to electrically connect the battery. A sealed product does not well support this method. A novel method of engaging a battery comprises having a timer case comprising two portions such as a left and right half . The two portions are pressed firmly together to connect a battery via a mechanical switch or contact points. This pressing together of the case portions may be non reversible. That is through the use of barbs ratchets clips snaps adhesive or other structures once the case portions are firmly pressed they cannot be parted. A seal may be provided between the case portions such as a rubber O ring pressure adhesive or a press fit seal. Thus pressing the case portions together not only connects the battery but also effectively seals the case in this embodiment.
