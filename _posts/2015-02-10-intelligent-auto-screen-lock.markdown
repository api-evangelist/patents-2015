The present disclosure relates generally to a user equipment UE and more particularly to techniques of operating a UE in a locked screen mode. For example the present disclosure describes techniques of automatically locking unlocking a screen display of a UE when a particular application is invoked or stopped.

A UE such as a mobile phone a touch screen computer or a tablet computer may have a touch panel functioning as an input device. The touch panel remains active even when the UE is running an active application such as a video streaming program a video chat program or etc. An unintentional touch on the touch panel may disturb such an active application. Accordingly there is a need to improve user experience.

In an aspect of the disclosure a method a computer program product and an apparatus are provided. The apparatus may be a UE. The UE has a screen display. The UE detects that at least one image is being rendered by a first application in a predetermined display mode at the screen display. The UE receives a first input through an input device. The first input instructs the UE to perform a function. The UE discards the first input and continuing displaying the at least one image based on a predetermined rule.

The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts. Apparatuses and methods will be described in the following detailed description and may be illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks modules components circuits steps processes algorithms elements etc.

Several aspects of a UE will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks modules components circuits steps processes algorithms etc. collectively referred to as elements . These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware computer software or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.

By way of example an element or any portion of an element or any combination of elements may be implemented with a processing system that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors microcontrollers digital signal processors DSPs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs programmable logic devices PLDs state machines gated logic discrete hardware circuits and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions instruction sets code code segments program code programs subprograms software modules applications software applications software packages routines subroutines objects executables threads of execution procedures functions etc. whether referred to as software firmware middleware microcode hardware description language or otherwise.

Accordingly in one or more exemplary embodiments the functions described may be implemented in hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. If implemented in software the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable medium. Computer readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example and not limitation such computer readable media can comprise a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM an electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM compact disk ROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.

A UE may be configured to enter a locked screen mode after waiting for a specific amount of time user configurable from the time an active application such as a video streaming program started. User can manually unlock a locked screen by for example hard pressing the power key for a specific duration or long pressing on touch panel to unlock the screen. Further the locked screen may be automatically unlocked to a normal mode when the active application such as a video streaming program or a video chat program has ended. The locked screen may also be automatically unlocked to a normal mode when the UE receives an incoming voice call or a request from other high priority applications that need immediate user attention.

An exemplary UE has among other components a processor a memory an input device a display device a storage and a network controller . In certain configurations the UE may have more than one processor or more than one each of the other components described supra. Examples of the processor include microprocessors microcontrollers digital signal processors DSPs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs programmable logic devices PLDs state machines gated logic discrete hardware circuits and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. The one or more processors may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions instruction sets code code segments program code programs subprograms software modules applications software applications software packages routines subroutines objects executables threads of execution procedures functions etc. whether referred to as software firmware middleware microcode hardware description language or otherwise. The memory is a volatile data storage device such as a RAM. The memory is a non volatile data storage device such as a flash memory or a solid state memory device. The storage may be a distributed memory device with separate data stores coupled to the processor . The input device may be a keyboard a mouse a touch screen touch panel etc. The components of the UE may communicate through a system bus . An operating system OS or other system management software manages and allocates the resources of the components of the UE . Particularly the OS has an input device driver that manages the input device a video driver that manages graphic display and a network interface driver that manages the network controller .

One or more applications may run on the OS . As an illustrative example and for clarity shows a first application and a second application running on the OS . For example the first application may be a video streaming program. The second application may be a web browser program. The UE also has a screen lock control module in communication with the first application the second application and components of the OS particularly the input device driver the video driver and the network interface driver .

In one configuration the screen lock control module may be a module that runs on top or within the OS utilizing the processor and the memory . Thus the screen lock control module may communicate with the first application the second application the input device driver the video driver and the network interface driver through interfaces provided by the OS . As will be described infra the screen lock control module may reside in the memory . The processor may read processing instructions and code of the screen lock control module from the memory . Accordingly the processor may be configured to detect that at least one image is being rendered in a predetermined display mode at the screen display. The processor may be configured to receive a first input through an input device. The first input instructs the UE to perform a function. The processor may be configured to discard the first input and continue displaying the at least one image based on a predetermined rule.

In another configuration the screen lock control module may be implemented as a screen lock control module that is a controller with its own processing unit and memory unit and that may communicate with the first application the second application the OS through the system bus . As will be described infra the screen lock control module may utilize its own processing and memory units to detect that at least one image is being rendered in a predetermined display mode at the screen display. The screen lock control module may utilize its own processing and memory units to receive a first input through an input device. The first input instructs the UE to perform a function. The screen lock control module may utilize its own processing and memory units to discard the first input and continue displaying the at least one image based on a predetermined rule.

The UE may be implemented with a bus architecture represented generally by the system bus . The system bus may include any number of interconnecting buses and bridges depending on the specific application of the UE and the overall design constraints. The system bus links together various circuits including one or more processors and or hardware modules represented by the processor the modules and the computer readable medium memory . The system bus may also link various other circuits such as timing sources peripherals voltage regulators and power management circuits which are well known in the art and therefore will not be described any further.

The processor is coupled to the computer readable medium memory . The processor is responsible for general processing including the execution of software stored on the computer readable medium memory . The software when executed by the processor causes the UE to perform the various functions described infra for any particular apparatus. The computer readable medium memory may also be used for storing data that is manipulated by the processor when executing software. The UE further includes at least one of the modules and . The modules may be software modules running in the processor resident stored in the computer readable medium memory one or more hardware modules coupled to the processor or some combination thereof.

The registration component may receive registration requests from multiple applications running on the OS . An application may request to be added on the lock screen application list or the high priority application list . Further the registration component may inquire about certain characteristics e.g. as defined in the rule component of an application and determine whether that application should be added on the lock screen application list or the high priority application list based on those characteristics. For example the rule component may define that an application having functions of displaying pictures photos presentation slides videos or other multimedia formats should be included in the lock screen application list . The rule component may define that an application having direct communications functions of such as conducting voice calls or video calls should be included in the high priority application list .

The OS may designate one of the multiple applications as an active application . The rest of the multiple applications are inactive applications . The active application receives input events generated by input device driver . The user interface of the active application may be displayed on top of the user interfaces of the inactive applications . An inactive application may request the OS to switch the status of that inactive application from inactive to active. Further the OS may switch the status of an inactive application from inactive to active based on an input from a user or the operation of the inactive application . In this configuration as will be described supra in certain circumstances the switching request also needs to be allowed by the screen lock control module . Particularly the OS or the requesting inactive application may send the switching request to the management component . The management component may determine whether to approve the switch request based on whether the requesting inactive application is on the high priority application list . Once receiving an approval from the screen lock control module the OS may switch the status of the active application e.g. the first application from active to inactive and switch the status of the requesting inactive application e.g. the second application from inactive to active. Accordingly the previous requesting inactive application e.g. the second application becomes the current active application . The previous active application e.g. the first application becomes an inactive application .

The management component may communicate with the active application the network interface driver the video driver and the OS and may determine a display mode of the active application based on information obtained from those components. For example based on the activities of the network interface driver and the display functions of the active application the management component can determine whether the video streaming program is in a video streaming mode. As another example based on information obtained from the active application and or the video driver the management component may determine whether a presentation program is in a full screen presentation mode. As will be described supra based on the display mode of the active application and predetermined rules defined in the rule component the management component can determine whether to lock the screen.

The screen lock control module has a timer which may be utilized by the management component to determine whether an operation has lasted a predetermined time period. Further the management component configures the OS and or the input device driver to transmit all the input events generated by the OS and or input device driver to the management component . The management component then determines whether to transfer the received input events to the targeted application such as the active application based on the lock screen application list the high priority application list the display mode of the active application and or a predetermined rule of the rule component . When the screen lock control module does not transfer the input events generated in response to the user input to the active application the active application does not respond to the user input as the active application is supposed to. Particularly the display of the active application may not be changed in response to the user inputs. Therefore the user may perceive that the screen of the UE is locked. 

If the active application is on the lock screen application list the screen lock control module at operation determines a display mode of the active application . Then the screen lock control module determines whether the display mode is a to be protected display mode defined by a rule of the rule component . For example the active application may be a video streaming application and may be playing a video received from a network e.g. Internet using a streaming mechanism. The rule configured at the rule component may define such a streaming display mode where the video buffer of the UE has started buffering video content as a to be protected display mode. As another example the active application may be a presentation program and may have started presenting slides in a full screen presentation mode. The rule configured at the rule component may define such a full screen presentation mode as a to be protected display mode.

Upon determining that the active application is in a to be protected display mode the screen lock control module determines at operation whether the screen lock control module entered the locked screen mode previously for the active application according to a locked application record of the screen lock control module this operation will be described in detail supra . If the screen lock control module entered the locked screen mode previously for the active application the procedure enters operation illustrated in . If the screen lock control module did not enter the locked screen mode previously for the active application the screen lock control module at operation sets the timer to a predetermined value e.g. 1 2 5 or 10 seconds and starts the timer . This value specifies a time period that the screen lock control module should wait before entering the locked screen mode. Subsequently the procedure enters operation illustrated in . In other words if the screen lock control module previously entered the locked screen mode for the active application then the screen lock control module may enter the locked screen mode again directly without waiting a predetermined time period wait period . For example if an interruption to a video streaming program by an active voice call or a high priority application has ended the video streaming program may resume operation in the locked screen mode directly without waiting for the predetermined time period. Further the predetermined value of the wait period is configurable by another program or a user. For example the screen lock control module may provide a user interface through which a user may input a predetermined value of the wait period e.g. 5 seconds . The screen lock control module may provide an application programming interface through which another application may call a configuration function to input a predetermined value of the wait period.

Upon determining at operation that the active application is not in a to be protected display mode the procedure enters operation illustrated in .

If the screen lock control module determines at operation that the active application is not on the lock screen application list then at operation the screen lock control module operates in a normal mode and waits to receive input events sent by the input device driver . For example the active application may be the second application i.e. the web browser program . At operation the screen lock control module may receive an input event directed to a targeted application i.e. the active application . In the normal mode at operation the screen lock control module may simply transfer forward the input event to the targeted application e.g. the web browser program . For example the input event may be a click event directed to the web browser program. The screen lock control module transfers the input event to the web browser program which may in response displays a new webpage at the web address selected by the click event.

Within operation at operation the screen lock control module may receive a switching request to assign another application as the active application . For example the UE may receive a voice call. Thus the OS may request to assign a voice call program as the active application and to display a user interface of the voice call program such that a user of the UE may answer the voice call. In the normal mode at operation the screen lock control module may always approve the switching request. At operation the current procedure ends and a new procedure starts at operation when the screen lock control module detects that the OS has switched to a new active application .

Upon determining that the input event received does not represent an input matching the pattern the screen lock control module at operation may discard the input events. In other words the active application e.g. the video streaming program may be displaying images while the screen lock control module operates in the locked screen mode. The screen lock control module does not transfer the inputs received from the input device to the active application . A user may perceive that the screen of the UE is locked because inputs at the input device do not affect the display at the display device . Optionally at operation the screen lock control module may generate another input event or message specifying the input received from the input device and send the input event or message to the active application . In response to the generated input event or message the active application may play a notice such as an icon on the screen or a sound. Alternatively the screen lock control module may directly instruct the UE e.g. through the OS to play an icon or a sound. As such the UE alters the user of the UE that an input is received. The user may choose to interrupt the locked screen mode by enter an input matching the pattern e.g. long press on the touch screen or a specific button defined in the rule component . Subsequently the screen lock control module returns to operation and continues waiting for other input events.

Upon determining that the input event received does represent an input matching the pattern the screen lock control module at operation determines that the user wants to exit the locked screen mode. Accordingly the screen lock control module may reset the timer to the predetermined value. Further the screen lock control module may set a user unlock record indicating that the user wants the screen lock control module to operate in the normal mode even the display mode of the current active application is a to be protected display mode. Subsequently the procedure enters operation illustrated in .

Within operation at operation the screen lock control module may receive a switching request to assign another application as the active application . For example the UE may receive a voice call. Thus the OS may request to assign a voice call program as the active application and to display a user interface of the voice call program such that a user of the UE may answer the voice call. In the locked screen mode at operation the screen lock control module may only approve the switching request for assigning an application on the high priority application list as the new active application . At operation the screen lock control module determines whether the another application is on the high priority application list . For example the registration component and or the rule component may have added the voice call program to the high priority application list . In contrast a messenger chat program may not be added on the high priority application list .

Upon determine that the another application e.g. the voice call program is on the high priority application list at operation the screen lock control module keeps a locked application record indicating that the screen lock control module has entered the locked screen mode for the current active application e.g. the video streaming program . Accordingly in this example when the UE receives a voice call the screen lock control module allows the voice call program to be assigned as the new active application and the video streaming program to be assigned as an inactive application . Therefore a user of the UE may use the input device to answer the voice call. Once the voice call is finished the OS switches the video streaming program back to the active application . Further based on the locked application record at operation the screen lock control module can determine that the screen lock control module has entered the locked screen mode for the first application . Thus upon switching back to the video streaming program as the active application the screen lock control module may choose to enter the locked screen mode for the video streaming program immediately without waiting for a predetermined time period defined by the rule component and or timer . At operation the screen lock control module allows assigning the another application as the new active application . Subsequently at operation the current procedure ends and a new procedure starts at operation when the screen lock control module detects that the OS has switched to a new active application .

Upon determining that the switching request is not for an application on the high priority application list the screen lock control module at operation may disallow the switching request. For example the UE may receive a messenger message and the OS may request the screen lock control module to allow the messenger program to be assigned as the active application such that the user of the UE may use the input device to reply the message through the messenger program. In this example because the messenger program is not on the high priority application list the screen lock control module discards the switching request for the messenger program. Optionally the screen lock control module may generate another input event or message specifying the switching request received from the input device and send the input event or message to the active application . In response to the generated input event or message the active application may play a notice such as an icon on the screen or a sound. Alternatively the screen lock control module may directly instruct the UE e.g. through the OS to play an icon or a sound. As such the UE alerts a user that a switching request is received. The user may choose to interrupt the locked screen mode by enter an input matching the pattern e.g. long press on the touch screen or a specific button defined in the rule component . Subsequently the screen lock control module returns to operation and continues waiting for other input events.

Further after the screen lock control module has waited to receive input events for a predetermined time period e.g. 0.5 second the procedure enters operation . At operation the screen lock control module determines a display mode of the active application . Then the screen lock control module determines whether the display mode is a to be protected display mode defined by a rule of the rule component . Particularly the screen lock control module may determine whether the active application has finished displaying a content program and thus has exited the to be protected display mode. In one example the active application may be a video streaming program and the screen lock control module determines whether the video streaming program has finished streaming a program such as a movie. In another example the active application may be a presentation program and the screen lock control module may determine whether a slide presentation ended or whether the presentation program has exited a full screen presentation mode.

Upon determining that the active application is in a to be protected display mode the procedure returns to operation at which the screen lock control module waits for another predetermined time period e.g. 0.5 second to receive input events. Upon determining that the active application is not in a to be protected display mode the screen lock control module may at operation determines whether there is a user lock record indicating that the user wants the screen lock control module to operate in a locked screen mode although the display mode of the current active application is not a to be protected display mode. Upon determining that there is such a user lock record the procedure returns to operation at which the screen lock control module waits for another predetermined time period e.g. 0.5 second to receive input events. Upon determining that there is no such a user lock record the screen lock control module may at operation reset the timer to the predetermined value. Subsequently the procedure enters operation illustrated in .

Within operation the screen lock control module at operation receives an input event from the input device driver . In certain circumstances a user of the UE may want the screen lock control module to enter the locked screen mode. The rule component may define a predetermined input pattern by applying which the user may instruct the controller to exit the locked screen mode. At operation the screen lock control module determines whether the input event represents an input matching a pattern defined at the rule component . For example the predetermined input pattern may be a long press on the touch screen or a long press on a specific button of the device.

Upon determining that the input event received does not represent an input matching the pattern the screen lock control module at operation may simply transfer forward the input event to the active application i.e. the targeted application . For example the input event may be a click event on a play button directed to the video streaming program. The screen lock control module transfers the input event to the video streaming program which may in response play a video streaming program.

Upon determining that the input event received does represent an input matching the pattern the screen lock control module at operation may set a user lock record indicating that the user wants the screen lock control module to operate in a locked screen mode although the display mode of the current active application is not a to be protected display mode. Subsequently the procedure enters operation illustrated in .

Further after the screen lock control module has waited to receive input events for a predetermined time period e.g. 0.5 second the procedure enters operation . At operation the screen lock control module determines a display mode of the active application . Then the screen lock control module determines whether the display mode is a to be protected display mode defined by a rule of the rule component . For example the active application which is on the lock screen application list may be a video streaming program and the screen lock control module may determine whether the video streaming program has entered into a streaming display mode. As another example the active application may be a presentation program and the screen lock control module may determine whether the presentation program has entered into a full screen presentation mode.

Upon determining that the active application is in a to be protected display mode the screen lock control module determines at operation whether there is a user unlock record indicating that the user wants the screen lock control module to operate in a normal mode although the display mode of the current active application is a to be protected display mode.

Upon determining that there is such a user unlock record at operation the screen lock control module may reset the timer to the predetermined value e.g. 5 seconds . Subsequently the procedure returns to operation at which the screen lock control module waits for another predetermined time period e.g. 0.5 second to receive input events.

Upon determining that there is no such a user unlock record at operation the screen lock control module determines whether the timer has reached 0. In other words the screen lock control module determines whether the predetermined time period has passed before the screen lock control module enters the locked screen mode. Upon determining that the timer has reached 0 the procedure enters operation illustrated in . Upon determining that the timer has not reached 0 the procedure returns to operation at which the screen lock control module waits for another predetermined time period e.g. 0.5 second to receive input events.

Further within operation at operation the screen lock control module may receive a switching request to assign another application as the active application . For example the UE may receive a voice call. Thus the OS may request to assign a voice call program as the active application and to display a user interface of the voice call program such that a user of the UE may answer the voice call. In the normal mode at operation the screen lock control module approves the switching request. At operation the current procedure ends and a new procedure starts at operation when the screen lock control module detects that the OS has switched to a new active application e.g. the voice call program .

At operation the UE receives a first input through an input device. The first input instructs the UE to perform a function e.g. operation in . At operation the UE discards the first input and continues displaying the at least one image based on a predetermined rule e.g. operation in . Optionally the UE discards the first input from a second time point that is a predetermined time period subsequent to the first time point e.g. operation in . The predetermined rule may define discarding the first input when the first application is on a first list of applications e.g. operation in . To detect that the at least one image is being rendered by the first application in the predetermined display mode the UE may detect that a video is being rendered at the screen display. The predetermined rule may define discarding the first input when the video is streamed to the UE. At operation the UE may determine a third time point at which the rendering of the at least one image is stopped e.g. operation in . At operation the UE may stop discarding the first input after the third time point e.g. operation in .

In certain configurations the UE utilizes the screen lock control module to perform the procedures illustrated in . The screen lock control module may reside in the memory . The processor may read processing instructions and code of the screen lock control module from the memory . Accordingly the processor may be configured to perform the procedures illustrated in .

The apparatus includes means for discarding the first input and continuing displaying the at least one image based on a predetermined rule.

The predetermined rule may define discarding the first input when the first application is on a first list of applications. The means for detecting that the at least one image is being rendered by the first application in the predetermined display mode may be configured to detect that a video is being rendered at the screen display. The predetermined rule may define discarding the first input when the video is streamed to the UE.

The apparatus may include means for determining a first time point at which the rendering of the at least one image is started.
