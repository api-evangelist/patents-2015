This patent arises from a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 697 997 entitled UPDATING A SUPPORTED SUPPLIES DATABASE OF AN IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS which was filed on Nov. 14 2012 and is a U.S. national stage of PCT Application Serial No. PCT US10 37075 filed on Jun. 2 2010. Priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 697 997 and PCT Application Serial No. PCT US10 37075 is hereby claimed. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 697 997 and PCT Application Serial No. PCT US10 37075 are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

Image forming apparatus such as printers are designed and or intended to be used with only certain imaging supplies. Example imaging supplies include but are not limited to an ink cartridge a toner cartridge etc. The list of supported imaging supplies is embedded into the firmware and or the software of the image forming apparatus. The list of supported imaging supplies may be used and or accessed by a user of the image forming apparatus to determine or identify which supplies are compatible with the image forming apparatus and or to order compatible supplies.

Because the list of imaging supplies e.g. an ink cartridge a toner cartridge etc. supported by an image forming apparatus e.g. a printer an inkjet printer a dye sublimation printer a laser printer a color laser printer etc. is traditionally determined selected and or fixed during product design it may be difficult to add change and or remove a supported imaging supply late in the product design cycle during product testing after product testing during product release during market introduction while a product is being sold after a product has been sold and or after a product has been discontinued. For example when the list of supported imaging supplies is changed after product testing and or product validation has been completed changing the firmware and or software to add change and or remove a supported imaging supply can result in lengthy and or expensive repetition of product testing. Such delays and or costs may cause customer frustration lost sales delayed product introduction increased research and development costs delay the development of other products and or result in lost profits.

Example methods apparatus and articles of manufacture to update supported supplies databases of image forming apparatus such as printers are disclosed. An example disclosed image forming apparatus implements a dynamic list of supported imaging supplies that are referenced by and or referred to by the printer s software and or firmware rather than being embedded into the software and or firmware. Because the example supported supplies database is not embedded into the firmware and or the software of the image forming apparatus the database can be updated changed replaced and or modified even after the image forming apparatus has been tested released sold distributed or even discontinued. In examples described herein the supported supplies database of the imaging forming apparatus is updated based on information commands and or data stored in and or obtained from an update imaging supply. As used herein the term update imaging supply refers to an imaging supply containing information commands and or data that may be accessed by an image forming device and used by the image forming device to update its supported supplies database. When for example an update imaging supply is inserted into the image forming apparatus the image forming apparatus interacts with the update imaging supply to obtain access and or read the supported supplies update information data and or commands stored on the inserted imaging supply and the imaging forming apparatus updates its supported supplies database accordingly. The supported supplies updated information stored in an imaging supply can for example indicate that one or more supplies are to be added possibly including the inserted imaging supply itself to the supported supplies data that one or more supplies are to be removed possibly including the inserted imaging supply itself from the supported supplies data and or that all or a portion of the supported supplies database is to be replaced.

A disclosed example method to update a supported supplies database of an image forming apparatus includes detecting insertion of an imaging supply into the image forming apparatus interacting with the inserted imaging supply to obtain a supply identifier the supply identifier representing an additional supported imaging supply for the image forming apparatus and adding the obtained supply identifier to the supported supplies database of the image forming apparatus

A disclosed example apparatus to update a supported supplies database of an image forming apparatus includes a communication module to detect insertion of an imaging supply into the image forming apparatus a security module to interact with the inserted imaging supply to obtain a supply identifier via the communication module the supply identifier representing an imaging supply for the image forming apparatus and an action identifier associated with the imaging supply and a database update module to add the obtained supply identifier to the supported supplies database of the image forming apparatus or remove the identifier from the database based on the action identifier.

The example image forming apparatus of may be a printer e.g. an inkjet printer a dye sublimation printer a laser printer a color laser printer etc. and or any other additional and or alternative device capable of forming an image on any type s of media . The example update imaging supply may be an ink cartridge a toner cartridge a tank a container and or any other additional and or alternative device that supplies a material e.g. an ink a dye a toner etc. useable by the example printer and or the imaging supply to form an image on the media . As described below the example imaging supply of is structured configured and or programmed to communicate with at least one component of the example image forming apparatus . For ease of discussion the following descriptions will focus on an example in which the image forming apparatus is implemented by a printer and the update supply is implemented by an update cartridge. The example image forming apparatus of will hereafter be referred to as the printer and the example imaging supply will hereafter be referred to as the update cartridge . As used herein the term update cartridge refers to a cartridge containing information commands and or data that may be accessed by an image forming apparatus and used by the image forming device to update its supported supplies database.

To print images the example printer of includes a print engine and the example update cartridge of includes any number and or type s of print heads one of which is designated at reference numeral and any number and or type s of containers one of which is designated at reference numeral . The example update cartridge of is insertable into a slot carrier receptacle holder and or supply bay of the example printer . The example supply bay of communicatively couples the example print engine to the example print head and physically positions and or moves the example print head relative to print media . For example the supply bay may include any number and or type s of connectors and or conductors not shown that electrically and or communicatively couple the print engine to the print head . The example supply bay also communicatively couples a security device of the update cartridge to a controller of the printer via respective inter integrated circuit IC interfaces and .

Using any number and or type s of message s command s method s logic protocol s signal s and or process es the example print engine of communicates with the example print head to control the application of one or more ink s dye s liquid s toner s and or any other material s contained in the example container s onto the media to form text and or images on the media . The example print head of applies the one or more ink s dye s liquid s toner s and or any other material s contained in the example container onto the media using any number and or type s of process es method s and or printing pass es .

While a single update cartridge and a single bay are shown in the example printer may include more than one bay to allow the printer to form text and or images on the media using more than one update cartridge . When more than one bay is present associated cartridges may operate simultaneously and or sequentially. When forming some example images on the media only a subset of the cartridges need be used. For example a black and white image may be formed using only a black ink update cartridge leaving any color ink cartridges inactive. Further while the example update cartridge of includes the example print head one or more print heads may alternatively be implemented by and or within the printer .

To manage the supported supplies database the example printer of includes the example controller . The example controller of detects installed cartridge s and interacts with installed cartridge s e.g. the example update cartridge to determine whether an installed update cartridge includes contains and or can provide supported supplies database update data e.g. the example update data . When supported supplies database update data is available the example controller obtains and or receives the data from the installed update cartridge and updates the supported supplies database based on the obtained data . The example controller of may also implement any number and or type s of other functions and or features related to other aspects of the example printer such as initialization maintenance and or configuration. An example data structure that may be used to implement the example update data of is described below in connection with . An example manner of implementing the example controller is described below in connection with .

The example security device may be any number and or type s of security device capable to securely store the update data and to authenticate the security device and or the update cartridge containing the security device to the example printer . In the example of the controller and the security device implement and or carry out any number and or type s of security and or authentication protocol s and or message s that allow the controller to authenticate the identity of the security device and or the update data and or for the security device to authenticate the identity of the controller and or the printer prior to providing the update data to the printer . In the example of the controller and the security device implement a two trip authentication protocol based on an authentication key securely stored in a security device of the printer . While the illustrated example of employs authentication and secure data storage to prevent unauthorized access to the update data and or to ensure the update data has not been tampered with a supported supplies database of an image forming apparatus may be updated without authentication and or secure data storage obviating the need for the example security device and the security device e.g. the update data can be stored in an unsecured memory .

To communicatively couple the example controller to the example security device the example update cartridge of includes the example IC interface and the example printer of includes the example IC interface . The example IC interfaces and of implement and or form a communication bus protocol and or path over one or more electrical connections formed between the printer and the update cartridge when the update cartridge is inserted into the supply bay . Via the communication bus protocol and or path implemented by the example IC interfaces and the example controller can authenticate the security device and or obtain and or read the update data . In some examples the print engine and or the controller interact with the print head via the IC interfaces and . Additionally or alternatively the print engine and or the controller interact with the print head via other electrical connections formed when the update cartridge is inserted into the supply bay . While IC interfaces and are depicted in any number and or type s of additional and or alternatively communication interface s device s module s and or protocol s may be used to communicatively couple the controller to the security device .

While the example update cartridge of includes the example security device and the example supported supplies database update data another cartridge supported by the printer need not include the security device and or supported supplies database update data . For example only special purpose update cartridges may include the example security device and the example supported supplies database update data . These special purpose updated cartridges could be manufactured and or sold e.g. at a premium relative to cartridges that are no special purpose given to high volume and or high value customers etc. to allow users to upgrade their printers . Additionally and or alternatively a manufacture could include the example security device and the example supported supplies database update data in one or more update cartridges to enable automatic updates of supported supplies databases prior to for example the introduction of a new cartridge type and or the discontinuation of a cartridge type. In some examples supported supplies database updates occur without user knowledge and or user interaction. In other examples a user of the printer needs to confirm allow and or acknowledge the update s e.g. using one or more buttons of the printer and or via a user interface implemented by a computer communicatively coupled to the printer prior to the update s being applied. In some examples a user may need to provide a security and or access key and or identifier prior to the supported supplies database being updated. Additionally or alternatively if the example supported supplies database cannot and or was not properly updated the controller may provide an error indication via for example a light emitting diode and or a display implemented by the printer not shown and or via a user interface presented on a computer communicatively coupled to the printer .

The example supported supplies database of may be implemented using any number and or type s of data structure s . An example data structure that may be used to implement the example supported supplies database is described below in connection with . The example supported supplies database may be stored in any number and or type s of memory ies memory device s storage device s and or any other tangible computer readable medium.

If the supply is already in the table block control returns from the example machine accessible instructions of without making any changes to the table .

If the supply is not in the table block the update module determines whether the table is full block . If the table is full block control returns from the example machine accessible instructions of without making any changes to the table .

If the table is not full block the update module identifies where in the table the supply is to be inserted block . Any entries located at and below the identified location are shifted downward and their indexes are adjusted accordingly e.g. increased by one block . A new entry containing the additional supply is added to the table at the identified location block and control exits from the example machine accessible instructions of .

The example machine accessible instructions of may be executed to remove a update cartridge from a table of the example supported supplies database of . The example supported supplies database update module determines whether the supply identified in the supply field is in the table block . If the supply is not in the table block control returns from the example machine accessible instructions of without making any changes to the table .

If the supply is in the table block the update module identifies where in the table the supply is located block . The identified entry is removed and any corresponding data structures are overwritten with nil values block . Any entries located at or below the removed entry are shifted upward in the table and their indexes are adjusted accordingly e.g. decreased by one block . Control then exits from the example machine accessible instructions of .

The processor platform P of the example of includes at least one programmable processor P. The processor P executes coded instructions P and or P present in main memory of the processor P e.g. within a RAM P and or a ROM P . The processor P may be any type of processing unit such as a processor core a processor and or a microcontroller.
