The present disclosure generally relates to access control for security administration and more particularly to systems and methods for providing access control to computer network based and web based services.

One of the most important challenges for providing services on large networks such as the Internet is administration of security for access to those services which can include merchant services and financial transactions and involve different levels of access to various types of information for different users.

A number of different types of access controls have arisen out of these challenges. Two of these are Discretionary Access Controls DAC and Mandatory Access Controls MAC . DAC is an access control system that permits system users to allow or disallow other users to have access to objects e.g. information application programs devices under their control. According to one definition DAC includes controls that are discretionary in the sense that a subject e.g. system user with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission perhaps indirectly on to any other subject unless restrained by mandatory access control . MAC according to one definition provides a means of restricting access to objects based on the sensitivity as represented by a label of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization i.e. clearance of subjects to access information of such sensitivity. In general MAC is more centrally administered than DAC e.g. access policy is determined by the system and usually not by individual users e.g. an owner of the information as could occur with DAC . With MAC security administration can be costly and prone to error because administrators usually specify access control lists for each user on the system individually.

A more recent development is Role Based Access Control RBAC in which like MAC access policy is determined more by the system than by the owner e.g. access is not discretionary based on existing permissions . A subject e.g. system user is assigned one or more roles and authorization is based on each resource and action in the system requiring membership in a particular role in order to proceed. With RBAC security may be managed at a level that corresponds closely to the organization s structure. Each user is assigned one or more roles and each role is assigned one or more privileges that are permitted to users in that role. Security administration with RBAC includes determining the operations that must be executed by persons in particular jobs and assigning users to the proper roles.

Another example is Attribute Based Access Control ABAC in which access is granted based on attributes of the subject e.g. the user the resource e.g. object being accessed the action the user wants to perform on or with the resource and the environment. For example the user s name and password the privacy aspects of the object e.g. account information whether read or write access is sought and type of encryption being used may be values of attributes that can affect whether an access is granted or denied under ABAC.

According to one or more embodiments of the present invention methods and systems for access control provide enhanced access control security through the use of a unique combination of authentication context confidence estimation identity assurance risk assessment attributes and roles that may be included in an underlying role based attribute based access control RABAC model. Access control may be provided for users to connect to services and resources of a service provider SP over a network such as the Internet or a local area network LAN using a consumer electronic device for example to connect to servers operated by the service provider.

In one or more embodiments a system provides access control for access by an access device to the system and includes a server executing a server application for communication with the access device in which the server application receives an identity claim from the access device an authentication service in communication with the server in which the authentication service receives the identity claim from the server application a risk service in communication with the authentication service in which the risk service provides a risk evaluation to the authentication service based on applying a risk model to the identity claim and the authentication service provides a token to the server application based on the identity claim and the risk evaluation and an authorization service in communication with the server application and the risk service in which the authorization service receives the token from the server application and the authorization service provides a response whether to allow access to the system by the access device according to the token and input from a risk based access control a role based access control and an attribute based access control.

In another embodiment a computer implemented method includes receiving an access request from a user device wherein the access request includes an identity claim for a user evaluating a risk based on matching an attribute of the user device with attributes stored in a user information database authenticating the access request based on the identity claim and the risk evaluation to determine an authentication confidence level generating a token based on the confidence level and the attribute matched and producing an authorization response based on inputs from the token a risk based access control a role based access control and an attribute based access control in which the authorization response determines whether to allow access to a system deny access to the system or request additional input from the user device.

In a further embodiment a computer program product comprises a non transitory computer readable medium having computer readable and executable code for instructing a processor to perform a method that includes receiving an access request from a user device wherein the access request includes an identity claim for a user evaluating a risk based on matching an attribute of the user device with attributes stored in a user information database authenticating the access request based on the identity claim and the risk evaluation to determine an authentication confidence level generating a token based on the authentication confidence level and the attribute matched and producing an authorization response based on inputs from the token a risk based access control a role based access control and an attribute based access control in which the authorization response determines whether to allow access to a system deny access to the system or request additional input from the user device.

In accordance with embodiments of the present invention access control may be provided for users to connect to services and resources of a service provider SP over a network such as the Internet or a local area network LAN using for example a consumer electronic device to connect to servers operated by the service provider. Access control security may be enhanced through the use of a unique combination of authentication context confidence estimation identity assurance risk assessment attributes and roles that may be included in an underlying role based attribute based access control RABAC model. The user may establish an identity with the service provider through a process referred to as on boarding . The on boarding process may establish attributes of the user s identity that can be asserted as claims for purposes of authentication in subsequent requests to access the system.

User wishing to access services provided by the service provider may enter claims which may include for example credentials and identity claims into user device . In general a claim may be regarded as an assertion of the truth of something typically something which may be disputed or in doubt. An implicit claim may be one that is not explicitly entered by a subject and an explicit claim may be one that is explicitly entered by a subject. An attribute may refer to a verified claim where verification can be performed for example by the service provider a third party or may be self asserted for certain types of claims. Thus verification or identity proofing may be regarded as a process of converting claims to attributes. The definition of verification may assume that there is an assurance level e.g. confidence which may be expressed as probability level from 0 to 100 commensurate with the intended use of the identity or claim within the system. Authentication may be regarded as a process in which the subject s assertion of a particular identity in the system is validated and a binding of the subject and the particular identity occurs. A confidence level may be expressed on the binding. Authentication and binding also apply to matching claims to attributes Authorization is generally based on the assurance of identity proofing and confidence level of authentication for a particular session authorization may in general refer to providing a determination of what a subject can do on the system.

The claims may be included with information which may also include such things as attributes e.g. international mobile equipment identification IMEI number of user device and be transmitted for example via a network such as the Internet to server of service provider system for use by applications . For example server application may communicate through PEP authentication information to authentication services . Authentication services may have access to a user information database which may be used to store user identities e.g. credentials and claims associated with each user. Authentication services may have access to processes running on a policy server which may provide policy decisions for example for expressing or applying rules that evaluate identity and authentication level trust scoring along with rules to render decisions using a combination of role and attribute based expressions. Authentication services also may be as shown in in communication with risk services . Authentication services may use as input identity claims e.g. included in claims information and authentication information information from user information database information from policy server and information e.g. risk evaluation from risk services to provide a token to server application via PEP . As seen in token may for example form an assertion including an authorization context e.g. information added to the assertion that provides the details needed for the server application to make an informed entitlement decision and may be based on the user credentials and inputs just described.

Server application may send a token to authorization services for example via PEP . The token as seen in may include an assertion for functionality authorization e.g. an assertion of what the subject can do on the system . The authorization services may receive the token from the server application and may also communicate with and receive inputs from risk services and user information database as shown in . The authorization services may provide a response whether to allow access to the system by the access device according to input from the token and input from a risk based access control e.g. input from risk services a role based access control model and policies and an attribute based access control model and policies both or either of which may use input from user information database . In an alternative embodiment the authentication services may provide a response whether to allow access to the system by the access device according to an authentication confidence level a role based access control model and policies and an attribute based access control model and policies both or either of which may use input from user information database .

Computation or processing of the response by authorization services or in the alternative example response by authentication services may incorporate any combination of for example 1 an identity attribute trust level e.g. what is the system s confidence level in the set of user identifying attributes such as phone number e mail address street address social security number SSN to establish an individual s identity also referred to as identity assurance level 2 a device trust level in which system may gather certain identifying properties of the access device . For example system may use historic device information about the device to modify the device trust level. For instance if the same user uses the same device regularly system may increase trust or conversely if the device has been involved in fraudulent or suspicious activity the trust level may be reduced or 3 authentication claim trust level e.g. what is the system s confidence in the secret information such as simple user name password two factor authentication 2FA biometric identification or other mechanisms provided to the system at the time of authentication also referred to as authentication confidence level.

The authorization services in processing response or in the alternative example authentication services in processing response also may incorporate for example a role based access control model and policies e.g. based on a set of roles the system gives users within each specific role a set of capabilities to act on certain resources in the system .

The authorization services in processing response or in the alternative example authentication services in processing response also may incorporate for example an attribute based access control model and policies e.g. based on various attributes associated with a user of the system the system determines the user s capabilities based on the value of the various attributes .

The authorization services in processing response or in the alternative example authentication services in processing response also may incorporate for example a risk based access control e.g. based on the basic privilege determination by the role based access control and attribute based access control the system may add additional decisions around access granting based on the confidence level of system in both the identity and authentication mechanism used . In some situations for example the result of the additional risk based decision may be that additional user action needs to be taken prior to granting access. These additional actions may include establishing more identity trust by providing more information about the subject e.g. SSN tax business information or other identifying factors or by presenting more security claims e.g. using 2FA answering security questions in addition to basic login and password or responding to challenges around existing attributes known to the system such as last four digits of SSN .

In a request process a subject who may be authentic or an imposter may request access to system by submitting claims . Claims may be processed by an authentication process which may be executed for example by authentication services shown in . Authentication process may provide specific attributes from the claims to process for example for further processing by RABAC process . Authentication process also may provide an authentication confidence level e.g. confidence in an identity matching its user or in the specific case confidence in the claims being made by an authentic subject from the claims to process for example for further processing by identity assurance and authentication confidence process . Identity assurance and authentication confidence process may provide input to role process which may for example provide further input regarding roles assigned to subject to RABAC process .

For example if the transaction requested by a subject is the purchase of digital goods less than 5 in amount the RABAC process may make a decision based on the following criteria 1 is the identity assurance level 50 e.g. output of process expressed as a confidence or probability level 2 is the authentication confidence level 70 e.g. output of process 3 is the machine identity device trust level 60 e.g. output of process 4 is the zip code street number or other address attribute provided e.g. output of process . If a yes answer is given to 1 through 4 access may be granted by service provider system to allow the transaction.

For another example if the transaction requested by the subject is to send money to some recipient the amount being in excess of 2 000 000 in amount the RABAC process may make a decision based on the following criteria 1 is the identity assurance level 70 2 is the bank account number on file e.g. in the user information database 3 is the customer subject 2FA authenticated e.g. authentication confidence level corresponds to 2FA authentication 4 is the authentication confidence level of the request whether based on machine identity credential or other 80 . If a yes answer is given to 1 through 4 access may be granted by service provider system to allow the transaction.

Sequence steps through may be summarized as a process of verifying claims issuing the authentication token and continuing the process at the authorization system e.g. authorization services or RABAC process .

At sequence step . of step a subject e.g. customer may enter the subject s credential or credentials into the access device to be sent to the service provider front end e.g. server application . Step . may be optional if credentials are available from step . At sequence step . claims e.g. credentials device or other attributes may be sent to an authentication sub system e.g. authentication services . The authentication sub system may have calibrated authentication levels that may be specified in the RABAC model e.g. programming of RABAC process . At sequence step the authentication sub system may communicate with a risk sub system e.g. risks services to get data and session and identity scores. At sequence step based on the specific attributes for identity and authentication and using a risk evaluation from the risk sub system an authentication confidence level is created e.g. initial calculation is performed by the authentication sub system. At sequence step the authentication sub system may generate a security assertion markup language SAML or session token e.g. token shown in based on both the authentication confidence level and the attribute e.g. subject or device attribute action attribute resource attribute or environment attribute for example matched. An authentication context may optionally be sent as shown in with token . At sequence step the service provider front end e.g. server application may transfer control or execution or communicate with an authorization engine e.g. authorization services . At sequence step the authorization engine may communicate with the risk sub system to find out if the operation e.g. action requested to be performed by the subject with access device using the resource requested with environment attribute present can be allowed. At sequence step if the risk sub system provides a negative risk evaluation the risk sub system may inform the authorization engine not to allow the operation. On the other hand if the risk sub system provides a positive risk evaluation the risk sub system may inform the authorization engine to allow the operation and the sequence flow may jump past sequence step to continue with the operation and allowing access to the system e.g. system via the access device e.g. device .

Sequence steps through may be summarized as a process of optional step up authentication in the event that an attempt at access has failed.

At sequence step the authorization engine may inform the service provider front end e.g. server application the operation is not allowed. At sequence step the service provider front end may communicate with the access device for example prompting the subject e.g. user or customer to retry or to enter additional information such as additional credentials or claims. At sequence step for example the customer may enter additional information such as the last four digits of a credit card number. At sequence step the additional information may be sent to an appropriate domain or service that verifies if the additional information is on file or not. At sequence step verification results may be sent back to the service provider front end. At sequence step the new request may be sent to the authorization engine which may consult with the risk sub system in sequence step to find out if the operation can be allowed. At sequence step the risk sub system may provide either a negative risk evaluation or a positive risk evaluation as before. At sequence step the authorization engine may send the request to the authentication sub system e.g. authentication services to generate a new token e.g. a new token as seen in at a new level. At sequence step the new token may be returned back to the authorization engine via the service provider front end e.g. server application from the authentication subsystem. At sequence steps the authorization engine may inform the service provider front end e.g. server application and the user via the access device whether or not the operation is allowed. If not allowed additional step authorizations may be attempted or access may be denied. If allowed as with sequence step the sequence flow may jump past sequence step to continue with the operation and allowing access to the system e.g. system via the access device e.g. device .
