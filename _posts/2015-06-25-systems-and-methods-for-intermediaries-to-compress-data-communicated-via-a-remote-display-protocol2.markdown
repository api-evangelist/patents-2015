This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 709 172 titled Systems and Methods for Intermediaries to Compress Data Communicated Via a Remote Display Protocol and filed on Feb. 19 2010 which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 154 120 titled Systems and Methods for Intermediaries To Compress Data Communicated Via a Remote Display Protocol and filed on Feb. 20 2009 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present application generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods to improve effectiveness of compression of intermediaries to compress data transmitted via a remote display protocol.

In a server based computing environment a server may communicate to a client changes in output of an application running on the server. The server may communicate these changes via a remote display protocol. In some cases the server communicates graphical or drawing commands via the remote display protocol. For example the server may communicate changes in the display caused by the application as a series of commands to draw the changes on the screen of the client. The server may send commands to the client to draw identified glyphs or bitmaps on the screen of the client. In this manner instead of transmitting the entire output of the server application to the client the server sends only the portions of the display that changed via a series of drawing commands.

As the client receives drawing commands and data to be drawn the client may cache such data for future drawing commands. The server may provide a cache handle for such data to reference the data stored in the cache instead of retransmitting the data on subsequent drawing commands. For example the server may send via the remote display protocol a command to draw a bitmap. The command may identify the draw command and use the cache handle to identify the bitmap to draw. When the client receives the draw command it uses the corresponding cache handle to retrieve the bitmap to draw from its cache.

The server may use an arbitrary cache handle generation scheme. As a drawing command and or bitmap for the drawing command is generated the server may assign a unique cache identifier. For example the server may use a sequential counter to simply assign the next bitmap to be cached the next available identifier. For different sessions between a server and multiple clients the caches may not only include different bitmaps but the server may have generated different cache handles for the same bitmap.

The present solution is directed towards changes in the remote display protocol to improve efficiencies of compression performed by one or more intermediaries between the server and a plurality of clients. In an example deployment a plurality of servers may provide applications to a plurality of clients over a Wide Area Network WAN . One or more WAN acceleration intermediaries such as WAN appliances or appliances may be deployed between the servers such as servers and the clients such as clients . For example one WAN appliance may be deployed on a private network of an enterprise at a data center providing the servers. This WAN appliance may connect or be in line to the connection of the servers from the private network of the data center to the WAN or public network. A second WAN appliance may be deployed inline on the client side local area network LAN from the clients LAN to the WAN or public network. These WAN appliances may share a compression history and communicate compressed data to improve the bandwidth and performance of communications between the servers and the clients.

The servers may provide remote based computing to the plurality of client by executing applications on the servers on behalf of the clients. The servers may transmit via remote display protocol to the clients changes in the output of an application executing on the servers. The WAN based intermediaries such as appliances may intercept such communications and perform compression on the data. In the case of versions of remote display protocol that do not provide cache handles and content that are more repeatable across multiple client sessions the WAN accelerators may not accelerate such remote display protocol data as desired. In some cases these remote display protocols may use different cache handles for the same bitmaps or glyphs across sessions. For example the server communicates a first bitmap with a first handle to a first client and for a second client the server communicates the first bitmap with a second handle that is different than the first. With the different cache handles for the same bitmap content the compression histories of the WAN accelerations do not have as much repeatable and compressible data if the cache handles were the same across sessions.

In one aspect the present solution automatically detects the remote display protocol capabilities of the client server and or intermediaries to determine whether the client and server should compress the remote display protocol data or the intermediaries and in some cases both.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method for determining to have intermediaries perform compression of a remote display protocol communicated between a client and a server the method comprising. The method may include transmitting by a client to a server via a first intermediary and a second intermediary a communication identifying remote display protocol capabilities of the client. The server may determine from the communication forwarded via the first intermediary and the second intermediary the remote display protocol capabilities of the client and the first intermediary and or the second intermediary. The server may transmit to the client responsive to the determination a second communication identifying that the client and server are not to perform compression on remote display protocol communications. In these embodiments the intermediaries perform the compression. The first intermediary may perform compress data communicated by the server to the client via the remote display protocol and forwarding the compressed data to the second intermediary. The second intermediary may uncompress the compressed data and forwarding the uncompressed data to the client via the remote display protocol.

In some embodiments the server may initiate a handshake transaction of the remote display protocol to negotiate capabilities between the client and the server. The client may identify via the communication a version of the remote display protocol supported by the client. The first intermediary and the second intermediary may each modify the communication to identify a version of the remote display protocol they each support. The server may transmit to the client the second communication as part of a handshake transaction of the remote display protocol to negotiate capabilities between the client and the server.

The first intermediary may receive a first frame of data via a first session of the remote display protocol between the client and the server and store portions of the first frame to a first compression history. The second intermediary may receive the first frame forwarded by the first intermediary and store portions of the first frame to a second compression history. Content of the first compression history is shared by the second compression history. The first intermediary may receive via a second session of the remote display protocol a second frame of data and compress portions of data of the second frame of the second session using portions of data the first frame of the first session stored in the first compression history. The first intermediary connected to a first network of the client may communicate the compressed data via a second protocol different than the remote display protocol to the second intermediary connected to a second network of the client.

In another aspect the present invention is related to a method for determining to have intermediaries perform compression of a remote display protocol communicated between a client and a server. The method may include transmitting by a server to a client via a first intermediary and a second intermediary a communication identifying remote display protocol capabilities of the client. The client may determine from the communication forwarded via the first intermediary and the second intermediary the remote display protocol capabilities of the server and one of the first intermediary and or the second intermediary. The client may transmit to the server responsive to the determination a second communication identifying that the client and server are not to perform compression on remote display protocol communications. In these embodiments the intermediaries may perform compression on the remote display protocol instead of the client and the server. The first intermediary may compress data communicated by the server to the client via the remote display protocol and forwarding the compressed data to the second intermediary. The second intermediary may uncompressed the compressed data and forward the uncompressed data to the client via the remote display protocol.

In some embodiments the client initiates via the communication a handshake transaction of the remote display protocol to negotiate capabilities between the client and the server. The server may identify via the communication a version of the remote display protocol supported by the server. The first intermediary and or second intermediary may modify the communication to identify a version of the remote display protocol supported by the intermediary respectively. The client may transmit to the server the second communication as part of a handshake transaction of the remote display protocol to negotiate capabilities between the client and the server.

In some aspects the present solution uses a content based handle generation scheme referred to as a universal handle to generate the same cache handle for content such as bitmaps across remote display protocol sessions. For example the server may apply a predetermined hash or algorithm on the content of the bitmap. In this manner the same bitmaps will have the same handles. However the remote display protocol may support a predetermined number of bits to represent and store the cache handle. For example 2 bytes or 16 bits may be allocated for the value of the cache handle. With a limited number of bits and the large number of glyphs or bitmaps used by the remote display protocol the content based scheme for the handles will cause collisions. That is with a 16 bit handle a first bitmap and second bitmap may have the same generated handle although the bitmaps are different. So although the content based handle generation helps improve compression effectiveness of the WAN accelerators it hinders the remote display protocol mechanism in distinguishing between bitmaps based on the handle.

In the present solution the remote display protocol includes a disambiguation capability to maintain the improved repeatability of compressible content across remote display sessions and clients while allowing the client to distinguish between bitmaps having the same handles. As the server understands the bitmaps for which the server generates handles the server can provide a disambiguation vector or record to the client. The remote display protocol may include the disambiguation record in any portion of the frame or headers. The client may use the disambiguation record to distinguish between handles that are the same but represent different bitmaps.

With the modification to the remote display protocol to support both a universal content handle UCH and disambiguation the WAN intermediaries may provide better compression performance while maintaining the operations of server and the client to display the appropriate changes to the remote display of the client. The support in the remote display protocol for a disambiguation records increases the overhead of the protocol. However the increase in compressible data that may occur across multiple sessions and multiple clients in a deployment overcomes this overhead with improved compression over the WAN link between the clients and the servers.

The data objects or content processed and stored by the cache manager may include data in any format such as a markup language or any type of data communicated via any protocol. In some embodiments the cache manager duplicates original data stored elsewhere or data previously computed generated or transmitted in which the original data may require longer access time to fetch compute or otherwise obtain relative to reading a cache memory or storage element. Once the data is stored in the cache future use can be made by accessing the cached copy rather than refetching or recomputing the original data thereby reducing the access time.

In one embodiment the compression engine applies context insensitive compression which is compression applied to data without knowledge of the type of data. In another embodiment the compression engine applies context sensitive compression. In this embodiment the compression engine utilizes knowledge of the data type to select a specific compression algorithm from a suite of suitable algorithms. In some embodiments knowledge of the specific protocol is used to perform context sensitive compression. In one embodiment the appliance or compression engine can use port numbers e.g. well known ports as well as data from the connection itself to determine the appropriate compression algorithm to use. Some protocols use only a single type of data requiring only a single compression algorithm that can be selected when the connection is established.

The compression engine may first use the cache based data to determine one or more data matches for compression and then may check the memory based data to determine one or more data matches for compression. In another case the compression engine may check disk storage for data matches for compression after checking either the cache based and or memory based data history.

In one embodiment multi protocol compression engine compresses bi directionally between clients and servers any TCP IP based protocol including Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI email File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Common Internet File System CIFS protocol file transfer Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol Remote Desktop Protocol RDP Wireless Application Protocol WAP Mobile IP protocol and Voice Over IP VoIP protocol.

The LAN WAN detector includes any logic business rules function or operations for automatically detecting a slow side connection e.g. a wide area network WAN connection such as an Intranet and associated port and a fast side connection e.g. a local area network LAN connection and an associated port . In some embodiments the LAN WAN detector monitors network traffic on the network ports of the appliance to detect a synchronization packet sometimes referred to as a tagged network packet. The synchronization packet identifies a type or speed of the network traffic. In one embodiment the synchronization packet identifies a WAN speed or WAN type connection. The LAN WAN detector also identifies receipt of an acknowledgement packet to a tagged synchronization packet and on which port it is received. The appliance then configures itself to operate the identified port on which the tagged synchronization packet arrived so that the speed on that port is set to be the speed associated with the network connected to that port. The other port is then set to the speed associated with the network connected to that port.

For ease of discussion herein reference to fast side will be made with respect to connection with a wide area network WAN e.g. the Internet and operating at a network speed of the WAN. Likewise reference to slow side will be made with respect to connection with a local area network LAN and operating at a network speed the LAN. However it is noted that fast and slow sides in a network can change on a per connection basis and are relative terms to the speed of the network connections or to the type of network topology. Such configurations are useful in complex network topologies where a network is fast or slow only when compared to adjacent networks and not in any absolute sense.

In one embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to allow for auto discovery by an appliance of a network to which it connects. In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector may be used to detect the existence or presence of a second appliance deployed in the network . For example an auto discovery mechanism in operation in accordance with functions as follows appliance and are placed in line with the connection linking client and server . The appliances and are at the ends of a low speed link e.g. Internet connecting two LANs. In one example embodiment appliances and each include two ports one to connect with the lower speed link and the other to connect with a higher speed link e.g. a LAN. Any packet arriving at one port is copied to the other port. Thus appliance and are each configured to function as a bridge between the two networks .

When an end node such as the client opens a new TCP connection with another end node such as the server the client sends a TCP packet with a synchronization SYN header bit set or a SYN packet to the server . In the present example client opens a transport layer connection to server . When the SYN packet passes through appliance the appliance inserts attaches or otherwise provides a characteristic TCP header option to the packet which announces its presence. If the packet passes through a second appliance in this example appliance the second appliance notes the header option on the SYN packet. The server responds to the SYN packet with a synchronization acknowledgment SYN ACK packet. When the SYN ACK packet passes through appliance a TCP header option is tagged e.g. attached inserted or added to the SYN ACK packet to announce appliance presence to appliance . When appliance receives this packet both appliances are now aware of each other and the connection can be appropriately accelerated.

Further to the operations of the LAN WAN detector a method or process for detecting fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN packet is described. During a transport layer connection establishment between a client and a server the appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configure the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The appliance then tags the SYN packet with an ACK and copies the packet to the other port.

In another embodiment the LAN WAN detector detects fast and slow sides of a network using a SYN ACK packet. The appliance via the LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN ACK packet is tagged with an acknowledgement ACK . If it is tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the tagged SYN packet SYN ACK as the slow side. In one embodiment the appliance optionally removes the ACK tag from the packet before copying the packet to the other port. If the LAN WAN detector determines that the packet is not tagged the appliance identifies or configures the port receiving the untagged packet as the fast side. The LAN WAN detector determines whether the SYN packet was tagged. If the SYN packet was not tagged the appliance copied the packet to the other port. If the SYN packet was tagged the appliance tags the SYN ACK packet before copying it to the other port.

The appliance may add insert modify attach or otherwise provide any information or data in the TCP option header to provide any information data or characteristics about the network connection network traffic flow or the configuration or operation of the appliance . In this manner not only does an appliance announce its presence to another appliance or tag a higher or lower speed connection the appliance provides additional information and data via the TCP option headers about the appliance or the connection. The TCP option header information may be useful to or used by an appliance in controlling managing optimizing acceleration or improving the network traffic flow traversing the appliance or to otherwise configure itself or operation of a network port.

Although generally described in conjunction with detecting speeds of network connections or the presence of appliances the LAN WAN detector can be used for applying any type of function logic or operation of the appliance to a port connection or flow of network traffic. In particular automated assignment of ports can occur whenever a device performs different functions on different ports where the assignment of a port to a task can be made during the unit s operation and or the nature of the network segment on each port is discoverable by the appliance .

The flow controller includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of transport layer communications of network packets or the delivery of packets at the transport layer. A flow controller also sometimes referred to as a flow control module regulates manages and controls data transfer rates. In some embodiments the flow controller is deployed at or connected at a bandwidth bottleneck in the network . In one embodiment the flow controller effectively regulates manages and controls bandwidth usage or utilization. In other embodiments the flow control modules may also be deployed at points on the network of latency transitions low latency to high latency and on links with media losses such as wireless or satellite links .

In some embodiments a flow controller may include a receiver side flow control module for controlling the rate of receipt of network transmissions and a sender side flow control module for the controlling the rate of transmissions of network packets. In other embodiments a first flow controller includes a receiver side flow control module and a second flow controller includes a sender side flow control module. In some embodiments a first flow controller is deployed on a first appliance and a second flow controller is deployed on a second appliance . As such in some embodiments a first appliance controls the flow of data on the receiver side and a second appliance controls the data flow from the sender side. In yet another embodiment a single appliance includes flow control for both the receiver side and sender side of network communications traversing the appliance .

In one embodiment a flow control module is configured to allow bandwidth at the bottleneck to be more fully utilized and in some embodiments not overutilized. In some embodiments the flow control module transparently buffers or rebuffers data already buffered by for example the sender network sessions that pass between nodes having associated flow control modules . When a session passes through two or more flow control modules one or more of the flow control modules controls a rate of the session s .

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured with predetermined data relating to bottleneck bandwidth. In another embodiment the flow control module may be configured to detect the bottleneck bandwidth or data associated therewith. Unlike conventional network protocols such as TCP a receiver side flow control module controls the data transmission rate. The receiver side flow control module controls the sender side flow control module e.g. data transmission rate by forwarding transmission rate limits to the sender side flow control module . In one embodiment the receiver side flow control module piggybacks these transmission rate limits on acknowledgement ACK packets or signals sent to the sender e.g. client by the receiver e.g. server . The receiver side flow control module does this in response to rate control requests that are sent by the sender side flow control module . The requests from the sender side flow control module may be piggybacked on data packets sent by the sender .

In some embodiments the flow controller manipulates adjusts simulates changes improves or otherwise adapts the behavior of the transport layer protocol to provide improved performance or operations of delivery data rates and or bandwidth utilization of the transport layer. The flow controller may implement a plurality of data flow control techniques at the transport layer including but not limited to 1 pre acknowledgements 2 window virtualization 3 recongestion techniques 3 local retransmission techniques 4 wavefront detection and disambiguation 5 transport control protocol selective acknowledgements 6 transaction boundary detection techniques and 7 repacketization.

Although a sender may be generally described herein as a client and a receiver as a server a sender may be any end point such as a server or any computing device on the network . Likewise a receiver may be a client or any other computing device on the network .

In brief overview of a pre acknowledgement flow control technique the flow controller in some embodiments handles the acknowledgements and retransmits for a sender effectively terminating the sender s connection with the downstream portion of a network connection. In reference to one possible deployment of an appliance into a network architecture to implement this feature is depicted. In this example environment a sending computer or client transmits data on network for example via a switch which determines that the data is destined for VPN appliance . Because of the chosen network topology all data destined for VPN appliance traverses appliance so the appliance can apply any necessary algorithms to this data.

Continuing further with the example the client transmits a packet which is received by the appliance . When the appliance receives the packet which is transmitted from the client to a recipient via the VPN appliance the appliance retains a copy of the packet and forwards the packet downstream to the VPN appliance . The appliance then generates an acknowledgement packet ACK and sends the ACK packet back to the client or sending endpoint. This ACK a pre acknowledgment causes the sender to believe that the packet has been delivered successfully freeing the sender s resources for subsequent processing. The appliance retains the copy of the packet data in the event that a retransmission of the packet is required so that the sender does not have to handle retransmissions of the data. This early generation of acknowledgements may be called preacking. 

If a retransmission of the packet is required the appliance retransmits the packet to the sender. The appliance may determine whether retransmission is required as a sender would in a traditional system for example determining that a packet is lost if an acknowledgement has not been received for the packet after a predetermined amount of time. To this end the appliance monitors acknowledgements generated by the receiving endpoint e.g. server or any other downstream network entity so that it can determine whether the packet has been successfully delivered or needs to be retransmitted. If the appliance determines that the packet has been successfully delivered the appliance is free to discard the saved packet data. The appliance may also inhibit forwarding acknowledgements for packets that have already been received by the sending endpoint.

In the embodiment described above the appliance via the flow controller controls the sender through the delivery of pre acknowledgements also referred to as preacks as though the appliance was a receiving endpoint itself. Since the appliance is not an endpoint and does not actually consume the data the appliance includes a mechanism for providing overflow control to the sending endpoint. Without overflow control the appliance could run out of memory because the appliance stores packets that have been preacked to the sending endpoint but not yet acknowledged as received by the receiving endpoint. Therefore in a situation in which the sender transmits packets to the appliance faster than the appliance can forward the packets downstream the memory available in the appliance to store unacknowledged packet data can quickly fill. A mechanism for overflow control allows the appliance to control transmission of the packets from the sender to avoid this problem.

In one embodiment the appliance or flow controller includes an inherent self clocking overflow control mechanism. This self clocking is due to the order in which the appliance may be designed to transmit packets downstream and send ACKs to the sender or . In some embodiments the appliance does not preack the packet until after it transmits the packet downstream. In this way the sender will receive the ACKs at the rate at which the appliance is able to transmit packets rather than the rate at which the appliance receives packets from the sender . This helps to regulate the transmission of packets from a sender .

Another overflow control mechanism that the appliance may implement is to use the TCP window size parameter which tells a sender how much buffer the receiver is permitting the sender to fill up. A nonzero window size e.g. a size of at least one Maximum Segment Size MSS in a preack permits the sending endpoint to continue to deliver data to the appliance whereas a zero window size inhibits further data transmission. Accordingly the appliance may regulate the flow of packets from the sender for example when the appliance s buffer is becoming full by appropriately setting the TCP window size in each preack.

Another technique to reduce this additional overhead is to apply hysteresis. When the appliance delivers data to the slower side the overflow control mechanism in the appliance can require that a minimum amount of space be available before sending a nonzero window advertisement to the sender. In one embodiment the appliance waits until there is a minimum of a predetermined number of packets such as four packets of space available before sending a nonzero window packet such as a window size of four packet . This reduces the overhead by approximately a factor four since only two ACK packets are sent for each group of four data packets instead of eight ACK packets for four data packets.

Another technique the appliance or flow controller may use for overflow control is the TCP delayed ACK mechanism which skips ACKs to reduce network traffic. The TCP delayed ACKs automatically delay the sending of an ACK either until two packets are received or until a fixed timeout has occurred. This mechanism alone can result in cutting the overhead in half moreover by increasing the numbers of packets above two additional overhead reduction is realized. But merely delaying the ACK itself may be insufficient to control overflow and the appliance may also use the advertised window mechanism on the ACKs to control the sender. When doing this the appliance in one embodiment avoids triggering the timeout mechanism of the sender by delaying the ACK too long.

In one embodiment the flow controller does not preack the last packet of a group of packets. By not preacking the last packet or at least one of the packets in the group the appliance avoids a false acknowledgement for a group of packets. For example if the appliance were to send a preack for a last packet and the packet were subsequently lost the sender would have been tricked into thinking that the packet is delivered when it was not. Thinking that the packet had been delivered the sender could discard that data. If the appliance also lost the packet there would be no way to retransmit the packet to the recipient. By not preacking the last packet of a group of packets the sender will not discard the packet until it has been delivered.

In another embodiment the flow controller may use a window virtualization technique to control the rate of flow or bandwidth utilization of a network connection. Though it may not immediately be apparent from examining conventional literature such as RFC 1323 there is effectively a send window for transport layer protocols such as TCP. The send window is similar to the receive window in that it consumes buffer space though on the sender . The sender s send window consists of all data sent by the application that has not been acknowledged by the receiver. This data must be retained in memory in case retransmission is required. Since memory is a shared resource some TCP stack implementations limit the size of this data. When the send window is full an attempt by an application program to send more data results in blocking the application program until space is available. Subsequent reception of acknowledgements will free send window memory and unblock the application program. In some embodiments this window size is known as the socket buffer size in some TCP implementations.

In one embodiment the flow control module is configured to provide access to increased window or buffer sizes. This configuration may also be referenced to as window virtualization. In the embodiment of TCP as the transport layer protocol the TCP header includes a bit string corresponding to a window scale. In one embodiment window may be referenced in a context of send receive or both.

One embodiment of window virtualization is to insert a preacking appliance into a TCP session. In reference to any of the environments of or initiation of a data communication session between a source node e.g. client for ease of discussion now referenced as source node and a destination node e.g. server for ease of discussion now referenced as destination node is established. For TCP communications the source node initially transmits a synchronization signal SYN through its local area network to first flow control module . The first flow control module inserts a configuration identifier into the TCP header options area. The configuration identifier identifies this point in the data path as a flow control module.

The appliances via a flow control module provide window or buffer to allow increasing data buffering capabilities within a session despite having end nodes with small buffer sizes e.g. typically 16 k bytes. However RFC 1323 requires window scaling for any buffer sizes greater than 64 k bytes which must be set at the time of session initialization SYN SYN ACK signals . Moreover the window scaling corresponds to the lowest common denominator in the data path often an end node with small buffer size. This window scale often is a scale of 0 or 1 which corresponds to a buffer size of up to 64 k or 128 k bytes. Note that because the window size is defined as the window field in each packet shifted over by the window scale the window scale establishes an upper limit for the buffer but does not guarantee the buffer is actually that large. Each packet indicates the current available buffer space at the receiver in the window field.

In one embodiment of scaling using the window virtualization technique during connection establishment i.e. initialization of a session when the first flow control module receives from the source node the SYN signal or packet the flow control module stores the windows scale of the source node which is the previous node or stores a 0 for window scale if the scale of the previous node is missing. The first flow control module also modifies the scale e.g. increases the scale to 4 from 0 or 1 in the SYN FCM signal. When the second flow control module receives the SYN signal it stores the increased scale from the first flow control signal and resets the scale in the SYN signal back to the source node scale value for transmission to the destination node . When the second flow controller receives the SYN ACK signal from the destination node it stores the scale from the destination node scale e.g. 0 or 1 and modifies it to an increased scale that is sent with the SYN ACK FCM signal. The first flow control node receives and notes the received window scale and revises the windows scale sent back to the source node back down to the original scale e.g. 0 or 1. Based on the above window shift conversation during connection establishment the window field in every subsequent packet e.g. TCP packet of the session must be shifted according to the window shift conversion.

The window scale as described above expresses buffer sizes of over 64 k and may not be required for window virtualization. Thus shifts for window scale may be used to express increased buffer capacity in each flow control module . This increase in buffer capacity in may be referenced as window or buffer virtualization. The increase in buffer size allows greater packet through put from and to the respective end nodes and . Note that buffer sizes in TCP are typically expressed in terms of bytes but for ease of discussion packets may be used in the description herein as it relates to virtualization.

By way of example a window or buffer virtualization performed by the flow controller is described. In this example the source node and the destination node are configured similar to conventional end nodes having a limited buffer capacity of 16 k bytes which equals approximately 10 packets of data. Typically an end node must wait until the packet is transmitted and confirmation is received before a next group of packets can be transmitted. In one embodiment using increased buffer capacity in the flow control modules when the source node transmits its data packets the first flow control module receives the packets stores it in its larger capacity buffer e.g. 512 packet capacity and immediately sends back an acknowledgement signal indicating receipt of the packets REC ACK back to the source node . The source node can then flush its current buffer load it with 10 new data packets and transmit those onto the first flow control module . Again the first flow control module transmits a REC ACK signal back to the source node and the source node flushes its buffer and loads it with 10 more new packets for transmission.

As the first flow control module receives the data packets from the source nodes it loads up its buffer accordingly. When it is ready the first flow control module can begin transmitting the data packets to the second flow control module which also has an increased buffer size for example to receive 512 packets. The second flow control module receives the data packets and begins to transmit 10 packets at a time to the destination node . Each REC ACK received at the second flow control node from the destination node results in 10 more packets being transmitted to the destination node until all the data packets are transferred. Hence the present invention is able to increase data transmission throughput between the source node sender and the destination node receiver by taking advantage of the larger buffer in the flow control modules between the devices.

It is noted that by preacking the transmission of data as described previously a sender or source node is allowed to transmit more data than is possible without the preacks thus affecting a larger window size. For example in one embodiment this technique is effective when the flow control module is located near a node e.g. source node or destination node that lacks large windows.

Another technique or algorithm of the flow controller is referred to as recongestion. The standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithms are known to perform poorly in the face of certain network conditions including large RTTs round trip times high packet loss rates and others. When the appliance detects a congestion condition such as long round trip times or high packet loss the appliance intervenes substituting an alternate congestion avoidance algorithm that better suits the particular network condition. In one embodiment the recongestion algorithm uses preacks to effectively terminate the connection between the sender and the receiver. The appliance then resends the packets from itself to the receiver using a different congestion avoidance algorithm. Recongestion algorithms may be dependent on the characteristics of the TCP connection. The appliance monitors each TCP connection characterizing it with respect to the different dimensions selecting a recongestion algorithm that is appropriate for the current characterization.

In one embodiment upon detecting a TCP connection that is limited by round trip times RTT a recongestion algorithm is applied which behaves as multiple TCP connections. Each TCP connection operates within its own performance limit but the aggregate bandwidth achieves a higher performance level. One parameter in this mechanism is the number of parallel connections that are applied N . Too large a value of N and the connection bundle achieves more than its fair share of bandwidth. Too small a value of N and the connection bundle achieves less than its fair share of bandwidth. One method of establishing N relies on the appliance monitoring the packet loss rate RTT and packet size of the actual connection. These numbers are plugged into a TCP response curve formula to provide an upper limit on the performance of a single TCP connection in the present configuration. If each connection within the connection bundle is achieving substantially the same performance as that computed to be the upper limit then additional parallel connections are applied. If the current bundle is achieving less performance than the upper limit the number of parallel connections is reduced. In this manner the overall fairness of the system is maintained since individual connection bundles contain no more parallelism than is required to eliminate the restrictions imposed by the protocol itself. Furthermore each individual connection retains TCP compliance.

Another method of establishing N is to utilize a parallel flow control algorithm such as the TCP Vegas algorithm or its improved version Stabilized Vegas. In this method the network information associated with the connections in the connection bundle e.g. RTT loss rate average packet size etc. is aggregated and applied to the alternate flow control algorithm. The results of this algorithm are in turn distributed among the connections of the bundle controlling their number i.e. N . Optionally each connection within the bundle continues using the standard TCP congestion avoidance algorithm.

In another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are virtualized i.e. actual individual TCP connections are not established. Instead the congestion avoidance algorithm is modified to behave as though there were N parallel connections. This method has the advantage of appearing to transiting network nodes as a single connection. Thus the QOS security and other monitoring methods of these nodes are unaffected by the recongestion algorithm. In yet another embodiment the individual connections within a parallel bundle are real i.e. a separate. TCP connection is established for each of the parallel connections within a bundle. The congestion avoidance algorithm for each TCP connection need not be modified.

In some embodiments the flow controller may apply a local retransmission technique. One reason for implementing preacks is to prepare to transit a high loss link e.g. wireless . In these embodiments the preacking appliance or flow control module is located most beneficially before the wireless link. This allows retransmissions to be performed closer to the high loss link removing the retransmission burden from the remainder of the network. The appliance may provide local retransmission in which case packets dropped due to failures of the link are retransmitted directly by the appliance . This is advantageous because it eliminates the retransmission burden upon an end node such as server and infrastructure of any of the networks . With appliance providing local retransmissions the dropped packet can be retransmitted across the high loss link without necessitating a retransmit by an end node and a corresponding decrease in the rate of data transmission from the end node.

Another reason for implementing preacks is to avoid a receive time out RTO penalty. In standard TCP there are many situations that result in an RTO even though a large percentage of the packets in flight were successfully received. With standard TCP algorithms dropping more than one packet within an RTT window would likely result in a timeout. Additionally most TCP connections experience a timeout if a retransmitted packet is dropped. In a network with a high bandwidth delay product even a relatively small packet loss rate will cause frequent Retransmission timeouts RTOs . In one embodiment the appliance uses a retransmit and timeout algorithm is avoid premature RTOs. The appliance or flow controller maintains a count of retransmissions is maintained on a per packet basis. Each time that a packet is retransmitted the count is incremented by one and the appliance continues to transmit packets. In some embodiments only if a packet has been retransmitted a predetermined number of times is an RTO declared.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller uses wavefront detection and disambiguation techniques in managing and controlling flow of network traffic. In this technique the flow controller uses transmit identifiers or numbers to determine whether particular data packets need to be retransmitted. By way of example a sender transmits data packets over a network where each instance of a transmitted data packet is associated with a transmit number. It can be appreciated that the transmit number for a packet is not the same as the packet s sequence number since a sequence number references the data in the packet while the transmit number references an instance of a transmission of that data. The transmit number can be any information usable for this purpose including a timestamp associated with a packet or simply an increasing number similar to a sequence number or a packet number . Because a data segment may be retransmitted different transmit numbers may be associated with a particular sequence number.

As the sender transmits data packets the sender maintains a data structure of acknowledged instances of data packet transmissions. Each instance of a data packet transmission is referenced by its sequence number and transmit number. By maintaining a transmit number for each packet the sender retains the ordering of the transmission of data packets. When the sender receives an ACK or a SACK the sender determines the highest transmit number associated with packets that the receiver indicated has arrived in the received acknowledgement . Any outstanding unacknowledged packets with lower transmit numbers are presumed lost.

In some embodiments the sender is presented with an ambiguous situation when the arriving packet has been retransmitted a standard ACK SACK does not contain enough information to allow the sender to determine which transmission of the arriving packet has triggered the acknowledgement. After receiving an ambiguous acknowledgement therefore the sender disambiguates the acknowledgement to associate it with a transmit number. In various embodiments one or a combination of several techniques may be used to resolve this ambiguity.

In one embodiment the sender includes an identifier with a transmitted data packet and the receiver returns that identifier or a function thereof with the acknowledgement. The identifier may be a timestamp e.g. a TCP timestamp as described in RFC 1323 a sequential number or any other information that can be used to resolve between two or more instances of a packet s transmission. In an embodiment in which the TCP timestamp option is used to disambiguate the acknowledgement each packet is tagged with up to 32 bits of unique information. Upon receipt of the data packet the receiver echoes this unique information back to the sender with the acknowledgement. The sender ensures that the originally sent packet and its retransmitted version or versions contain different values for the timestamp option allowing it to unambiguously eliminate the ACK ambiguity. The sender may maintain this unique information for example in the data structure in which it stores the status of sent data packets. This technique is advantageous because it complies with industry standards and is thus likely to encounter little or no interoperability issues. However this technique may require ten bytes of TCP header space in some implementations reducing the effective throughput rate on the network and reducing space available for other TCP options.

In another embodiment another field in the packet such as the IP ID field is used to disambiguate in a way similar to the TCP timestamp option described above. The sender arranges for the ID field values of the original and the retransmitted version or versions of the packet to have different ID fields in the IP header. Upon reception of the data packet at the receiver or a proxy device thereof the receiver sets the ID field of the ACK packet to a function of the ID field of the packet that triggers the ACK. This method is advantageous as it requires no additional data to be sent preserving the efficiency of the network and TCP header space. The function chosen should provide a high degree of likelihood of providing disambiguation. In a preferred embodiment the sender selects IP ID values with the most significant bit set to 0. When the receiver responds the IP ID value is set to the same IP ID value with the most significant bit set to a one.

In another embodiment the transmit numbers associated with non ambiguous acknowledgements are used to disambiguate an ambiguous acknowledgement. This technique is based on the principle that acknowledgements for two packets will tend to be received closer in time as the packets are transmitted closer in time. Packets that are not retransmitted will not result in ambiguity as the acknowledgements received for such packets can be readily associated with a transmit number. Therefore these known transmit numbers are compared to the possible transmit numbers for an ambiguous acknowledgement received near in time to the known acknowledgement. The sender compares the transmit numbers of the ambiguous acknowledgement against the last known received transmit number selecting the one closest to the known received transmit number. For example if an acknowledgement for data packet is received and the last received acknowledgement was for data packet the sender resolves the ambiguity by assuming that the third instance of data packet caused the acknowledgement.

Another technique of the appliance or flow controller is to implement an embodiment of transport control protocol selective acknowledgements or TCP SACK to determine what packets have or have not been received. This technique allows the sender to determine unambiguously a list of packets that have been received by the receiver as well as an accurate list of packets not received. This functionality may be implemented by modifying the sender and or receiver or by inserting sender and receiver side flow control modules in the network path between the sender and receiver. In reference to or a sender e.g. client is configured to transmit data packets to the receiver e.g. server over the network . In response the receiver returns a TCP Selective Acknowledgment option referred to as SACK packet to the sender. In one embodiment the communication is bi directional although only one direction of communication is discussed here for simplicity. The receiver maintains a list or other suitable data structure that contains a group of ranges of sequence numbers for data packets that the receiver has actually received. In some embodiments the list is sorted by sequence number in an ascending or descending order. The receiver also maintains a left off pointer which comprises a reference into the list and indicates the left off point from the previously generated SACK packet.

Upon reception of a data packet the receiver generates and transmits a SACK packet back to the sender. In some embodiments the SACK packet includes a number of fields each of which can hold a range of sequence numbers to indicate a set of received data packets. The receiver fills this first field of the SACK packet with a range of sequence numbers that includes the landing packet that triggered the SACK packet. The remaining available SACK fields are filled with ranges of sequence numbers from the list of received packets. As there are more ranges in the list than can be loaded into the SACK packet the receiver uses the left off pointer to determine which ranges are loaded into the SACK packet. The receiver inserts the SACK ranges consecutively from the sorted list starting from the range referenced by the pointer and continuing down the list until the available SACK range space in the TCP header of the SACK packet is consumed. The receiver wraps around to the start of the list if it reaches the end. In some embodiments two or three additional SACK ranges can be added to the SACK range information.

Once the receiver generates the SACK packet the receiver sends the acknowledgement back to the sender. The receiver then advances the left off pointer by one or more SACK range entries in the list. If the receiver inserts four SACK ranges for example the left off pointer may be advanced two SACK ranges in the list. When the advanced left off pointer reaches at the end of the list the pointer is reset to the start of the list effectively wrapping around the list of known received ranges. Wrapping around the list enables the system to perform well even in the presence of large losses of SACK packets since the SACK information that is not communicated due to a lost SACK packet will eventually be communicated once the list is wrapped around.

It can be appreciated therefore that a SACK packet may communicate several details about the condition of the receiver. First the SACK packet indicates that upon generation of the SACK packet the receiver had just received a data packet that is within the first field of the SACK information. Secondly the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information indicate that the receiver has received the data packets within those ranges. The SACK information also implies that the receiver had not at the time of the SACK packet s generation received any of the data packets that fall between the second and subsequent fields of the SACK information. In essence the ranges between the second and subsequent ranges in the SACK information are holes in the received data the data therein known not to have been delivered. Using this method therefore when a SACK packet has sufficient space to include more than two SACK ranges the receiver may indicate to the sender a range of data packets that have not yet been received by the receiver.

In another embodiment the sender uses the SACK packet described above in combination with the retransmit technique described above to make assumptions about which data packets have been delivered to the receiver. For example when the retransmit algorithm using the transmit numbers declares a packet lost the sender considers the packet to be only conditionally lost as it is possible that the SACK packet identifying the reception of this packet was lost rather than the data packet itself. The sender thus adds this packet to a list of potentially lost packets called the presumed lost list. Each time a SACK packet arrives the known missing ranges of data from the SACK packet are compared to the packets in the presumed lost list. Packets that contain data known to be missing are declared actually lost and are subsequently retransmitted. In this way the two schemes are combined to give the sender better information about which packets have been lost and need to be retransmitted.

In some embodiments the appliance or flow controller applies a technique referred to as transaction boundary detection. In one embodiment the technique pertains to ping pong behaved connections. At the TCP layer ping pong behavior is when one communicant a sender sends data and then waits for a response from the other communicant the receiver. Examples of ping pong behavior include remote procedure call HTTP and others. The algorithms described above use retransmission timeout RTO to recover from the dropping of the last packet or packets associated with the transaction. Since the TCP RTO mechanism is extremely coarse in some embodiments for example requiring a minimum one second value in all cases poor application behavior may be seen in these situations.

In one embodiment the sender of data or a flow control module coupled to the sender detects a transaction boundary in the data being sent. Upon detecting a transaction boundary the sender or a flow control module sends additional packets whose reception generates additional ACK or SACK responses from the receiver. Insertion of the additional packets is preferably limited to balance between improved application response time and network capacity utilization. The number of additional packets that is inserted may be selected according to the current loss rate associated with that connection with more packets selected for connections having a higher loss rate.

One method of detecting a transaction boundary is time based. If the sender has been sending data and ceases then after a period of time the sender or flow control module declares a transaction boundary. This may be combined with other techniques. For example the setting of the PSH TCP Push bit by the sender in the TCP header may indicate a transaction boundary. Accordingly combining the time based approach with these additional heuristics can provide for more accurate detection of a transaction boundary. In another technique if the sender or flow control module understands the application protocol it can parse the protocol data stream and directly determine transaction boundaries. In some embodiment this last behavior can be used independent of any time based mechanism.

Responsive to detecting a transaction boundary the sender or flow control module transmits additional data packets to the receiver to cause acknowledgements therefrom. The additional data packets should therefore be such that the receiver will at least generate an ACK or SACK in response to receiving the data packet. In one embodiment the last packet or packets of the transaction are simply retransmitted. This has the added benefit of retransmitting needed data if the last packet or packets had been dropped as compared to merely sending dummy data packets. In another embodiment fractions of the last packet or packets are sent allowing the sender to disambiguate the arrival of these packets from their original packets. This allows the receiver to avoid falsely confusing any reordering adaptation algorithms. In another embodiment any of a number of well known forward error correction techniques can be used to generate additional data for the inserted packets allowing for the reconstruction of dropped or otherwise missing data at the receiver.

In some embodiments the boundary detection technique described herein helps to avoid a timeout when the acknowledgements for the last data packets in a transaction are dropped. When the sender or flow control module receives the acknowledgements for these additional data packets the sender can determine from these additional acknowledgements whether the last data packets have been received or need to be retransmitted thus avoiding a timeout. In one embodiment if the last packets have been received but their acknowledgements were dropped a flow control module generates an acknowledgement for the data packets and sends the acknowledgement to the sender thus communicating to the sender that the data packets have been delivered. In another embodiment if the last packets have not been received a flow control module sends a packet to the sender to cause the sender to retransmit the dropped data packets.

In yet another embodiment the appliance or flow controller applies a repacketization technique for improving the flow of transport layer network traffic. In some embodiments performance of TCP is proportional to packet size. Thus increasing packet sizes improves performance unless it causes substantially increased packet loss rates or other nonlinear effects like IP fragmentation. In general wired media such as copper or fibre optics have extremely low bit error rates low enough that these can be ignored. For these media it is advantageous for the packet size to be the maximum possible before fragmentation occurs the maximum packet size is limited by the protocols of the underlying transmission media . Whereas for transmission media with higher loss rates e.g. wireless technologies such as WiFi etc. or high loss environments such as power line networking etc. increasing the packet size may lead to lower transmission rates as media induced errors cause an entire packet to be dropped i.e. media induced errors beyond the capability of the standard error correcting code for that media increasing the packet loss rate. A sufficiently large increase in the packet loss rate will actually negate any performance benefit of increasing packet size. In some cases it may be difficult for a TCP endpoint to choose an optimal packet size. For example the optimal packet size may vary across the transmission path depending on the nature of each link.

By inserting an appliance or flow control module into the transmission path the flow controller monitors characteristics of the link and repacketizes according to determined link characteristics. In one embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets with sequential data into a smaller number of larger packets. In another embodiment an appliance or flow controller repacketizes packets by breaking part a sequence of large packets into a larger number of smaller packets. In other embodiments an appliance or flow controller monitors the link characteristics and adjusts the packet sizes through recombination to improve throughput.

Still referring to the flow controller in some embodiments may include a QoS Engine also referred to as a QoS controller. In another embodiment the appliance and or network optimization engine includes the QoS engine for example separately but in communication with the flow controller . The QoS Engine includes any logic business rules function or operations for performing one or more Quality of Service QoS techniques improving the performance operation or quality of service of any of the network connections. In some embodiments the QoS engine includes network traffic control and management mechanisms that provide different priorities to different users applications data flows or connections. In other embodiments the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain level of performance to a user application data flow or connection. In one embodiment the QoS engine controls maintains or assures a certain portion of bandwidth or network capacity for a user application data flow or connection. In some embodiments the QoS engine monitors the achieved level of performance or the quality of service corresponding to a user application data flow or connection for example the data rate and delay. In response to monitoring the QoS engine dynamically controls or adjusts scheduling priorities of network packets to achieve the desired level of performance or quality of service.

In some embodiments the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more classes or levels of services. In some embodiments the class or level service may include 1 best efforts 2 controlled load 3 guaranteed or 4 qualitative. For a best efforts class of service the appliance makes reasonable effort to deliver packets a standard service level . For a controlled load class of service the appliance or QoS engine approximates the standard packet error loss of the transmission medium or approximates the behavior of best effort service in lightly loaded network conditions. For a guaranteed class of service the appliance or QoS engine guarantees the ability to transmit data at a determined rate for the duration of the connection. For a qualitative class of service the appliance or QoS engine the qualitative service class is used for applications users data flows or connection that require or desire prioritized traffic but cannot quantify resource needs or level of service. In these cases the appliance or QoS engine determines the class of service or prioritization based on any logic or configuration of the QoS engine or based on business rules or policies. For example in one embodiment the QoS engine prioritizes schedules and transmits network packets according to one or more policies as specified by the policy engine .

The protocol accelerator includes any logic business rules function or operations for optimizing accelerating or otherwise improving the performance operation or quality of service of one or more protocols. In one embodiment the protocol accelerator accelerates any application layer protocol or protocols at layers 5 7 of the network stack. In other embodiments the protocol accelerator accelerates a transport layer or a layer 4 protocol. In one embodiment the protocol accelerator accelerates layer 2 or layer 3 protocols. In some embodiments the protocol accelerator is configured constructed or designed to optimize or accelerate each of one or more protocols according to the type of data characteristics and or behavior of the protocol.

D. Systems and Methods for Compressing Data of a Remote Display Protocol Comprising Disambiguation Capabilities

Referring now to embodiments of systems and methods of intermediaries such as appliances that compress data of a remote display protocol that comprises disambiguation capabilities communicated between a server and a client are illustrated. The remote display protocol may generate a content based handle for bitmaps of glyphs communicated between the server and the client. This handle also referred to as universal content handle UCH may be the same for the same bitmaps across multiple sessions and clients. This provides more repeatable and compressible content in the compression histories of the intermediaries. In some instances UCH may also provide collisions between handles for different bitmaps. For example two different bitmaps may be assigned a same UCH. In order to resolve such a collision the remote display protocol may use a disambiguation capability to distinguish between bitmaps with the same UCH. In this manner the design and construction of the remote display protocol provides improved and accelerated WAN accelerations due to the compressibility of the data while maintaining the integrity and operations of the remote display client agent displaying the desired output.

Referring to an embodiment of a system of clients and a server communicating via a remote display protocol and multiple intermediaries is depicted. The server may include a remote display protocol engine for generating and transmitting data via the remote display protocol. The clients such as clients may include a remote display client agent for receiving and displaying data from the remote display protocol. The remote display protocol engine may generate a UCH for each of the bitmaps or glyphs to be communicated to the remote display protocol client agent. The remote display protocol engine may also include a disambiguation record generator for determining resolution of collisions between universal content handles of different bitmaps and generating a disambiguation record. The remote display protocol client agent uses the disambiguation record to disambiguate between the same handles for different bitmaps to identify the appropriate bitmap from a cache and or draw the appropriate bitmap to the display of the client.

In further overview the WAN intermediaries also referred to as appliances A N embodiments of which have been previously described herein may be deployed to provide acceleration of communications between the server and clients over a network such as a Wide Area Network WAN . The intermediaries may intercept the server and client communications. The network optimization engine may include a protocol parser for any one or more protocols communicated between the server and the client. The protocol parser may be designed and constructed to parse the remote display protocol. The intermediaries may store data from such communications to compression histories. These intermediaries may parse and store data to the compression histories from multiple remote display protocol sessions from multiple clients communicating with one or more servers. These intermediaries may store to the compression histories any of the content of the remote display protocol frame include handles bitmaps and commands of the remote display protocol.

The intermediaries use these shared compression histories to compress data communicated between the intermediaries. A first appliance A receives a remote display protocol communication from the server. The first appliance determines if any of the content of the communication matches content stored in the compression history. The first appliance generates a compressed data communication to send to the second appliance. The compressed data message may include one or more identifiers to the matched content in the compression history shared between the intermediaries . For example the identifier may identify a location and a length of the content in the compression history. The compressed data message may also include content that was not matched or the match did not meet predetermined criteria and or as originally received from the communication of the server. The second appliance N receives the compressed communication from the first appliance A. The second appliance uses the identifiers to the matched content to obtain the content from the compression history. The second appliance then uses the content from the compression history to reconstruct a copy of the original communication from the server to the client. The second appliance transmits this reconstructed communication to the client.

The remote display protocol engine also referred to as a RDP engine may use any type and form of algorithm encryption or hash to generate a universal content handle based on content of the bitmap or glyph or any portion thereof. The remote display protocol engine may use for example a predetermined number of bits as hash such as a 16 bit hash of the content or any portion thereof. In some embodiments the remote display protocol engine may use a hash longer than a predetermined number of bits and then truncate the longer hash to the predetermined number of bits.

Referring now to an embodiment of a method of compressing data of a remote display protocol using a universal content handle and disambiguation record. At step a server generates universal content handles UCHs for data for remote display protocol. At step the server determines any collisions of UCHs and generates disambiguation records for the remote display protocol. At step the server generates remote display protocol frames with disambiguation records to be transmitted to the client. At step intermediaries intercept remote display protocol communications parse and store data to compression histories. At step a first intermediary finds matches in compression history generates compressed communications and sends the compressed communications to the second intermediary. At step a second intermediary receives compressed communications finds identified matches in compression history and generates remote display protocol communication to the client. At step client receives an uncompressed frame of remote display protocol from the second intermediary. At step the client determines using a disambiguation record if there is a disambiguation and resolves the disambiguation. At step the client displays output by remote display client in accordance with resolution from disambiguation.

At step the remote display protocol engine of the server generates universal content handles UCHs for data of the remote display protocol. In further embodiments the server receives data or content generated by an application of the server and generates UCHs corresponding to the portions of the content or data. In some embodiments as the application on the server generates display output the remote display protocol engine generates identifies or otherwise obtains bitmaps or glyphs representing the changes to the display output. In some embodiments the server generates a UCH as each bitmap or glyph is generated or provided. In another embodiments the server generates UCHs in batches for a plurality of bitmap or glyphs.

At step a component of the server such as a remote display protocol engine determines if there are any collisions of UCHs and generates disambiguation records for the remote display protocol. In some embodiments remote display protocol engine matches the generated UCH with a plurality of previously generated UCHs to find a match. The matched previously generated UCH may be identical to the newly generated UCH. In some embodiments the matched previously generated UCH may comprise a portion that is identical to a portion of the newly generated UCH. If a match is found remote display protocol engine determines that there is a collision of the newly generated UCH with a previously generated UCH. A disambiguation record generator of the server may generate a disambiguation record in response to a determined or detected collision.

At step a component of the server such as a remote display protocol engine generates remote display protocol frames having a disambiguation record and transmits the remote display protocol frames to the client. In some embodiments the remote display protocol engine generates a frame for one command that includes a UCH and or bitmap or glyph. In another embodiment the remote display protocol engine generates multiple frames at a time. In still further embodiments the remote display protocol engine generates the remote display protocol frame that includes one or more disambiguation records. In some embodiments the remote display protocol engine generates the frame first and determines the UCHs to disambiguated based on the generated frame. In these embodiments the remote display protocol engine may then add one or more disambiguation records to the frame.

At step a first intermediary intercepts remote display protocol communications parses the remote display protocol communications and stores data to compression histories. In some embodiments protocol parser of an appliance receiving remote display protocol frame from the server parses the remote display protocol frame. In some embodiments the first intermediary stores some parsed portions of the remote display protocol frame are stored in the compression history. In other embodiments the first intermediary stores the payload of the remote display protocol frame to the compression history. Likewise as the second intermediary receives remote display protocol communications the second intermediary may parse such communications and store data from the remote display protocol to the compression history. In this manner the first and second intermediaries share at least some of the same data from the communications in order to perform compression between the intermediaries.

At step the first intermediary finds matches in compression history generates compressed communications and sends the compressed communications to the second intermediary. In some embodiments the first intermediary may use any type and form of location identifier and length of match in the compressed message. This location identifier and length of match identifies the matched content shared between the compression histories of the intermediaries. Such compressed communications may be forwarded or sent to the second intermediary or the client .

At step the second intermediary or the client receives compressed communications from the first intermediary. The secondary intermediary uses the location identifier and length of match to obtain content from the compression history. The second intermediary generates or reconstructs the remote display protocol communication sent from the server and to be sent to the client. The second intermediary forwards the reconstructed and or uncompressed remote display protocol communication to the client.

At step a remote display protocol client agent of the client receives uncompressed frame of the remote display protocol. In some embodiments the remote display protocol agent receives a portion of the uncompressed frame of the remote display protocol forwarded by the second intermediary. In other embodiments the remote display protocol agent receives multiple uncompressed frames of the remote display protocol. In yet another embodiment the remote display protocol agent receives a compressed frame of the remote display protocol and the agent uncompresses the frame.

At step client determines if there is any disambiguation via identification of the disambiguation record and or identifying conflicting UCHs. The remote display protocol agent may use the disambiguation record to resolve conflicts between UCHs and identify the corresponding bitmaps or glyphs. In some embodiments if a conflict exists between a newly generated UCH and a previously generated UCH client uses a disambiguation record of the remote display protocol frame to resolve the conflict and identify the bitmap or portion of data that the newly generated UCH of the remote display protocol frame refers to. The client may resolve the disambiguation by using any combination of the UCH the bitmap or glyphs and any one or more of current or previous disambiguation records.

At step the client displays output by remote display client in accordance with the resolution of the disambiguation. In some embodiments the client displays the output using the bitmap or the portion of stored data that is identified using the newly generated UCH in combination with the disambiguation record. The client may use the identified bitmap to generate the output that is displayed to the client . In some embodiments the output displayed to the client includes a graphical display file. In other embodiments the output displayed by the client includes a streaming video or audio file. In further embodiments the output displayed by the client includes a webpage or website. In still further embodiments the output displayed by the client includes a word document email document or any other type and form of an application service or resource provided by the server .

Referring now to an embodiment of a system and method for negotiating remote display protocol capabilities between a client and a server via intermediaries is depicted. In brief overview a client via client agent may initiate a handshake transaction of the remote display protocol to negotiate capabilities. The handshake transaction may identify whether or not the client supports the version of the remote display protocol that supports disambiguation or a version of the remote display protocol that does not support disambiguation. As the handshake communicates is received by each of the intermediaries A N each intermediary may inspect the communication to determine if the client has the disambiguation capability of the remote display protocol. Each intermediary may identify in the handshake communication whether or not the intermediary also supports the remote display protocol with the disambiguation capability. The server receives the handshake communication from the intermediary and determines if the client and or intermediaries supports the disambiguation protocol. If so the server transmits a response identifying the server supports and will transmit the remote display protocol with disambiguation.

The appliances A N may include a protocol inspector which determines whether or not a communication identifies support for the remote display protocol with disambiguation. The protocol inspector may be included in any of the components of the intermediary or appliance . In one embodiment the network optimization engine or any component thereof includes the protocol inspector. For example any of the flow controller packet processing engine LAN WAN detector protocol accelerator cache manager or policy engine shown and described in connection with may include the protocol inspector. In some embodiments the protocol parser of includes the protocol inspector.

The protocol inspector may include any type and form of executable instructions executing on a processor of the appliance or of any device running the network optimization engine . The protocol inspector may include functions operations or logic to determine whether or not a communication such as a remote display protocol handshake frame identifies supports or otherwise conforms with the remote display protocol having a disambiguation record or capability. The protocol inspector may determine if the communication identifies the client sending the communication as supporting the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. The protocol inspector may determine if the communication identifies the server sending the communication as supporting the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. The protocol inspector may determine if the communication identifies the intermediary receiving the communication as having the disambiguation protocol. The protocol inspector may add the intermediary s capabilities to the communication. In some embodiments the protocol inspector adds to or modifies the communication to identify the intermediary as supporting the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. In other embodiments the protocol inspector adds to or modifies the communication to identify any one or more of the server an intermediary or intermediaries and client as supporting the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. In another embodiment the protocol inspector modifies the communication to remove the identification of support of the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol for any one or more of the server an intermediary or intermediaries and client.

In brief overview of the illustrated method at step a remote display protocol client agent of client may initiate a remote display protocol handshake with the server . The client agent may identify the capabilities of the client for the remote display protocol and may identify that the client agent supports or has the disambiguation capability described herein. At step each of the intermediary inspects the capabilities of the handshake communication from the client. If the handshake communication identifies the client as supporting the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol the intermediary adds the intermediaries capabilities to the handshake communication. At step the server receives the handshake communication from the intermediaries and determines if the client and or intermediaries supports disambiguation. If the session from client to server via the intermediaries supports the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol the server responds to the handshake communication of the client to enable the remote display protocol to be compressed by the appliance. At step the client receives the response from the server to complete the handshake transaction and negotiation of capabilities.

In further detail at step the client agent such as an ICA client in some embodiments may generate and transmit one or more remote display protocol frames to initiate or establish a session with the server. The client agent may generate and transmit one or more remote display protocol frames to identify exchange or negotiate capabilities between the client and server. The client agent may generate and transmit one or more remote display protocol frames to identify exchange or negotiate capabilities between the client agent and server remote display protocol engine. The client agent may generate and transmit one or more remote display protocol frames to identify exchange or negotiate capabilities corresponding to or related to the remote display protocol used or supported by the client agent and or remote display protocol engine.

The client agent may identify or advertise one or more capabilities via any portion of the remote display protocol frame such as a header field or portions of the payload. The capabilities may be identified via the remote display protocol using any form or format such as name value pairs and attribute values. The client agent may identify that the client agent supports disambiguation by any type and form of predetermined value or identifier. In some embodiments the client agent may identify that the client agent supports the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol by identifying specifying or defining a version of the remote display protocol. In one embodiment the client agent may identify the highest version of the remote display protocol that the client agent supports. In another embodiment the client agent may identify a version of the remote display protocol that the client agent queries the server to determine if the server supports such a version. In some embodiments the client agent also identifies whether or not the intermediary or appliance such as the client side appliance supports or recognizes the remote display protocol having disambiguation. In this manner the client agent in some cases identifies the disambiguation capability of both the client and the intermediary.

At step an intermediary such as an appliance receives the communication sent from the client to advertise the remote display protocol related capabilities to the server. The intermediary may parse the remote display protocol communication via the protocol parser. The intermediary may inspect the communication to identify whether or not the client advertised support for the disambiguation protocol. The intermediary may inspect the communication to identify whether or not the client advertised support by the intermediary for the disambiguation protocol. The intermediary may modify the communication to identify whether or not the intermediary supports the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. The intermediary may also modify the communication to identify whether or not the client supports the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. In some embodiments the intermediary does not modify the communication as the communication already identifies the disambiguation capability of the intermediary or the intermediary is unaware of such disambiguation capabilities.

A first appliance or intermediary may perform the inspection in some embodiments modify the communication and forward the communication to a second appliance or intermediary. The second appliance may perform any of the embodiments of step described herein. The second appliance forwards to the server the communication received from the first appliance and processed further by the second appliance. This communication may identify the capabilities of the client and each of the intermediaries. In some embodiments the communication identifies the disambiguation capabilities of the client and each of the intermediaries. In another embodiment the communication identifies that the client supports a disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. In other embodiments the communication identifies that the transmission path or the session from the server to the client may transmit the remote display protocol having disambiguation or a disambiguation record. In some embodiments the communication identifies that one of the client or an intermediary does not support disambiguation capabilities. In another embodiment the communication identifies the version of the remote display protocol supported by any one or more of the client and any intermediary between the client and the server.

In some embodiments both the appliances support the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. In another embodiment the appliances support different versions of the remote display protocol. In some cases although the appliances support different versions of the remote display protocol the versions may each support or have disambiguation capabilities. In other embodiments one appliance supports the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol and the other appliance does not support the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol.

At step the server receives the communication forwarded by an intermediary. For example the server such as via remote display protocol engine may receive the handshake remote display protocol frame inspected and processed by any of the intermediaries. From the communication the server determines what version of the remote display protocol to use for the session or for which to establish the session. From inspection of the capabilities identified by the communication the server determines whether or not the client supports or has a disambiguation capability and or what version of the disambiguation capability. From inspection of the capabilities identified by the communication the server determines whether or not any of the intermediaries supports the disambiguation capability. From inspection of the capabilities identified by the communication the server determines whether or not the client and each of the intermediaries supports the disambiguation capability or the same disambiguation capability.

Responsive to the determination regarding disambiguation capabilities the server determines the version of the remote display protocol to use for the remote display protocol session or for which to advertise to the client and or intermediaries. The server via the remote display protocol engine may generate and transmit to the client a response to the handshake or negotiation capabilities communication of the client. The server may identify that the server supports the same version of the remote display protocol advertised by the client. The server may determine that the client or an intermediary does not support disambiguation and responsive to this determination the server identifies to the client and or the intermediaries that the server is using a remote display protocol that does not support disambiguation.

The server s response to the client may provide information to identify or enable the intermediaries to perform compression on the remote display protocol if the client and the intermediaries support the disambiguation version of the remote display protocol. The server may identify via the response that the server and client may not perform compression on the remote display protocol. The server may identify via the response that the server and client may not cache the remote display protocol. In some embodiments the server and client may perform compression and or caching although the intermediaries may also compress the communications of the remote display protocol. In some embodiments the server and client may not perform compression although the intermediary compress the communications of the remote display protocol.

At step the client receives the response from the server and uses the version of the remote display protocol determined by the server. In some embodiments if each of the client server and the intermediaries support the disambiguation capability the server and client communicate using the version of the remote display protocol having a disambiguation record. In another embodiment if any one or more of the client the server or an intermediary does not support the disambiguation protocol the client and the server use a version of the remote display protocol that does not support disambiguation or have a disambiguation record. In some embodiments responsive to the handshake response of the server the client agent does not compress remote display protocol communications generated or communicated. by the client agent and or the server does not compress remote display protocol communications transmitted by the server. Instead the one or more intermediaries may perform compression of the remote display protocol communicated between the client and the server.
