abstract: The method may include collecting performance data relating to processing nodes of a computer system which provide services via one or more applications, analyzing the performance data to generate an operational profile characterizing resource usage of the processing nodes, receiving a set of attributes characterizing expected performance goals in which the services are expected to be provided, and generating at least one provisioning policy based on an analysis of the operational profile in conjunction with the set of attributes. The at least one provisioning policy may specify a condition for re-allocating resources associated with at least one processing node in a manner that satisfies the performance goals of the set of attributes. The method may further include re-allocating, during runtime, the resources associated with the at least one processing node when the condition of the at least one provisioning policy is determined as satisfied.

This application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 848 298 filed on Aug. 31 2007 which claims priority to non provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60 824 240 filed Aug. 31 2006 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The subject matter of the present disclosure relates to a system and method for automatically provisioning the capacity of a computer system.

Capacity planning tools can be used to plan the capacity of a computer system and manage its performance. To do this capacity planning tools focus on 1 identifying performance bottlenecks in the computer system and 2 providing what if functionalities that can be used to evaluate performance implications of different hardware configurations of that system. Other tools referred to as system provisioning tools can be used to provision the computer system with the goal of setting up a configuration that is cost effective from a business perspective. To effectively achieve this goal provisioning tools need intelligent input to determine what and how many servers and other system components are needed to satisfy the service level objectives SLOs of the computer system.

Unfortunately prior art capacity planning tools do not provide direct input to provisioning tools nor do they receive any direct feedback from the provisioned computer system that could be used to validate or adjust the system s configuration. Instead users have to translate performance information such as reports and graphs into system recommendations and then input those recommendations into the provisioning tool for execution because direct output from the prior art capacity planning tool would not be usable by the prior art provisioning tool. Due to these problems prior art provisioning tools provision a computer system based merely on user inputted rules or on rule of thumb. Moreover prior art provisioning tools rely on policies that are static and that may or may not reflect historical demands of the computer system for resources. In short prior art provisioning tools do not take provisioning actions on potential computing needs based on historic resource usage patterns. They are purely reactive rather than proactive.

In accordance with one embodiment an automated system manages and provisions a computer system which can be a physical or virtual enterprise system. During operation the automated system obtains performance data pertaining to the computer system s processing nodes e.g. servers which are partitioned into partitions. Performance data can include. Inter alia a performance rating and measured utilization values for each of the computer system s processing nodes. Performance data can also include measurements of actual service levels such as response times workloads throughputs units of work per unit of time etc.

From the performance data related to performance rating and utilization values for example the automated system normalizes a utilization value for each of the processing nodes over a period of time and generates a weighted average for each utilization value. Also during operation the automated system receives service level objectives SLO for the computer system and automatically determines provisioning policies based on these SLOs. For example automated system can automatically determined provisioning policies using the received SLOs and the weighted average normalized utilization values determined from the performance data automatically determines provisioning policies. In such an example the provisioning policies can thereby indicate desired outcome service level information such as a number of processing nodes required to meet the SLOs an arrival value e.g. throughput for transactions to each of the processing nodes and a potential service level for each of the processing nodes.

Based on the provisioning policies the automated system automatically provisions at least some of the processing nodes across the partitions to load balance the system s capacity. As used herein provisioning the processing nodes by the automated system can include such actions as sending routing directing or distributing system transactions to the processing nodes e.g. servers and such actions as installing removing or activating deactivating processing nodes e.g. servers to process transactions. With the automatically generated policies and provisioning the automated system is both proactive and reactive. Its proactive aspect generates policies based on analysis of current and historical information and its reactive aspect analyzes current and historical information and reacts accordingly using the generated policies.

As discussed below recommendation tool automatically provides provisioning policies to automatically manage and provision the computer system . In general recommendation tool can be a standalone software tool implemented and deployed as a Web Service capable of operating in conjunction with other tools. In addition recommendation tool can function automatically implying that it does not rely on user intervention via a user interface. Preferably an Application Programming Interface API allows recommendation tool to use scripts and command line instructions to automate the run time operation of the tool.

Provisioning tool receives the provisioning policies from recommendation tool and automatically provisions the computer system accordingly. Provisioning tool is capable of physically and or logically provisioning system components into nodes of a physical or virtual system. For a virtual system provisioning tool can add a virtual layer to the computer system using virtualization features. As will be appreciated provisioning the computer system as a virtual system requires that the system hardware e.g. servers applications etc. have sufficient processing power to support a specified number of virtual partitions not shown . In addition each virtual partition requires its own or shared operating system and applications that run on the operating system.

The data collection tool collects performance data about system components from data collectors distributed throughout computer system . For example the data collectors can be monitoring agents to collect performance data about processing nodes e.g. servers and provide the collected performance data to the data collection tool . In turn a data repository stores the collected data for use by recommendation tool . Data repository can be any database data source or file system known in the art for storing the collected data. Ultimately recommendation tool in conjunction with the provisioning tool and data collection tool manages the computer system s capacity using an automated capacity provisioning process such as discussed below with reference to .

As shown in automated process of data collectors collect performance data of computer system and data collection tool stores the performance data in data repository Block . The performance data can include various metrics known and used in the art. As an example BMC Performance Manager or BMC Performance Assurance Suite for Servers can be used to collect performance data and store it in a database or a file system. Other data collection tools can also be used as long as the data is stored or can be retrieved in a predefined common format such as CSV ASCII XML or through a predefined API Application Programming Interface .

With the performance data collected recommendation tool analyzes the collected data and generates a system operational profile Block . In one embodiment operational profile can characterize resource usage of computer system or partitions thereof over one or more time periods. In alternative embodiments operational profile can characterize service levels in computer system . Such service levels can represent response times of servers when subjected to given workloads or can represent the ability of servers to process given workloads or throughputs. In creating operational profile recommendation tool may focus on the collected data from system components such as server processors and CPUs and on fixed attachments such as cache memory and onboard disks as well as service level information above.

During the normal course of operation recommendation tool also receives a set of Service Level Objectives SLOs Block . The SLOs can come from any conventional source in computer system such as from controller . In addition the SLOs can be received or obtained from a workload manager computing device or other source having management and compliance information for one or more Service Level Objectives SLO or Service Level Agreements SLA . As is known in the art an SLA defines static and dynamic attributes that the system s services must satisfy between a consumer and a provider. The SLAs dynamic attributes relate to variables that may change in real time and may depend on how the services are actually performing. Some examples of attributes include response times for transactions expected time to finish tasks SLA violation rates of a service reliability of a service availability of a service etc. As is also known in the art an SLO defines specific attributes of a given service associated with an SLA.

Based on the operational profile and the received SLOs recommendation tool generates a set of provisioning policies for use in provisioning the computer system s resources Block . Depending on the implementation these provisioning policies can be used to directly provision the computer system or can be used at times when certain total workloads are expected when such workloads are encountered in practice or when certain performance characteristics are encountered. Preferably the generated provisioning policies factor in performance of the system components over a period of time that is long enough to account for variances in business cycles.

In general the generated provisioning policies define plans of action for guiding provisioning decisions to produce desired outcomes. The plans of action can be characterized as one or more statements a set or collection of rules and or a set of if . . . then . . . else . . . predicates. For example a given SLA may state that business application response time must be less than 1 second 95 of the time. To achieve this analysis of the historical performance data is used to identify resource usage patterns for near future resource provisioning and allocation. Furthermore the analysis can be used to generate provisioning policies as a developed set of rules or the like to implement desired outcomes based on predictive analysis and what if scenarios. The policies can then be used to provision the computer system s resources in terms of what how and when available servers and or other resources are needed to support applications associated with the various SLOs .

To generate policies recommendation tool can use time dependent information utilization levels response times transaction arrival rates and other resource usage information. Additionally recommendation tool can use trending analysis predictive analysis what if scenarios and user input to the resource usage information to generate the policies. For example recommendation tool can use trending analysis of predicted resource requirements to generate policies that match current past application performance. Moreover to generate policies recommendation tool can perform predictive analysis on application performance requirements and can use what if scenarios and user input.

As it operates recommendation tool can continually and automatically generate the policies and modify existing policies based on the historical and current information that has been collected and analyzed. In turn the generated policies can provide different levels of reactivity and proactivity for provisioning computer system . For example one type of policy can correlate time dependent information such as historical resource utilization and needed servers and can state for example every Monday at 7 55 AM allocate x serves. Another type of policy can correlate utilization and needed servers and can state for example if the average utilization of the servers is more than x then allocate y additional servers with performance rating z. Yet another type of policy can correlate response time and needed servers and can state for example if and when average response time for transactions is measured over x minutes to be more than y seconds and existing server utilization is more than z then immediately allocate n additional servers then and there. Another type of policy can correlate arrival rate and needed servers and can state for example as soon as transaction arrival rate exceeds x transactions per minute for more than y minutes allocate z additional servers.

Once generated provisioning policies can be used for look up by provisioning tool when determining provisioning actions to perform to computer system . Alternatively recommendation tool can send the policy rules as provisioning decisions to provisioning tool to be acted on directly. In the end provisioning policies may result in an indication of candidate servers and other resources that can be repurposed or that can be physically or virtually consolidated to handle various applications and tasks. Besides focusing on servers recommendation tool may also take into consideration other features of a computer system such as network connections and detached storage devices to ensure overall system performance.

Using the generated provisioning policies provisioning tool dynamically provisions a proper number of servers of a certain computing power or other resources when needed so that the provisioned result ensures that the requirements of the received SLOs are met Block . As an example the Run Book Automation software from RealOps or a product similar to the previously available BMC Virtualizer for Capacity on Demand product can be used for dynamic provisioning based on the generated provisioning policies. Alternatively provisioning mechanisms in VMware can be used.

As shown in the automated process of Blocks through can be implemented as an ongoing process so that collecting and analyzing performance data including resource utilization workload and service levels generating policies and executing those policies can be repeated as needed. The process can also monitor and modify its performance as it continues. In this way the process can update policies and validate SLOs on a continuous basis. If the probability of meeting a given SLO is below a certain level for example a policy generated at Block may need to be updated using more recently collected performance data from data repository . Alternatively the attributes defined by an SLO may need to be modified. In the end the frequency with which provisioning policies are updated may depend on the rate of change in resource demands and may also depend on updates to SLOs by users and business applications.

By using performance data for long term capacity provisioning the process may be less manually intensive and as a result require less specific performance modeling and capacity planning efforts than prior art provisioning techniques. Moreover because the process is automated in real time provisioning policies can be quickly updated based on feedback of how applications perform against the attributes of the SLOs .

Further details related to the automated system and process are shown in . As schematically shown by a graph performance data collected and stored in data repository can include historical as well as real time CPU utilization data for each of the various servers of the computer system and may have been collected for weeks or months from computer system . As discussed previously recommendation tool analyzes this performance data and generates an operational profile. In embodiments discussed previously the operational profile can characterize service levels in computer system in a certain configuration and having a certain capacity such as response times of servers when subjected to given workloads or the ability of severs to process given workloads or throughputs.

In the present embodiment operational profile characterizes resource usage of computer system over time so that it can be termed a resource usage profile such as schematically shown by graph . This resource usage profile captures workload oriented information related to resource usage and history of computer system that can be used in its capacity management. In this example resource usage profile encompasses a one week interval 7 days 24 hours with data points for each hour so that the profile has 168 data points. Alternatively resource usage profile can encompass one or more one week intervals two week intervals monthly intervals particular business seasons or any other desirable time periods.

Based on the operational profile recommendation tool automatically generates several current and scheduled provisioning policies . Details of how recommendation tool automatically generates various provisioning policies are discussed later. In general the generated policies can include a collection of rules for provisioning computer system and recommendation tool can use trending analysis predictive analysis what if scenarios and user input to generate the policy rules from the information in the operational profile . Moreover the generated policies can be based on time dependent information utilization levels response times transaction arrival rates and other information. Once generated provisioning tool can automatically use the provisioning policies to provision the system components e.g. servers of computer system .

In addition to straight automation the automated provisioning system can include a user interface having a summary screen to display generated provisioning policies for user intervention and control. In the present example each policy can have a name a start date time etc. and a recurrence interval e.g. every number of days or months with or without a particular end date . Using summary screen users can manually change add and delete the automatically generated provisioning policies as desired.

In addition an additional screen can allow a user to set up dynamic rules for adjusting the load balancing associated with a given provisioning policy . As shown in this additional screen a user can indicate a priority for a service e.g. LoadGenerator and can assign a range of servers to that service. Then the user can assign dynamic rules to the service. As one example an assigned dynamic rule may stop one server of the service if the CPU utilization falls below 30 for 15 min. or add one server to the service if the CPU utilization exceeds 60 for 20 min. Other types of rules discussed herein could also be assigned.

After generating provisioning policies a controller or computing device executing provisioning tool implements provisioning policies among partitioned servers in the computer system s virtual environment so that servers can efficiently handle various SLOs. Controller in turn monitors results from implementing provisioning policies by collecting additional performance data that is subsequently used to create a current resource usage profile . In this way the entire process can be repeated to account for new loads changes in resources workloads new Service Level Objectives etc.

As shown in further detail in recommendation tool includes an assessment module a policy generating module and a migrating module . Briefly assessment module analyzes performance data collected by data collection tool and generates a system resource usage profile such as discussed previously. In turn policy generating module uses resource usage profile and received SLO information to generate provisioning policies discussed previously that provisioning tool can then directly execute or look up to provision servers of computer system . Independently migrating module also receives a copy of provisioning policies and estimates a number of homogenous servers needed to support the applications currently running on heterogeneous servers before migration.

Each of these modules and are discussed individually in more detail with reference to . Currently however discussion focuses on the overall operational details of recommendation tool .

During operation recommendation tool obtains input data that includes the number N of available servers of the computer system . For each available server i 1 2 . . . N the input data also includes the server s performance rating Pand the performance rating type the server s SLO value SLO and the SLO type e.g. utilization or mean response time and the server s current measured utilization U. The performance rating Pcan be characterized by any commonly used performance rating system.

Based upon the input data recommendation tool produces output data that determines a the number n of servers required to meet the SLOs b the recommended arrival rate of transactions or service requests to each of the servers used for load balancing and c whether the overall service goal can be achieved and provide a best possible solution if the service goal cannot be achieved . In general output data represents analytical information that provisioning tool can use to perform bounded scale out provisioning in the virtual environment of computer system . The solution is bounded or limited in the sense that the virtual environment actually has a maximum number of physical servers N of given processing power

As shown in one embodiment output data includes a number n of required servers i 1 2 . . . n from available servers and an indication whether the requisite processing goal can be achieved e.g. where 0 means not achievable and 1 means achievable . For each required server i 1 2 . . . n the output data also includes a recommended arrival rate and a Potential Service Level PSL at the given server. The arrival rate defines the recommended rate of arrival of transactions or service requests to a given server. By definition the arrival rate is greater than 0 and less or equal to 1 and is characterized by

Calculations performed by recommendation tool can be based on various statistical assumptions. Using assumptions associated with an M M 1 type queuing system recommendation tool can use the following set of computations to generate the illustrative output data . For a given server processing power P i 1 2 . . . n the optimal arrival rate of transactions made to a given server i can be defined by 

If the load is heavy i.e. the total arrival rate to be distributed among servers P sP then the arrival rate to each server should approach the service rate of the server 

If the SLO type is a utilization value then recommendation tool tries to find a solution such that the utilization of a given server is less than or equal to the value of its SLO i.e. u SLO for all active n servers. If the SLO type is a mean response time recommendation tool tries to find a solution such that the mean response time at a given server is less than or equal to the value of its SLO i.e. r SLO for all active a servers. Consequently the mean response time r at server i can be computed as 

If not all the SLOs can be achieved then recommendation tool will provide the best possible load balancing to distribute transactions based on the various recommended arrival rates of the available servers l 1 2 . . . N .

For a given node i.e. server and in one embodiment the input includes Node Name Performance Rating Type performance rating i.e. processing power P utilization service level objective SLO number of desired time intervals to be assessed T and CPU utilization data for T intervals x x . . . x.

For each interval of the time period e.g. each hour of the 7 24 period statistical analysis algorithm computes the following statistical values a measured average utilization a weighted average utilization for the hour a weighted average normalized utilization for the hour WANU a minimum utilization for the hour x a maximum utilization for the hour x a coefficient of variation of CPU utilization for the hour C and a probability of exceeding the SLO for the hour p . These statistical values over the current time period of interest forms the resource usage profile discussed previously that is used to generate provisioning policies.

Details of the calculations performed by assessment module are as follows. For the T data points in the current time period assessment module computes a weighted average for the data points that places more emphasis on more recent data. To do this it is assumed that the importance of a particular interval is an importance factor times more important than the previous interval so that weights wfor the T data points are assigned in the following fashion 

In addition to the weights w the assessment module computes the measured average utilization for the T data points x x . . . x as follows 

After statistical analysis algorithm computes the above statistical values assessment module generates output data for each server that includes the node name e.g. server performance rating type performance rating P and the above computed statistical values representing the resource usage profile of computer system . This output data is then made available to policy generating module as described below.

In illustrative policy generating module includes a capacity module a predictive module and a what if module although other implementations may have only one such module or any combination thereof. Policy generating module receives input and generates one or more policies for provisioning computer system. As mentioned previously the policies can be characterized as a collection of rules to be looked up by provisioning tool when making provisioning decisions or can be characterized as provisioning decisions or commands sent to provisioning tool to act on directly.

Capacity module receives attributes defined in SLOs server information and historical information pertaining to resource utilization e.g. the resource usage profile from assessment module as its input . Using analysis described in more detail with reference to capacity module then generates policies to match resources to the application demand just in time .

As detailed below predictive module and what if module generate policies based on a combination of information pertaining to resources workloads service levels and time. For example the time information can be any given time interval the workload information can be an average arrival rate of x transactions or jobs the resource information can be the number of allocated servers and the service level information can be average response times or throughput. What if module can further produce different combinations of workloads and resources to determine what the resulting performance would be in each of the different combinations and whether the system will be saturated or not.

Illustrative predictive module receives various types of information as its input such as an operational profile characterizing server utilization actual workloads actual service levels and time related information. Predictive module applies historical trending and predictive analysis to the input information and generates policies that can then match current past application performance based on predicted resource requirements. Therefore predictive module can use a form of curve matching analysis based on forecasted demand i.e. expected workload . In other words predictive module can predict that at a given time a given number of x more servers may be needed where this prediction is partly based on what workload the system may be required to handle at that time or based on the expected utilization at the time.

In one example information about server utilization can be provided by the operational profile from assessment module and module can generate a policy indicating that high utilization levels will drive allocation of more servers based on analysis of server utilization information. In another example information about actual workloads can characterize what an application is attempting to do and can indicate for example transaction throughput e.g. how many transactions arrived each second or minute or job throughput e.g. how many batch jobs were submitted per day . Based on an analysis of such workload information module can generate a policy indicating that high workload requests will drive resource allocation before servers are utilized or before service levels deteriorate. In general high workload requests are the same as a high workload arrival rate which is the throughput in a steady state non saturated system.

In yet another example information about actual service levels can indicate what was the response time for the transactions how long it took to process batch jobs what was the throughput was the system able to execute all the workload etc. In addition service level agreements and objectives SLAs and SLOs can define such information as response time throughput and utilization. Based on an analysis of such service level information module can generate a policy indicating that certain levels of near poor service will drive certain resource allocation. Finally the time related information can indicate when the information pertaining to server utilization workload and service level occurred. Based on an analysis of this time related information module can generate a policy indicating that resources will be pre allocated at certain times.

What if module receives information as its input similar to that received by predictive module and what if module applies historical trending and predictive analysis to that information. However what if module further applies what if scenarios in its analysis to generate policies. In this way what if module can allow users to vary input of demand to produce what if scenarios so the module can then generate policies that match resource requirements to the demand input by the user.

In one example what if module accepts as user input a list of workldoad scenarios and desired service levels. The input may indicate for example that a response time of 1 second is expected at 100 transactions per second and that a response time of 2 seconds is expected at 1000 transactions per second. After analyzing the characteristics of the application what if module runs a series of what if scenarios to discover the desired amount of resources. In other words in a scenario for 100 transactions per second the module may predict what would be the response time if 2 servers 4 servers 8 servers 10 servers and 20 servers were used.

After analysis what if module then determines the smallest number of servers required to meet the desired service objective at the given workload level. In turn this determined information is used to generate a policy that can state a predicate such as if transaction rate is 100 transactions per second for application having stated characteristics is encountered then provision x servers with y processing power. Even if these conditions are not met the generated policy is still created to handle such an eventuality in a particular business scenario. If and when the eventuality does occur in the future then the provisioning tool can implement the generated policy and there would be no need to first experience and then detect poor performance.

As shown in illustrative capacity module receives input data performs operations of the provisioning algorithm and generates output data to be used to provision the servers of the computer system . In the illustrated embodiment the input data includes a performance rating type performance ratings of m servers available for provisioning P P . . . P service level objectives of each of the m servers SLO SLO . . . SLO and a headroom value added for the required servers H . In addition input data includes weighted average normalized unitization values WANU i j from assessment module for each hour i of the time period e.g. 7 24 and for each server j. This information essentially corresponds to the current historical performance data in the resource usage profile of the computer system .

Using the input data capacity module begins operations of provisioning algorithm by calculating server requirements for every hour of the 7 24 time period Block . For example for each hour i of the 7 24 time period capacity module calculates a weighted average normalized unitization total WANUT using the weighted average normalized unitization values WANU i j as follows 

With the above calculations illustrative capacity module calculates a list of 168 numbers denoted as m 1 m 2 . . . m 168 . This list represents server requirements for every hour of the 7 24 time period i.e. 168 data points . Preferably capacity module determines server demands based a sensitivity variable and divides the list of server demands into a plurality of segments so that the sensitivity variable can control how frequently policies should be updated to reflect the demands on servers Block . Moreover capacity module preferably consolidates the list of server demands by combining together those adjacent segments having identical server demands Block . In other words capacity module does not need to set a policy for every segment if two adjacent segments have the same server demand. In such a case the later identical demand could be removed from the list and such consolidation can continue until capacity module obtains a list without identical adjacent server demands.

After obtaining the consolidated list of server demands capacity module sets policies for each listed server demand Block . To do this capacity module computes transaction weights wto supply to load balancer of provisioning tool to control the arrival rate of transactions to the servers . Based on the processing power Pof a given server k the SLO for that server SLO and the total server requirements the transaction weight wfor a given server k is calculated as follows 

In addition to information on available servers the input data includes information on currently consolidated servers including a performance rating P of the consolidated servers a number of virtual partitions Vn over the consolidated servers a utilization Service Level Objective SLO of the consolidated servers a utilization overhead H introduced for each required server with a performance rating and a utilization overhead h introduced for each virtual partition. Moreover input data includes information from assessment module including a maximum utilization U i j for each hour i of the 7 24 time period and each available server j.

Using input data migrating module performs a migrating algorithm to determine how to migrate or consolidate available servers. First migrating algorithm calculates a maximum normalized unitization total MNUT for all of the available servers N over the 7 24 time period Block . The calculation is as follows 

Migrating module then determines whether the server overhead is grater than the partition overhead by determining if H h Vn SLO Decision . If there is too much overhead migrating module sends out an error message such as The overheads are greater than the utilization SLO Block . If there is not too much overhead migrating module determines the number n of required servers with performance rating P Block using the calculation 

Migrating module produces output data that includes the performance rating type the performance rating P the maximum normalized utilization total MNUT and the number n of required servers with performance rating P. This output can then be used by the provisioning tool to migrate the various servers among the virtual partitions.
