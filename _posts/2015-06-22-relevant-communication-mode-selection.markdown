title: Relevant communication mode selection
abstract: When initiating a communication session, a user may be faced with the challenge of deciding which communication mode to use to contact and/or share content with one or more other users intended for participation in the communication session. A communication application may be configured to provide a relevant communication mode selection, the communication application including selection and communication modules. For example, the selection module of the communication application may determine available communication modes in response to detection of a request to initiate a communication session from within an application or from a user experience provided by the communication application. The selection module may remove one or more unused communication modes, and prioritize the remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode. A communication module of the communication application may then automatically initiate the communication session through the selected communication mode.

When initiating a communication session a user may be faced with the challenge of deciding which communication mode to use to contact one or more other users intended for participation in the communication session. For example in a typical work environment the user may have a choice of using email social networking instant messaging or text messaging to contact the other users. Existing solutions may offer the user a choice of communication modes in a list however these solutions involve performance of an additional user selection step and often present communication modes that are unlikely to be selected.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustrations specific embodiments or examples. These aspects may be combined other aspects may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.

While some embodiments will be described in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with an application program that runs on an operating system on a personal computer those skilled in the art will recognize that aspects may also be implemented in combination with other program modules.

Generally program modules include routines programs components data structures and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments may be practiced with other computer system configurations including hand held devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics minicomputers mainframe computers and comparable computing devices. Embodiments may also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.

Some embodiments may be implemented as a computer implemented process method a computing system or as an article of manufacture such as a computer program product or computer readable media. The computer program product may be a computer storage medium readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program that comprises instructions for causing a computer or computing system to perform example process es . The computer readable storage medium is a computer readable memory device. The computer readable storage medium can for example be implemented via one or more of a volatile computer memory a non volatile memory a hard drive a flash drive a floppy disk or a compact disk and comparable hardware media.

Throughout this specification the term platform may be a combination of software and hardware components for relevant communication mode selection. Examples of platforms include but are not limited to a hosted service executed over a plurality of servers an application executed on a highest prioritized computing device and comparable systems. The term server generally refers to a computing device executing one or more software programs typically in a networked environment. However a server may also be implemented as a virtual server software programs executed on one or more computing devices viewed as a server on the network. More detail on these technologies and example operations is provided below.

In an example embodiment the first user an initiating user may request to initiate a communication session with the second user a target user through the word processing application . For example the first user may request to share a document from the word processing application with the second user . The selection module of the communication application may be configured to detect the request to initiate the communication session from within the word processing application and determine available communication modes. The available communication modes may be determined based on the first user and or the second user and or based on the network over which the first user and or the second user are communicating. In other examples the first user may request to initiate a communication session with the second user through a user experience provided by the communication application .

The selection module may be configured to remove unused communication modes. An unused communication mode may be identified for removal by determining whether the first user and the second user have subscribed to a service that provides the communication mode and whether the first user and the second user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode ever and or recently. Accordingly if the first user or the second user have not subscribed to a service or logged into a subscription account using the communication mode ever and or recently the communication mode may be removed. For example if the first user and or the second user have not subscribed to a service or logged into a subscription account using a video communication mode the video communication mode may be removed.

The selection module may then be configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode where the selected communication mode may be email messaging for example. In some embodiments a communication mode may be prioritized if the communication mode is used frequently by one or both of the first user and the second user and or is used frequently by the first user when communicating with the second user . Frequent use of a communication mode may be defined herein as when a ratio of a number of communication sessions initiated using the communication mode to a total number of communication sessions initiated is above a predefined ratio. For example the first user may frequently use an email messaging communication mode if the first user uses the email messaging communication mode at least 7 out of 10 communication sessions. In other embodiments a communication mode may be prioritized if the communication mode has been explicitly defined as a selected communication mode by one or both of the first user and the second user . For example the second user may explicitly define email messaging as a selected communication mode.

Furthermore determination of priority may be determined using the ratio of the number of communication sessions of one mode versus the number of communication sessions of another mode. For example the first user may initiate a large absolute number of communication sessions via a text messaging mode but the number may still be small compared with an even larger number of communication sessions initiated via an email messaging mode. This comparison may also be determined by giving more weight in the ratio to more recent communications. For example the first user may initiate an equal number of communication sessions in text messaging and email messaging modes but may not have used the text messaging mode as recently.

In some examples a communication mode may be prioritized based on one or more of a location and an availability status of one or both of the first user and the second user . For example if a location and availability status of the second user indicates the second user is out of the office and unavailable the communication mode prioritized may include email messaging. Alternatively if a location and availability status of the second user indicates the second user is at a worksite and available the communication mode prioritized may include instant messaging or voice communication. In another example the prioritization based on the location and the availability status may reflect whether it is convenient for the recipient to communicate in a given mode. For example if the location of the second user is determined to be in a moving car voice communication may be prioritized.

In other examples a communication mode may be prioritized that one or both of the first user and the second user are currently using and or based on capabilities of a current device used by one or both of the first user and the second user . For example the first user and the second user may be using a laptop and may be currently using email messaging. Accordingly email messaging may be prioritized. Capabilities of a device may include one or more communication or presentation capabilities of that include one of voice communication audio communication video communication email messaging text messaging instant messaging application sharing or data sharing. For example a smart phone may be capable of voice audio video communication email messaging and text messaging but may not have instant messaging capabilities.

In some embodiments a confidence level in the prioritization of the remaining available communication modes may be determined where the confidence level may be a percentage of confidence that the prioritization is accurate based on a ratio of priority criteria that correspond to a highest prioritized communication mode. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by the first user and or the second user and definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by the first user and or the second user . The priority criteria may also include a location and availability status of the first user and or the second user current use of the communication mode by the first user and or the second user and capabilities of a device currently being used by the first user and or the second user as described in detail above. For example if the highest prioritized communication mode of the remaining available communication modes is an email messaging communication mode and 8 out of 10 priority criteria are determined to correspond to the email messaging communication mode a confidence level of 80 may be determined.

In some examples there may be a first threshold and a second threshold of the confidence level that may determine selection of the communication mode. For example a first threshold may be 75 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes and a second threshold may be 50 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes. In response to a determination that the confidence level is above the first threshold the highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode. Accordingly in the example scenario above the 80 confidence level is above the first threshold 75 confidence level and thus the email messaging communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected mode. In response to a determination that the confidence level is below the first threshold and above the second threshold the highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected with an option provided to the first user and or second user to change the selected communication mode. In response to a determination that the confidence level is below the second threshold a list of the prioritized communication modes may be presented to the first user and or second user for explicit selection of the communication mode.

In other embodiments the determination of how the communication mode is selected may be based on previous selections the first user and or second user has made in response to presentation of options to select. For example if the second user has selected email as the communication mode in 50 of the last 50 times the second user has been presented with an option to select a communication mode email may be automatically selected next time it appears as a high priority choice instead of presenting the second user an option and or a list of modes for selection. Additionally the second user may be enabled to select how future communication mode options are presented. For example when a list of the prioritized communication modes is presented the second user may also be provided with a mechanism to opt out of future options and request that the communication application automatically select the highest priority mode in future communication sessions.

Furthermore the communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between the first user and the second user . For example if the document from the word processing application that the first user is sharing with the second user is a large document comprising images graphics charts and or tables email messaging may be selected as the communication mode because the document may be too large to share via text messaging or instant messaging communication modes. The communication module of the communication mode may then be configured to initiate the communication session between the first user and the second user through the selected communication mode.

Existing solutions for selection of communication modes may offer the initiating user a choice of communication modes in a list however these solutions involve performance of an additional user selection step and often present communication modes that are unlikely to be selected. Automatic selection of a communication mode as described in the embodiments above may advantageously eliminate unlikely communication modes by removing the unused communication modes by one or both of the initiating user and target user. Furthermore automatic selection of the communication mode may advantageously anticipate future communication modes used between the initiating user and target user by prioritizing the remaining available communication modes.

In an example embodiment the first user an initiating user may request to initiate a communication session with the second user a target user through the presentation application . For example the first user may request to send a presentation document to the second user through the presentation application . The selection module of the communication application may be configured to detect the request to initiate the communication session from within the presentation application and determine available communication modes. The available communication modes may be determined based on the first user and or second user and or based on the network over which the first user and or second user are communicating.

The selection module may be configured to remove unused communication modes based on one or more removal criteria. The removal criteria may include lack of subscription to a service that provides the communication mode and a lack of login or lack of recent login to a subscription account using the communication mode by one or both of the first user and second user . For example if the first user and or the second user have not subscribed to a service or logged into a subscription account using an instant messaging communication mode the instant messaging communication mode may be removed.

The selection module may then be configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode based on one or more priority criteria where the selected communication mode may be video communication for example. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by the first user and or the second user and definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by the first user and or the second user . The priority criteria may also include a location and availability status of the first user and or the second user current use of the communication mode and capabilities of a device currently being used by the first user and or the second user .

In some embodiments a confidence level in the prioritization of the remaining available communication modes may be determined based on a ratio of priority criteria that correspond to a highest prioritized communication mode where a first and second threshold may be defined. In response to a determination that the confidence level is above a first threshold a highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode. In response to a determination that the confidence level is below the first threshold and above a second threshold a highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected with an option provided to the first user and or the second user to change the selected communication mode. In response to a determination that the confidence level is below the second threshold a list of the prioritized communication modes may be presented to the first user and or the second user for selection of the communication mode.

Furthermore the communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between the first user and the second user . For example for the document from the presentation application that the first user is sharing with the second user video communication may be selected as the communication mode such that the document may be visually displayed for presentation to the second user .

The communication module of the communication application may then be configured to initiate the communication session between the first user and the second user through the selected communication mode.

In an example embodiment the first user an initiating user may request to initiate a communication session with the second user a target user through the email calendar application . For example the first user may request to send a brief text based message to the second user through the email calendar application . The selection module may be configured to detect the request to initiate the communication session from within the email calendar application and determine available communication modes. In other examples the selection module of the communication application may be configured to detect the request to initiate the communication session from a user experience provided by the communication application .

The selection module may be configured to remove unused communication modes based one or more removal criteria. The removal criteria may include lack of subscription to a service that provides the communication mode and a lack of login or lack of recent login to a subscription account using the communication mode by one or both of the first user and second user . For example if the first user and or the second user have not subscribed to a service or logged into a subscription account using an audio communication mode the audio communication mode may be removed.

The selection module may then be configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode based on one or more priority criteria where the selected communication mode may be instant messaging for example. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by the first user and or the second user and definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by the first user and or the second user . The priority criteria may also include a location and availability status of the first user and or the second user current use of the communication mode and capabilities of a device currently being used by the first user and or the second user .

In some embodiments a confidence level in the prioritization of the remaining available communication modes may be determined based on a ratio of priority criteria that correspond to a highest prioritized communication mode where a first and a second threshold may be defined. In response to a determination that the confidence level is above a first threshold a highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode. In some examples an option may also be provided to the first user and or the second user to change the selected communication mode in response to a determination that the confidence level is below the first threshold and above a second threshold. In response to a determination that the confidence level is below the second threshold a list of the prioritized communication modes may be presented to the first user and or the second user for selection of the communication mode.

Furthermore the communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between the first user and the second user . For example for the brief text based message that the first user is sharing with the second user instant messaging or text messing may be selected as the communication mode as the message does not include large amounts of data that may difficult to send via these communications.

The communication module of the communication application may then be configured to initiate the communication session between the first user and the second user through the selected communication mode.

The initiating user and or the target user may subscribe to a communication application which may be a third party service or an integrated module of another service such as a coordinated application set or an application. A selection module of the communication application may be configured to detect the request to initiate the communication session from within the email calendar application and determine available communication modes. Available communication modes may include voice communication audio communication video communication email messaging instant messaging application sharing and data sharing. The available communication modes may be determined based on one or both of the initiating user and the target user and or a network over which the initiating user and the target user are communicating.

The selection module may be configured to remove unused communication modes. An unused communication mode may be identified for removal by determining whether the initiating user and the target user have subscribed to a service that provides the communication mode and whether the initiating user and the target user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode. If the initiating user and the target user have not subscribed to a service or logged into a subscription account using the communication mode the communication mode may be removed.

The selection module may then be configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode where the selected mode may be email messaging for example. In some embodiments a communication mode may be prioritized if the communication mode is used frequently by one or both of the initiating user and the target user and or is used frequently by the initiating user when communicating with the target user . For example the initiating user and the target user may both frequently use email messaging communication modes when communicating with other users and with each other. In other embodiments a communication mode may be prioritized if the communication mode has been explicitly defined as a selected communication mode by one or both of the initiating user and the target user . For example the target user may explicitly define email messaging as a selected communication mode.

In some examples a communication mode may be prioritized based on one or more of a location and an availability status of one or both of the initiating user and the target user . For example the availability status of the target user may indicate the target user is in a meeting and unavailable and accordingly the communication mode prioritized may include email messaging. In other examples a communication mode may be prioritized that one or both of the initiating user and the target user are currently using and or based on capabilities of a current device used by one or both of the initiating user and the target user . For example the initiating user may be currently using an email messaging mode through the email calendar application on a smart phone. Accordingly email messaging may be prioritized.

In some embodiments a confidence level in the prioritization of the remaining available communication modes may be determined based on a ratio of priority criteria that correspond to a highest prioritized communication mode where a first and second threshold may be defined. For example the first threshold may be 80 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes and the second threshold may be 40 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes.

In this scenario the confidence level may be 100 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes where the 100 represents all priority criteria corresponding to a highest prioritized highest prioritized communication mode the email messaging communication mode. Accordingly the confidence level may be above the first threshold. In response to a determination that the confidence level is above the first threshold the highest prioritized communication mode email messaging may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode.

Furthermore the communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between the initiating user and the target user . For example the reply message that the initiating user is communicating with the second user the target user may include one or more attachments and thus email messaging may be selected as the communication mode because the documents may be too large to share via text messaging or instant messaging communication modes. A communication module of the communication application may then be configured to initiate the communication session between the initiating user and the target user through the selected communication mode email messaging.

As shown in diagram A an initiating user may create a document through a presentation application where the presentation application may be executed on a client device such as a tablet. A user experience of the presentation application may preview one or more slides of the document adjacent to a current slide of the document being displayed. The initiating user may perform a user action which may include touch input gesture input voice command eye tracking gyroscopic input pen input mouse input and or keyboard input to select a communication control element . The communication control element may be located on the user experience of the presentation application and selection of the communication control element may indicate that the initiating user is requesting to initiate a communication session with a target user to share the document .

In response to selection of the communication control element a display element may be presented to the initiating user as shown in diagram B of . The display element may include a text based prompt such as Who would you like to communicate with and present a list of one or more users that may be selected as a target user. In some embodiments the display element may be a preview pane of an application that further includes a status and a device capability associated with each user presented in the list users . The preview pane may enable a user experience of the application to be visually displayed to the initiating user without having to switch the user experience to the user experience of the application for example. The initiating user may perform a user action to select the target user. For example the initiating user may select User as the target user as illustrated.

In response to selection of the target user a selection module of a communication application may be configured to determine available communication modes. The available communication modes may be determined based on one or both of the initiating and the target user and or based on the network over which the initiating and the target user are communicating. The available communication modes may include voice communication audio communication video communication email messaging instant messaging application sharing and or data sharing for example. The selection module may also be configured to remove one or more unused communication modes. An unused communication mode may be identified for removal by determining whether the initiating user and the target user have subscribed to a service that provides the communication mode and whether the initiating user and the target user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode ever and or recently.

The selection module may then be configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode based on one or more priority criteria. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user and definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user. The priority criteria may also include a location and availability status of the initiating user and or the target user current use of the communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user and capabilities of a device currently being used by the initiating user and or the target user. Furthermore the communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between the initiating user and the target user.

A confidence level in the prioritization of the remaining available communication modes may be determined based on a ratio of priority criteria that correspond to a highest prioritized communication mode where a first and second threshold may be defined. For example a first threshold may be 65 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes where at least 65 of the priority criteria correspond to a highest prioritized highest prioritized communication mode. A second confidence level threshold may be 35 confidence in prioritization of the remaining available communication modes where at least 35 of the priority criteria correspond to the highest prioritized highest prioritized communication mode.

In response to a determination that the confidence level is above the first threshold the highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode. In response to a determination that the confidence level is below the first threshold and above the second threshold the highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode and an option may be provided to the imitating user to change the selected communication mode as illustrated in configuration in diagram C of . For example in the configuration a display element may be displayed through the user experience of the presentation application in response to a determination that the confidence level is below the first threshold and above the second threshold. The display element may be a dialog box for example that includes a text based prompt such as The selected communication mode is video communication. Would you like to change the communication mode and presents options of yes or no to the initiating user for changing the selected communication mode. The initiating user may perform a user action to select no and a communication module may be configured to initiate the communication session between the initiating user and the target user using the video communication mode. In other examples the initiating user may select yes to change the selected communication mode.

In response to the initiating user selecting yes to change the selected communication mode or in response to a determination that the confidence level is below the second threshold a list of the prioritized communication modes may be presented to an initiating user for selection of the communication mode as further illustrated in configuration in diagram C of . For example in the configuration a display element may be displayed through the user experience of the presentation application . The display element may be a dialog box for example that includes a text based prompt such as Please select a communication mode from the following options to share this document with the target user and presents the list of the prioritized communication modes to the initiating user for selection of the communication mode. The initiating user may perform a user action which may select the communication mode video communication for example.

A communication module of the communication application may then automatically initiate the communication session between the initiating user and the target user through the selected communication mode as illustrated in diagram D of . For example upon confirmation and or selection of the video communication mode by the initiating user the communication module may initiate sharing of the document through a video conferencing feature of a messaging application . In some examples the document may be shared on a display screen of the video conferencing feature and a prompt indicating initiation of the communication session with the target user through the video communication mode may also be included on the display screen .

The selection module may also be configured to remove unused communication modes based on one or more removal criteria . An unused communication mode may be identified for removal by determining whether the initiating user and the target user have subscribed to a service that provides the communication mode and whether the initiating user and the target user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode. Accordingly the removal criteria may include a lack of subscription to a service that provides the communication mode and a lack of login or lack of recent login to a subscription account using the communication mode by one or both of the initiating and target users.

The selection module may be further configured to prioritize remaining communication modes based on one or more priority criteria to select a communication mode. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user and definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user.

The examples in have been described using specific network environments systems services applications and processes to provide a relevant communication mode selection. Embodiments to provide a relevant communication mode selection are not limited to the specific network environments systems services applications and processes according to these examples.

Automatic selection of a communication mode as described in the embodiments above may eliminate unlikely communication modes by removing the unused communication modes by one or both of the initiating user and target user from selection. Furthermore automatic selection of the communication mode may anticipate future communication mode use between the initiating user and target user by prioritizing the remaining available communication modes to select a communication mode. Accordingly automatic selection of the communication mode may advantageously improve usability and increase a processing speed by eliminating unlikely communication modes and eliminating additional user selection processing steps.

Process begins with operation where a selection module of a communication session may be configured to determine available communication modes in response to detecting a request from an initiating user to initiate a communication session with a target user. The available communication modes may be determined based on one or both of the initiating and the target user and or the network over which the initiating and the target user are communicating. The available communication modes may include voice communication audio communication video communication email messaging instant messaging application sharing and or data sharing for example.

At operation the selection module may be configured to remove one or more unused communication modes. An unused communication mode may be identified for removal by determining whether the initiating user and the target user have subscribed to a service that provides the communication mode and whether the initiating user and the target user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode. For example if the initiating user and the target user have not subscribed to a service or logged into a subscription account using the communication mode the communication mode may be removed.

At operation the selection module may prioritize remaining available communication modes to select a communication modes based on one or more priority criteria. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user and definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user. The priority criteria may also include a location and availability status of the initiating user and or the target user current use of the communication mode by the initiating user and or the target user and capabilities of a device currently being used by the initiating user and or the target user. Furthermore the communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between the initiating user and the target user.

At operation a communication module of the communication application my automatically initiate the communication session between the initiating user and the target user through the selected communication mode.

The communication application may be configured to in response to detection of a request to initiate a communication session through a user interface associated with an application determine available communication modes and remove one or more unused communication modes where an unused communication mode for removal is identified by determining whether an initiating user and a target user subscribed to a service that provides a communication mode and or whether the initiating user and the target user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode. The communication application may be further configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to determine a selected communication mode where a communication mode that is used frequently by one or both of the initiating user and the target user and a communication mode that is used frequently by the initiating user when communicating with the target user is prioritized and automatically initiate the communication session through the selected communication mode.

In other embodiments an unused communication mode may be identified for removal by determining whether an initiating user and a target user subscribed to a service that provides a communication mode and or whether the initiating user and the target user have logged into a subscription account using the communication mode. A communication mode that is used frequently by one or both of an initiating user and a target user and or a communication mode that is used frequently by the initiating user when communicating with the target user may be prioritized. A communication mode that one or both of an initiating user and a target user have explicitly defined as a selected communication mode may be prioritized. A communication mode based on one or more of a location and an availability status of one or both of an initiating user and a target user may be prioritized. A communication mode that one or both of an initiating user and a target user are currently using may be prioritized. A communication mode based on capabilities of a device used by one or both of an initiating user and a target user may be prioritized. The communication mode may be selected based on a type of content to be shared between an initiating user and a target user.

In further embodiments a confidence level in the prioritization of the remaining communication modes may be determined. A highest prioritized communication mode may be automatically selected as the selected communication mode in response to a determination that the confidence level is above a first threshold. An option may be provided to one or both of an initiating user and a target user to change the selected communication mode in response to a determination that the confidence level is below a first threshold and above a second threshold. A list of the prioritized communication modes may be presented to one or both of an initiating user and a target user for selection of the communication mode in response to a determination that the confidence level is below a second threshold.

The communication application may be configured to in response to detection of a request to initiate a communication session from within one of the application provided by the first server or a user experience provided by the communication application determine available communication modes and remove one or more unused communication modes based on one or more removal criteria. The communication application may be further configured to prioritize remaining available communication modes to determine a selected communication mode based on one or more priority criteria and automatically initiate the communication session through the selected communication mode.

In other examples the first server and the second server may be managed by separate entities that communicate via application programming interfaces APIs . The removal criteria may include lack of a subscription by one or both of an initiating user and a target user to a service that provides a communication mode and or lack of login to a subscription account using the communication mode by one or both of the initiating user and the target user. The priority criteria may include frequent use of the communication mode by one or both of an initiating user and a target user definition of the communication mode as the selected communication mode by one or both of the initiating user and the target user an availability status of one or both of the initiating user and the target user current use of the communication mode by one or both of the initiating user and the target user capabilities of a device currently being used by one or both of the initiating user and the target user and or a type of content to be shared between the initiating user and the target user.
