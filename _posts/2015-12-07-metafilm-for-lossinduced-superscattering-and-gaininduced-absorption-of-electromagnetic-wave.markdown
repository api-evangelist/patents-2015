title: Metafilm for loss-induced super-scattering and gain-induced absorption of electromagnetic wave
abstract: A metafilm is provided for operating on a photon at a defined wavelength, for super-scattering, absorption, and for laser absorber switch. The metafilm includes dimers and a conductive substrate for embedding the dimers in an array. Each dimer comprises a pair of a gain element and a loss element. The substrate, and the gain and loss elements have complex permittivity values. The metafilm super-scatters (e.g., lases) the photon in response to increasing the imaginary component of either the substrate or the loss element, and absorbs the photon in response to increasing the imaginary component of the gain element.

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 the benefit of priority from provisional application 62 090 590 with a filing date of Dec. 11 2014 is claimed for this non provisional application.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to electromagnetic amplification. In particular the invention involves substrate dissipation and an array of dimers in which a dimer is defined as a structure formed from a complementary pair of similar sub units. Each dimer is composed of one loss element and one gain element. The loss and gain elements have the same geometry and the same real part of the permittivity but the opposite imaginary part of the permittivity.

In a pioneering work Bender and colleagues proved that non Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity time symmetry may exhibit entirely real spectrum below a phase transition symmetry breaking point. See C. M. Bender et al. Real Spectra in Non Hermitian Hamiltonians having PT Symmetry 80 5243 1998 and C. M. Bender et al. Complex Extension of Quantum Mechanics 89 270401 2002 . Inspired by this emerging concept in the past decade there has been a growing interest in studying symmetric Hamiltonian in the framework of optics where the complex potential in quantum mechanics is translated into a complex electrical permittivity profile satisfying r r in optical systems.

In optics most of the symmetric structures are realized by parallel waveguides or media with alternating gain and loss either along or across the propagation direction. The periodic spatial modulation of gain and loss in photonics and plasmonics structures has led to many intriguing phenomena such as nonreciprocal light propagation and invisibility power oscillations coherent perfect absorptions loss induced transparency nonreciprocal Bloch oscillations optical switching unidirectional tunneling loss free negative refraction and laser absorbers.

The symmetric systems are a subset of open quantum systems for which the Hamiltonian is non Hermitian and the eigenvalues are complex in general. The unique properties associated with non Hermitian Hamiltonian are exceptional points and spectral singularities one being a branch point singularity associated with level repulsion and symmetry breaking. The existence of the exceptional point has been observed in microwave experiments. See S. Longhi Spectral singularities and Bragg scattering of complex crystals 81 022102 2010 and M. G. Moharam et al. Rigorous coupled wave analysis of planar grating diffraction 71 811 1981 . Spectral singularity is related to scattering resonance of non Hermitian Hamiltonian and manifests itself as giant transmission and reflection with vanishing bandwidth. Exceptional points and spectral singularities possess interesting electromagnetic properties and have attracted much attention.

Conventional schemes for electromagnetic amplification yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a high gain metafilm for super scattering absorbing and laser absorber switching. A metafilm is provided for operating on a photon at a wavelength including an electrically conductive substrate and a plurality of dimers. The substrate has a planar surface a sub wavelength thickness and a first complex permittivity. The dimers are disposed in a planar array on the planar surface. Each dimer has a sub wavelength period and includes loss and gain elements separated by a sub wavelength distance. Each element has a sub wavelength span and a sub wavelength width along said planar array. The loss element has a second complex permittivity. The gain element has a third complex permittivity.

The first second and third complex permittivities respectively include first second and third real components and respectively include first second and third imaginary components. The second and third real components are equal. The second imaginary component is higher than the third imaginary component. In response to increasing either the first imaginary component or the second imaginary component the metafilm super scatters the photon. In response to increasing the third imaginary component the metafilm absorbs the photon. In response to increasing the third imaginary component the metafilm switches from photon release to photon absorption by increasing the third imaginary component. In response to increasing the secondary imaginary component the metafilm switches from photon absorption to photon release.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Exemplary embodiments provide techniques for symmetric loss induced lasing also called super scattering and gain induced absorption as described in Loss induced super scattering and gain induced absorption accepted for publication in . The term loss refers to dissipation from adjusting the imaginary portion of the permittivity that is greater than zero. The inventive concepts contrast with conventional processes for loss induced absorption and gain induced amplification.

Amplified transmission and reflection of a finite bandwidth are shown to occur at the same wavelength when the electromagnetic wave is incident on a periodic array of symmetric dimers embedded in a metallic film. Remarkably this phenomenon vanishes if the metallic substrate is lossless while other parameters remain unchanged. When the metafilm is adjusted to the vicinity of a spectral singularity tuning substrate dissipation to a critical value can lead to supper scattering in stark contrast to that expected in conventional systems.

The synthetic plasmonic metafilm acts as a lasing spaser a planar source of coherent radiation. The metallic dissipation provides means to couple light out of the dark modes of the spaser. Above a critical gain loss coupling the metafilm behaves as a meta gain medium with the meta gain atoms composed from plasmonic dimers. This phenomenon implies that super radiation is possible from a cavity that has gain elements by tuning the cavity dissipation to a critical value. Another technique for enabling the synthetic plasmonic metafilm to become a laser is by tuning the loss element of the dimers near the exceptional point EP . The synthetic plasmonic metafilm can also become an absorber by tuning the gain element of the dimers near the EP. Similarly the synthetic plasmonic metafilm can also become a laser absorber switch by tuning the loss and gain elements near the EP.

Parity time synthetic materials represent a novel class of metamaterials with novel electromagnetic properties arising from a delicate balance between loss and gain elements. Global symmetry is a demanding condition. Systems with local symmetry are easier to implement than global. An array of symmetric dimers in which each gain loss pair possesses local symmetry with respect to its own center enables emission in the real spectrum in the desired parameter region. Except for compensating loss with gain active plasmonic materials offer an ideal platform for studying non Hermitian Hamiltonian in the electromagnetic domain at the sub wavelength scale.

Most studies on symmetric structures employ analytical models based on either one dimensional scalar Helmholtz equation or two dimensional scalar paraxial wave equation. For plasmonic metamaterials having sub wavelength meta atoms as resonators the above analytical descriptions are not applicable. Nevertheless the plasmonic metafilms are complex quantum systems with strong coupling and in general can be described by non Hermitian Hamiltonian.

The spaser concept proposed by Bergman et al. in Surface Plasmon Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation 90 2 027402 has led to Zheludev et al. in Lasing Spacer 2 351 354 suggesting lasing spaser fueled from the dark modes of the spaser via structural symmetry breaking. Experiments towards this concept have been reported. This disclosure examines electromagnetic properties of synthetic plasmonic metafilm which is composed of a planar array of coupled symmetric dimers. The exemplary structure can exhibit the super scattering effect by control of plasmonic substrate dissipation in both forward and backward directions. Steering the metafilm to the vicinity of a singular region of the system while tuning the substrate dissipation to a critical value can produce substantially amplified waves radiated from both sides of the metafilm. The exemplary device behaves as a lasing spaser. The large gain is drawn from the dark modes of the spaser via metallic dissipation which breaks the symmetry and couples light out of the spaser.

Theoretical Approach In view a symmetric dimer represents a unit cell composed of gain and loss sub wavelength elements embedded within the thin metafilm . The dimers and the metafilm have the same thickness i.e. the metallic mesh is filled with gain loss elements. The unit cell repeats in the x y plane with the same period in both directions to form the array.

The dimer elements and have complex permittivity values as does the metafilm . The real coefficient of the relative permittivity of the loss and gain elements is fixed at 3.6 throughout the disclosure. The imaginary coefficient varies but satisfies 2 to ensure the local symmetry. The permeability is unity 1 for all the materials. The period p 3.5 m the dimer length a 2.5 m and width b 1.0 m are fixed throughout the disclosure. However the device functions are not limited by these values which merely provide an example for demonstration. The general expression of the complex conjugate permittivity for the gain and loss elements is given by 3 is such that the condition 0 represents the loss element and 

For infrared synthetic materials the dispersion of metal aluminum Al in this case cannot be neglected. For a harmonic time dependence as exp i t for electromagnetic field the permittivity of Al was obtained by curve fitting experimental data with a Drude model 

The form of eqn. 7 can handle uniaxial anisotropic materials with the optical axis along the z direction. The Hamiltonian given by eqn. 7 is non Hermitian. The scattering and transfer matrices and respectively as well as the transmittance and the reflectance are calculated numerically. The transfer matrix which connects the field at the output and the input surfaces is defined as 

The relationship between the transfer and scattering matrices in this case is given by the relations 12 13 14 15 where the Sand Sare respectively the reflection and transmission coefficients of the electric field. Note that reflection involves eqn. 12 and transmission involves eqn. 13 . The relative permittivity of the loss gain dielectric materials 3.6 1 i0.06 is a complex conjugate.

In general the transfer and scattering matrices are multidimensional due to multiple scattering channels. Extensive numerical studies have confirmed that for the exemplary geometry the magnitudes of the higher order and cross polarization scatterings are much smaller than that of the first order event due to the sub wavelength nature of the films. Therefore the transfer and scattering matrices can be reduced to 2 2 matrices. The problem can be effectively described in a two dimensional space.

The symmetry of the structure requires the relationship 19 and . 20 A bi orthogonality test for the eigenvectors can be written 0. 21 These two conditions have also been confirmed numerically under various conditions. By using these conditions the eigenvalues of the scattering matrix can be derived as 

The transfer and scattering matrices and their eigenvalues are useful tools for the analysis of the spectral singularities. The eigenfunctions of the non Hermitian Hamiltonian satisfy bi orthogonal relationship. The right hand eigenvectors of the transfer matrix are given by 

Many parameters can be changed regarding the geometry of the cell . In exemplary embodiments the period p 3.5 m of the square array the size a b 2.5 1.0 m of the dimers and the real part of the relative permittivity 3.6 of the dimers are fixed throughout the disclosure at values shorter than the wavelength of the light emitted or absorbed and thus have sub wavelength dimensions. The electric field E is shown incident at angle to the x y plane.

Transmittance and reflectance of the normal incidence wave on a lossless metafilm are plotted versus wavelength in the upper panel or graph and thickness in the lower panel with the electric field E parallel to the shorter edge of the dimers .

Without dissipation variations mirror each other along a range of about an order of magnitude. With dissipation both transmittance and reflectance spike at wavelength of 8.9 m and thickness of 1.927 m. The transfer matrix magnitudes without dissipation in lower left panels and show a spike for both values at wavelength of 8.86 m and thickness of 1.952 m while with dissipation in the lower right panels and the M magnitude reduces to zero for wavelength at 8.9 m and thickness at 1.926 m and the M magnitude approaches a minimum beyond a wavelength of about 9.1 m and a thickness of about 1.94 m.

Upper panels and show transmittance solid and reflectance dash versus the thickness of the metafilm at the wavelength 6 m that corresponds to the normal incidence with the electric field parallel to the shorter edge of the dimers . The corresponding analysis of the transfer matrix elements is provided in the lower panels and . The separation of the two elements is x 0.5 m.

The lower left panel illustrates the phases for scattering matrix eigenvalues and . The upper right panel illustrates the phases for transfer matrix eigenvalues and . These correspond to the condition of . The eigenvalues of the scattering matrix diverges with a phase jump solid at the wavelength 8.92 m where the super scattering occurs.

For both transmittance and reflectance at 1.91 m thickness in panels and the peak amplitude and phase inflection occur at wavelength of 5.97 m. For both transmittance and reflectance at 1.96 m thickness in panels and the peak amplitude and phase inflection occur at wavelength of 6.04 m. This shows complementary adjustment of highly detectable shifts with thickness and wavelength.

Super scattering View in shows the transmittance T and reflectance R of a normal incident electromagnetic wave onto a lossless metafilm with lossless dimers . The frequency dependent permittivity of Al was taken from the real part of Drude model given by eqn. 4 . In the lossless case T R 1 energy conservation which is clearly demonstrated in . An increase of the transmission is accompanied by a decrease of the reflection and vice versa. The peaks and valleys of the transmittance and the reflectance repeat periodically with the variation of the thickness of the film. The metafilm behaves effectively like a low Q Fabry P rot cavity below 9 m. The upper and lower surfaces of the metafilm serve as the reflection mirrors of the Fabry P rot cavity while the thickness of the metafilm serves as the length of the cavity. Above 12 m the metafilm behaves towards a perfect electric conductor PEC .

The EM scattering is investigated from a plasmonic thin film having balanced gain loss elements. The synthetic plasmonic metafilm no longer behaves as a Fabry P rot cavity. To demonstrate the effect of the substrate dissipation the transmittance and reflectance of the metafilm is investigated with and without plasmonic dissipation in the presence of the balanced gain loss dimers . The upper left panel in shows the transmittance and reflectance of the EM wave normally incident on the synthetic lossless plasmonic metafilm of which the dispersion is given by the real part of Drude model in eqn. 4 . The relative permittivity of the loss gain dimers is given by 3.6 1 i0.06 .

Clearly the sum of the transmittance and reflectance is close to unity i.e. T R 1. Overall the metafilm performs as a conventional lossless medium where the maximum transmission is accompanied by the minimum reflection and vice versa. This behavior can be understood as the sub wavelength dimers have balanced gain loss profile and are embedded in the metafilm as a lossless substrate .

The situation changes dramatically when the plasmonic substrate dissipation is taken into account as shown in the upper right panel of where the giant transmittance and reflectance occur at the same wavelength unlike conventional media where one increases at the expense of the other. This peculiar property can be analyzed through the scattering parameters Sand Sthat have a common denominator Mas shown by eqns. 12 and 13 .

When the denominator of Sand Svanishes both transmittance and reflectance approach infinity as long as Mis finite. The lower panels and in show the magnitude of Mand Mwith and without the substrate dissipation described by the Drude model in eqn. 4 . Without the substrate dissipation in the lower left panel both magnitude of Mand Mare large at the wavelength about 8.88 m which explains the null in the transmittance and the peak in the reflectance in the upper left panel . Upon activation of substrate dissipation in the lower right panel the magnitude M vanishes at the wavelength about 8.92 m whereas the magnitude M is finite. Thus both transmission and reflection approach infinity.

Here the spectral singularities are manifested as the dissipation induced super scattering. This dissipation induced super scattering is also observed when varying the thickness of the metafilm at the fixed wavelength 6 m as illustrated in the upper panels and of with the corresponding analysis of the transfer matrix elements given in the lower panels and of .

Without the substrate dissipation the metafilm behaves as a conventional medium where the peak of the transmittance is accompanied by the valley of the reflectance and vice versa in the upper left panel . The production of gain and loss is balanced. The plasmonic substrate dissipation induces over production of gain leading to super scattering in both forward and backward directions in the upper right panel . As shown in the lower right panel of the singular behavior is related to the vanishing of the transfer matrix element M solid the common denominator of Sand S.

The spectral singularity and the associated giant scattering is a signature of non Hermitian Hamiltonian of the gain medium. From eqn. 18 when M 0 the scatter eigenvalue above unity diverges and the scatter eigenvalue below unity remains finite i.e. 

This singularity is demonstrated as view in . Here the scattering eigenvalues are displayed in the solid curve in the upper left panel and the transfer eigenvalues are displayed in the solid curve in the upper right panel. A similar singularity is shown for matrices with the simulation condition corresponding to that of view in . There is also a phase jump for the diverged eigenvalue shown as the solid curve in the lower left panel . The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix satisfy the condition 1 from eqn. 18 with one magnitude greater than unity and the other less than unity corresponding to the amplification and decay modes respectively.

The relationship 1 from eqn. 18 has been tested for various parameters with and without the substrate dissipation. Unlike the zero bandwidth resonance in the longitudinal symmetric structures the super scattering in this geometry with the transverse local symmetry has a finite bandwidth which is easier to demonstrate experimentally and opens up various potential applications.

The coexistence of super transmission and reflection is a manifestation of the resonant state of the complex scattering potential one of the essential features of non Hermitian Hamiltonian with gain. This phenomenon is fundamentally different from the geometric related resonances. The spectral singularity induced resonance resides in a localized region of a multidimensional parameter space of the system as implied in which show the super scattering respectively at the wavelength 8.92 m and at the thickness of 1.927 m versus the geometric parameters and the loss tangents of the metal substrate and dimers. At the super scattering the transmitted and reflected electric fields experience a phase shift across the singularity as shown in for the respectively specified wavelength and thickness.

Adding the substrate dissipation is equivalent to introducing loss into the cavity. The dissipation provides a coupling mechanism for the spaser to radiate into the far field. Without the dissipation the spaser cannot lase and behaves as a lossless thin film. The spaser generates strong coherent local field but the photons are trapped inside the dark modes which cannot radiate without a proper coupling mechanism. Here the loss is introduced into the cavity as metallic dissipation which naturally enters the plasmonic dark modes and turns them into radiative modes and thus releases the trapped photons.

The top and bottom surfaces of the metafilm provide the required feedback for lasing. This feedback mechanism is observable from that shows the Fabry P rot cavity effect. The metafilm as a whole functions as a high quality active resonator. The spaser is coupled to the far field through transforming dark modes into radiative modes by metallic dissipation of the metafilm .

Numerical studies indicate that super scattering occurs in the vicinity of an exceptional point EP . In the absence of substrate dissipation the metafilm satisfies symmetry with balanced gain and loss arranged in the anti symmetric distribution of the imaginary portion of the permittivity. The two eigenstates are forward and backward waves. Their constructive and destructive interferences modify transmission and reflection as well as lasing and absorption. An EP is characterized by coalescence of both eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors thereby reducing the system to one dimension. exemplifies wavelength variation of the eigenvalues and associated eigen functions in the neighborhood of the EP indicated by the bifurcation point at wavelength 8.968 m where both eigen parameters coalesce.

The presence of such an EP can have a dramatic effect on the EM property of the system. Around the EP lasing can be induced either by adding substrate dissipation or else by increasing the loss of the dimers without adding the substrate dissipation. The former effect of adding substrate dissipation effect is shown in . The latter effect of increasing the dimer loss is shown in for the transmission coefficient at different dimer losses with a fixed gain. The transmission increases with increasing loss until reaching a maximum where lasing occurs at a loss of 0.43.

The corresponding poles of a scattering matrix in a complex wavelength plane is shown in for different losses of the dimers . Increasing the loss moves the pole up towards the real axis. Lasing occurs when the pole reaches the real axis i.e. 0. In a similar vein gain induced infrared absorption around the EP is shown in by varying gain of the dimers with a fixed loss. The numerical study indicates that maximum absorption can be achieved for a gain at 0.5. Negative absorption can result from the net gain.

Without substrate dissipation the sum of transmittance and reflectance remains unity and the net amplification is zero in the output signals. The periodic dimers provide an array of twin resonators on the metafilm that serves as the substrate. An incident wave with the electric field E parallel to the short edge of the rectangular elements that can excite a localized cavity mode inside the element. The synthetic design sustains a localized gain type plasmon and loss type plasmon within a unit cell. The substrate dissipation can modify the waveguide mode of the substrate and transform the dark mode of the substrate into the radiative mode as shown in . Hence the dissipation provides a mechanism to couple light out of the system and the synthetic medium behaves as a planar source of coherent radiation. These elements as dimers can constitute holes in the metafilm .

An array of sub wavelength holes in the metallic substrate i.e. metafilm supports surface plasmon resonances. shows the real and imaginary portions of the normalized mode propagation constant in the absence of dissipation. This shows a complex propagation constant as dash lines with the effective mode index greater than unity and thus cannot be accessed from the free space. Therefore the photons are trapped in the dark mode. When adding substrate dissipation the mode propagation constant becomes real and less than unity shown by the solid lines . This mode can be excited by a free space plane wave. Consequently when this mode is lased the structure will radiate into the far field. The dark mode of the metafilm in the absence of the dissipation becomes the radiative mode which can couple to the external field in the presence of the dissipation. The points coincide with the radiative branch lines indicating that super scattering results from exciting and lasing to the radiative plasmonic mode. This radiative branch can be accessed by a free space plane wave such as for transmission as a function of wavelength for different incident angles as shown for similar conditions in .

Substrate dissipation provides a technique to couple radiation of the synthetic metafilm into the far field. With super scattering the transmitted and reflected electric field experiences a phase shift which is typical behavior at the resonance. In the absence of dissipation the photons remain trapped in the dark modes that cannot radiate without a proper coupling mechanism. The substrate dissipation breaks the symmetry and transforms the dark mode into the radiative mode so as to couple the light out of the metafilm to release the trapped photons.

The EP related phenomena such as resonant frequency are sensitive to the parameters of these systems. Therefore the EP offers a preferred mechanism for low threshold or fast switch. This can be applied to an ultra sensitive sensor to detect small variation of the parameter. The upper panels and in show transmission and reflection of the normally incident wave at different thicknesses of the metafilm . The lasing frequency can be tuned by a small variation of the thickness while maintaining other parameters unchanged.

The interplay between loss and gain can enable loss induced lasing and gain induced absorption in the synthetic plasmonic metafilm near the EP. The super scattering has a finite bandwidth that increases the possibility of detecting resonance related to a spectral singularity. The scattering property of an optical system can be controlled by background dissipation. Adding substrate dissipation is equivalent to introducing loss into a cavity. Exemplary embodiments provide a strategy to control the phase of symmetry using background loss and to control the radiation of the dimer using cavity dissipation. The effect of introducing gain into materials provides more than loss compensation. The interplay between loss and gain can transform the synthetic metafilm into a laser or absorber. This exemplary device can also be designed as a laser absorber switch.

This disclosure demonstrates a new type of plasmonic laser and absorber based on the symmetry lasing spaser and gain induced absorber. The super scattering has a finite bandwidth that increases the detection possibility for spectral singularity related resonances. The exemplary result implies that the scattering properties of optical systems may be controlled by the background dissipation and thereby provides a new strategy to control the phase of the symmetry using the background loss and to control the super radiation from a cavity by tuning the cavity dissipation.

The effect of introducing gain into materials is more than loss compensation. The interplay between the loss and gain surface plasmons in the dimers leads to the meta gain atoms surface plasmon dimers which transform the synthetic metafilm into a meta gain medium. The exemplary embodiments exhibiting effective responses demonstrate capabilities of practical synthetic materials. The phase jump of the electric field at the super scattering can be used to design a two state system a new modulation scheme and potentially manipulating light in free space using the concept of symmetry. The narrowband resonant thin films enable applications in designs for notch filter sensor and optical switch.

It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
