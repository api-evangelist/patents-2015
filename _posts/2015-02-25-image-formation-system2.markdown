This application claims priority based on 35 USC 119 from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2014 038313 filed on Feb. 28 2014 entitled IMAGE FORMATION SYSTEM the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Conventionally when an image formation apparatus rejects printing of a print job received from a user terminal via a network due to print function restriction the image formation apparatus sends a response indicating the above status to the user terminal by using a bidirectional communication function of the network. Then the user terminal analyzes the status in the response from the image formation apparatus by using software and notifies a user of an analysis result that the printing has failed due to function restriction see Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2012 248123 for example .

However if software in a cloud or Internet environment does not support bidirectional communications or if the software of the user terminal cannot analyze the format of the status in the response from the image formation apparatus the user terminal cannot notify the user of the result of the response from the image formation apparatus and therefore the user cannot know why the printing has failed.

During an event such as a startup of mobile terminal for example log on information is inputted via input unit and display unit and is stored in storage unit .

Screen data is data necessary to display screens on display unit . For example screen data includes commands and data of partial images to generate screen data for displaying the screens on display unit .

Print data is image formation data based on which printer is to make printing image formation . Print data is generated by controller unit .

Controller unit controls processing in mobile terminal . Controller unit includes printer driver unit and receiver unit .

Printer driver unit generates a print job image formation job based on which printer is to make printing and sends the print job to printer . Printer driver unit includes print data generator unit as an image formation data generator unit user ID acquisition unit as a user identification information acquisition unit mail address input unit as an address input unit mail address acquisition unit as an address acquisition unit data adder unit as a job generator unit and print job output unit as an image formation job output unit.

Print data generator unit generates print data based on which printer is to make printing. Print data generator unit stores the generated print data in storage unit . User ID acquisition unit acquires the user ID as the user identification information. For example using an application programming interface API of an operation system OS user ID acquisition unit acquires the user ID from log on information stored in storage unit .

Mail address input unit receives input of a mail address which is an address of mobile terminal . For example mail address input unit receives input of the mail address from the user of mobile terminal via display unit and input unit . Specifically mail address input unit causes display unit to display mail address input screen IM as illustrated in by using screen data stored in storage unit . Then mail address input unit receives the mail address inputted on mail address input screen IM by using input unit and stores the mail address in storage unit . In this way mail address is stored in storage unit .

Mail address acquisition unit acquires the mail address of mobile terminal . For example mail address acquisition unit acquires mail address stored in storage unit .

Data adder unit generates a print job image formation job by adding the user ID acquired by user ID acquisition unit and mail address acquired by mail address acquisition unit to print data generated by print data generator unit .

Returning to the description of print job output unit sends the print job generated by data adder unit to printer . For example print job output unit causes communication unit to transmit the print job generated by data adder unit .

Receiver unit receives electronic mails e mails . For example receiver unit receives an e mail received by communication unit . Then when input unit receives input of a display instruction from the user of mobile terminal receiver unit causes display unit to display the content of the received e mail.

Communication unit performs communications with Internet . Here communication unit transmits and receives information to and from Internet through wireless communications.

Mobile terminal described hereinabove can be implemented for example by a computer including a CPU Central Processing Unit a RAM Random Access Memory an external storage device such as a ROM Read Only Memory an input device and a display device such as a touch panel and a communication device for Internet connection.

For example storage unit can be implemented by the CPU using the RAM or the external storage device. Controller unit can be implemented by the CPU loading a predetermined program stored in the external storage device onto the RAM and executing the loaded program. Input unit can be implemented by the CPU using the input device. Display unit can be implemented by the CPU using the display device. Communication unit can be implemented by the CPU using the communication device. It should be noted however that mobile terminal in Embodiment 1 is not limited to one implemented in software on a computer system. For example mobile terminal may be one implemented in hardware by an integrated logic IC such as ASICs Application Specific Integrated Circuits or FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array or may be one implemented in software by DSP Digital Signal Processor or the like.

Storage unit stores information necessary for processing in printer . For example storage unit stores print function restriction table and determination waiting print job file .

Print function restriction table is print function restriction information image formation function restriction information indicating a condition under which printing is restricted for each user ID.

Print function restriction table includes user ID column and restriction column for color printing availability . User ID column stores user IDs. Restriction column for color printing availability stores color printing availability information which indicates whether or not color printing is available to a user identified with each user ID stored in user ID column . For example if available is stored in restriction column for color printing availability the user identified with the user ID correspondingly stored in user ID column is permitted to make color printing. On the other hand if unavailable is stored in restriction column for color printing availability the user identified with the user ID correspondingly stored in user ID column is not permitted to make color printing.

Returning the explanation of determination waiting print job file is a file storing print job which waits for controller unit to make authentication.

Controller unit controls processing in printer . Controller unit includes receiver unit authentication determination unit as a determination unit authentication result transmitter unit as a notification information transmitter unit and print processor unit as an image formation processor unit.

Receiver unit receives print job . For example receiver unit receives print job received by communication unit . Then receiver unit acquires user ID and mail address from received print job and stores received print job as determination waiting print job file in storage unit .

Authentication determination unit determines whether or not to impose restriction on processing of print job . For example authentication determination unit determines whether or not print data contained in print job is printable. Specifically on the basis of user ID and print data contained in print job authentication determination unit refers to print function restriction table stored in storage unit and determines whether or not the print function to be used is restricted.

Authentication result transmitter unit generates notification information concerning print job and sends the generated notification information to the address contained in print job . For example if authentication determination unit determines that printing of a print job is unavailable image formation is unavailable authentication result transmitter unit transmits the notification information indicating the determination result in the form of an e mail from communication unit to the mail address contained in the print job determined as printing unavailable. For example as presented in authentication result transmitter unit generates as an e mail notification information indicating the resultant printing unavailable status and the explanation of the print restriction the reason why the printing is determined as unavailable and transmits the e mail from communication unit . In other words the notification information in Embodiment 1 is information indicating the reason why restriction is imposed on the processing of print job and the explanation of the restriction.

Returning to the description of if authentication determination unit determines that the printing is available print processor unit causes print unit to make the printing based determination waiting print job file storing print job determined as printing available. On the other hand if authentication determination unit determines that the printing is unavailable print processor unit deletes from storage unit determination waiting print job file storing print job determined as printing unavailable.

Storage unit controller unit and communication unit described above can be implemented by for example a CPU a RAM an external storage device such as a ROM and a communication device for Internet connection.

For example storage unit can be implemented by the CPU using the RAM or the external storage device. Controller unit can be implemented by the CPU loading a predetermined program stored in the external storage device onto the RAM and executing the loaded program. Communication unit can be implemented by the CPU using the communication device.

When input unit of mobile terminal receives an instruction from the user printer driver unit performs print processing. Firstly print data generator unit generates print data S . Print data generator unit stores generated print data in storage unit .

Next data adder unit reads print data from storage unit and generates print job by adding the user ID and mail address to print data S .

Receiver unit of printer receives print job via communication unit acquires user ID and mail address contained in received print job and stores received print job as determination waiting print job file in storage unit . Then authentication determination unit determines the print function restriction on the basis of the user ID and print data acquired from print job S . Here it is assumed that authentication determination unit determines that the printing is unavailable.

Authentication result transmitter unit generates an e mail indicating the result of the determination made by authentication determination unit for example the printing unavailable status and the information of the print function restriction and transmits the e mail from communication unit to mail address acquired from print job S .

Print processor unit cancels the printing and deletes determination waiting print job file determined as printing unavailable from storage unit S .

Meanwhile receiver unit of mobile terminal receives the e mail via communication unit and causes display unit to display the content of the e mail in response to an instruction from the user S . Thus the user of mobile terminal can check the determination result of the print function restriction for the print job.

The flowchart presented in is started in response to an event where input unit receives a print execution instruction from the user.

User ID acquisition unit acquires the user ID of the user who currently logs on from log on information stored in storage unit by using the API function of the OS S .

Mail address input unit causes display unit to display mail address input screen IM illustrated in based on screen data stored in storage unit and receives input of the mail address from the user via input unit S . Mail address input unit stores the inputted mail address in storage unit .

Mail address acquisition unit acquires mail address inputted by the user on mail address input screen IM and stored in storage unit S .

Print data generator unit generates print data through a certain known process S . Print data generator unit stores the generated print data in storage unit .

Data adder unit reads print data from storage unit and generates print job by adding the user ID acquired in step S and mail address acquired in step S to print data S .

Print job output unit outputs print job generated in step S to printer from communication unit via Internet S .

Receiver unit determines whether or not communication unit receives print job S . If print job is received Yes in S the processing proceeds to a user ID acquisition process in step S.

Thereafter receiver unit stores received print job as determination waiting print job file in storage unit S .

Next authentication determination unit performs a search process on print function restriction table S . Specifically authentication determination unit searches print function restriction table presented in by using user ID acquired in step S as a key and thereby acquires the information on the color printing availability associated with user ID

Then authentication determination unit determines whether or not to restrict the printing on the basis of determination waiting print job file stored in step S and the color printing availability information acquired in step S S . Here if the print data contained in determination waiting print job file stored in step S is data for color printing and if the color printing availability information acquired in step S indicates that the color printing is not permitted authentication determination unit determines that the printing is restricted. In other cases authentication determination unit determines that the printing is not restricted. If the printing is determined as restricted printing unavailable the processing proceeds to step S. On the other hand if the printing is determined as not restricted printing available the processing proceeds to step S.

In step S print processor unit deletes determination waiting print job file for which the printing is determined as restricted in step S from storage unit .

Authentication result transmitter unit generates an e mail including text indicating the printing unavailable status and the explanation of the restriction of the authentication result. Then authentication result transmitter unit outputs the generated e mail from communication unit to the mail address acquired in step S S . Here the output process of the e mail uses any known technique.

On the other hand in step S print processor unit causes print unit to make printing by giving print unit determination waiting print job file for which the printing is determined as not restricted in step S.

As described above according to Embodiment 1 a response from printer is directly sent to mobile terminal by using a communication scheme using a public telecommunication network. Thus mobile terminal does not have to respond to the software in the cloud or Internet environment through bidirectional communications or the software of mobile terminal does not have to analyze the status in the response from printer . For these reasons printer in an environment using a cloud technology or Internet technology is capable of notifying a user of an authentication result certainly. Here the public telecommunication network used herein may be of any widely used communication scheme such as e mail telephone or facsimile.

Storage unit stores information necessary for processing in mobile terminal . For example storage unit stores log on information screen data print data and address table . Storage unit in Embodiment 2 is different from storage unit in Embodiment 1 in that storage unit stores address table instead of storing mail address . Address table is address identification information indicating a mail address for each user ID.

Address table includes user ID column and mail address column . User ID column stores user IDs. Mail address column stores the mail addresses of users identified with the user IDs in user ID column . For example controller unit causes display unit to display mail address input screen IM illustrated in a user inputs the mail address via input unit and the inputted mail address is stored in mail address column . Note that a user ID contained in log on information used in the input event of the mail address is stored in user ID column

Controller unit includes printer driver unit and receiver unit . Controller unit in Embodiment 2 is different from controller unit in Embodiment 1 in terms of printer driver unit .

Printer driver unit generates a print job based on which printer is to make printing and sends the print job to printer . Printer driver unit includes print data generator unit user ID acquisition unit mail address acquisition unit data adder unit and print job output unit . Printer driver unit in Embodiment 2 is different from printer driver unit in Embodiment 1 in that printer driver unit does not include mail address input unit and performs different processing in mail address acquisition unit .

Mail address acquisition unit acquires the mail address of the user of mobile terminal . For example mail address acquisition unit acquires the mail address associated with the user ID acquired by user ID acquisition unit from address table stored in storage unit .

Storage unit stores information necessary for processing in printer . For example storage unit stores determination waiting print job file . Storage unit in Embodiment 2 is different from storage unit in Embodiment 1 in that storage unit does not store print function restriction table .

Controller unit controls processing in printer . Controller unit includes receiver unit print processor unit and authentication inquiry unit as an inquiry unit. Controller unit in Embodiment 2 is different from controller unit in Embodiment 1 in that controller unit includes authentication inquiry unit in place of authentication determination unit and authentication result transmitter unit and performs different processing in receiver unit and print processor unit .

Receiver unit performs not only the same processing as in receiver unit in Embodiment 1 but also processing of receiving an authentication result command as response information sent from authentication server . For example receiver unit receives the authentication result command received by communication unit . Then receiver unit gives the received authentication result command to print processor unit .

In order to inquire of authentication server about print function restriction for the user identified with the user ID authentication inquiry unit generates an authentication inquiry command as inquiry information and sends the generated authentication inquiry command to authentication server . For example authentication inquiry unit causes communication unit to transmit the generated authentication inquiry command. Here the authentication inquiry command contains user ID and mail address contained in print job received by receiver unit . Moreover the authentication inquiry command contains determination reference information which is necessary to determine whether or not to impose restriction on processing of a print job. The determination reference information used herein is color information indicating whether or not print data contained in print job received by receiver unit is data for color printing.

Returning to the description of print processor unit receives an authentication result command from receiver unit . If the authentication result command indicates that the restriction is not imposed on the processing of the print job print processor unit causes print unit to make the printing based on determination waiting print job file for which the determination is made. On the other hand if the authentication result command indicates that the restriction is imposed on the processing of the print job print processor unit deletes determination waiting print job file for which the determination is made from storage unit .

Storage unit stores information necessary for processing in authentication server . For example storage unit stores print function restriction table . Print function restriction table is print function restriction information indicating a condition under which printing is restricted for each user ID and is the same as or similar to that presented in .

Controller unit controls processing in authentication server . Controller unit includes receiver unit authentication determination unit as a determination unit authentication response unit as a response unit and authentication result transmitter unit as a result transmitter unit.

Receiver unit receives authentication inquiry command . For example receiver unit receives authentication inquiry command received by communication unit . Then receiver unit acquires user ID mail address and color information from received authentication inquiry command .

Authentication determination unit determines whether or not to impose restriction on the processing of print job . For example authentication determination unit determines whether or not print data contained in print job is printable. Specifically on the basis of user ID and color information acquired by receiver unit authentication determination unit refers to print function restriction table stored in storage unit and determines whether or not the print function to be used is restricted.

Authentication response unit sends printer response information indicating the result of determination made by authentication determination unit . For example authentication response unit generates authentication result command according to the result of the authentication made by authentication determination unit . Then authentication response unit causes communication unit to transmit generated authentication result command to printer .

Authentication result transmitter unit generates notification information concerning print job corresponding to authentication inquiry command received from printer and sends the generated notification information to the address contained in this authentication inquiry command . For example if authentication determination unit determines that the printing is unavailable authentication result transmitter unit sends from communication unit information on the determination result in the form of an e mail from communication unit to the destination address set to the mail address acquired by receiver unit . For example authentication result transmitter unit generates an e mail containing information indicating the resultant printing unavailable status and the explanation of the print restriction as presented in . Then authentication result transmitter unit causes communication unit to transmit the generated e mail.

Authentication server described above can be implemented for example by a computer including a CPU a RAM external storage devices such as a ROM and an HDD Hard Disk Drive and a communication device for Internet connection. For example storage unit can be implemented by the CPU using any of the RAM and the external storage devices controller unit can be implemented by the CPU loading a predetermined program stored in any of the external storage devices onto the RAM and executing the loaded program and communication unit can be implemented by the CPU using the communication device.

When input unit of mobile terminal receives an instruction from the user printer driver unit performs print processing. Firstly print data generator unit generates print data S . Print data generator unit stores the generated print data in storage unit . Next data adder unit reads print data from storage unit and generates a print job by adding the user ID and the mail address to read print data S . Print job output unit sends the generated print job to printer from communication unit via Internet S .

Receiver unit of printer receives the print job via communication unit acquires the user ID and the mail address contained in the received print job and stores the received print job as determination waiting print job file in storage unit . Thereafter authentication inquiry unit analyses the print data contained in the print job to acquire the color information generates authentication inquiry command by using the color information as well as the user ID and the mail address acquired by the receiver unit and sends authentication inquiry command to authentication server via communication unit S .

Receiver unit of authentication server receives authentication inquiry command via communication unit and acquires user ID mail address and color information from received authentication inquiry command . Then authentication determination unit determines print function restriction on the basis of user ID and color information acquired by receiver unit S . Here it is assumed that authentication determination unit determines that the printing is unavailable.

Authentication result transmitter unit generates an e mail indicating the result of the determination made by authentication determination unit for example the printing unavailability status and the explanation of the print function restriction and transmits the e mail to the mail address acquired by receiver unit from communication unit S .

Thereafter authentication response unit generates authentication result command based on the result of determination made by the authentication determination unit and transmits authentication result command to printer from communication unit S . Here it is assumed that authentication result command is set as printing unavailable.

Receiver unit of mobile terminal receives the e mail via communication unit and causes display unit to display the content of the e mail in response to an instruction from the user S . Thus the user of mobile terminal can check the determination result of the print function restriction for the print job.

In addition receiver unit of printer receives authentication result command via communication unit . Since authentication result command received herein is set as printing unavailable print processor unit cancels the printing and deletes determination waiting print job file determined as printing unavailable from storage unit S .

User ID acquisition unit acquires the user ID of the user who currently logs on from log on information stored in storage unit by using the API function of the OS S .

Mail address acquisition unit searches address table stored in storage unit by using as a key the user ID acquired by user ID acquisition unit and thereby acquires the mail address associated with the user ID S .

Print data generator unit generates print data through a certain known process S . Print data generator unit stores the generated print data in storage unit .

Data adder unit reads print data from storage unit and generates a print job by adding the user ID acquired in step S and the mail address acquired in step S to print data S .

Print job output unit outputs the print job generated in step S to printer from communication unit via Internet S .

Receiver unit determines whether or not communication unit receives a print job S . If a print job is received Yes in S the processing proceeds to a user ID acquisition process in step S.

Thereafter receiver unit stores the received print job as determination waiting print job file in storage unit S .

Next authentication inquiry unit identifies the color information by determining whether or not the print data contained in determination waiting print job file stored in step S is data for color printing. Then authentication inquiry unit generates authentication inquiry command containing the user ID acquired in step S the mail address acquired in step S and the identified color information and outputs authentication inquiry command from communication unit to authentication server S .

Receiver unit determines whether or not communication unit receives authentication inquiry command S . If authentication inquiry command is received YES in S the processing proceeds to a user ID acquisition process in step S.

Subsequently authentication determination unit performs a search process on print function restriction table S . Specifically authentication determination unit searches print function restriction table presented in by using the user ID acquired in step S as a key and thereby acquires the color printing availability information associated with the user ID.

Then authentication determination unit determines whether or not to restrict the printing S based on color information acquired in step S and the color printing availability information acquired in step S. Here authentication determination unit determines that the printing is restricted if color information acquired in step S indicates that the color printing is requested and the color printing availability information acquired in step S indicates that the color printing is not permitted. In other cases authentication determination unit determines that the printing is not restricted. The processing proceeds to step S if the printing is determined as restricted printing unavailable or proceeds to step S if the printing is determined as not restricted printing available .

In step S authentication response unit generates authentication result command set as printing unavailable.

In addition authentication result transmitter unit generates an e mail containing text indicating the printing unavailability status and the explanation of the restriction of the authentication result. Then authentication result transmitter unit outputs the generated e mail from communication unit to the destination address set to the mail address acquired in step S S . Here any known technique may be used as the output process of the e mail.

On the other hand in step S authentication response unit generates authentication result command set as printing available.

Then authentication response unit outputs authentication result command generated in step S or S to printer via communication unit S .

Receiver unit determines whether or not communication unit receives authentication result command S . If authentication result command is received Yes in S the processing proceeds to an authentication result acquisition process in step S.

In step S receiver unit acquires printing availability information contained in received authentication result command .

Print processor unit checks whether printing availability information acquired by receiver unit indicates that the printing is available or unavailable S . The processing proceeds to step S if it indicates that the printing is unavailable and proceeds to step S if it indicates that the printing is available.

In step S print processor unit deletes determination waiting print job file determined as printing unavailable in step S from storage unit .

On the other hand in step S print processor unit gives determination waiting print job file determined as printing available to print unit and thereby causes print unit to make the printing.

According to Embodiment 2 authentication server performs the authentication determination process and the authentication result transmission process. Thus the processing load on printer can be reduced.

Embodiments 1 and 2 are described for the case where printing is made via Internet . It should be noted however that Embodiments 1 and 2 are applicable to any communication method that does not support bidirectional communications.

In Embodiment 1 and 2 the status of printer is notified to the user via an e mail. However in addition to the status any other information held by printer may be notified to the user via an e mail. For example MENU information set in printer may be notified to the user via an e mail.

In Embodiment 1 described above by way of a non limiting example mobile terminal receives the input of the mail address as presented in step S in . In another example a step like step S may be omitted if the mail address is stored in address table in storage unit as in Embodiment 2.

In Embodiment 1 by way of a non limiting example mobile terminal is configured to receive an e mail from Internet . In another example information communication system is configured as illustrated in . This configuration allows mobile terminal to receive e mails from mobile telephone network as a public telecommunication network.

As illustrated in information communication system includes mobile terminal and printer . Mobile terminal and printer are connected to Internet and mobile terminal is also connected to mobile telephone network . In this case as illustrated in mobile terminal includes first communication unit A configured to establish connection to Internet and third communication unit B configured to establish connection to mobile telephone network . With this configuration an e mail outputted to Internet from printer is converted from a format for Internet to a format for mobile telephone network by exchange and then is sent to mobile terminal from mobile telephone network . Receiver unit acquires the e mail via third communication unit B. First communication unit A and third communication unit B transmit and receive information through wireless communications.

Similarly also in Embodiment 2 mobile terminal may include a first communication unit configured to establish connection to Internet and a third communication unit configured to establish connection to a mobile telephone network and receive an e mail from the mobile telephone network.

In addition as illustrated in information communication system may be configured such that both mobile terminal and printer are connected to both Internet and mobile telephone network . In this case printer transmits an e mail to mobile telephone network and mobile terminal receives the e mail from mobile telephone network .

In this case as illustrated in printer includes first communication unit A configured to establish connection to Internet and second communication unit B configured to establish connection to mobile telephone network .

Further also in Embodiment 2 authentication server may include a first communication unit configured to establish connection to Internet and a second communication unit configured to establish connection to the mobile telephone network and transmit an e mail to the mobile telephone network.

In Embodiment 2 by way of a non limiting example authentication inquiry command and authentication result command are transmitted and received via Internet . In another example printer and authentication server may be provided with dedicated interface units respectively and may be directly connected to each other. Instead printer and authentication server may be connected to a LAN or the like which is a network other than Internet and may transmit and receive these commands via this network.

Moreover as in information communication system illustrated in cloud server may be connected to Internet . In this case print job output unit of mobile terminal causes communication unit to transmit a print job to cloud server . Then cloud server forwards the received print job to printer . Then receiver unit of printer receives the print job received by communication unit .

Storage unit stores information necessary for processing in cloud server . For example storage unit stores a print job received by communication unit as transmission waiting print job .

Controller unit controls processing in cloud server . Controller unit includes receiver unit and transmitter unit .

Receiver unit receives a print job via communication unit and stores the received print job as transmission waiting print job in storage unit .

Transmitter unit sends transmission waiting print job stored in storage unit to printer via communication unit .

Here transmitter unit sends transmission waiting print job at predetermined timing. For example transmitter unit checks the status of communications with printer by using PING and or the like and sends transmission waiting print job when determining that the communications with printer are possible. Instead transmitter unit may send transmission waiting print jobs on a regular basis. Moreover when the data amount or the number of transmission waiting print jobs stored in storage unit reaches a predetermined threshold transmitter unit may send transmission waiting print jobs .

Cloud server described above can be implemented for example by a computer including a CPU a RAM external storage devices such as a ROM and an HDD and a communication device for Internet connection.

For example storage unit can be implemented by the CPU using any of the RAM and the external storage devices controller unit can be implemented by the CPU loading a predetermined program stored in any of the external storage devices onto the RAM and executing the loaded program and communication unit can be implemented by the CPU using the communication device.

Also in Embodiment 2 cloud server may be connected to Internet and the same processing as that described above can be executed.

In Embodiments 1 and 2 described above whether or not the printing is available is determined based on print function restriction table presented in .
