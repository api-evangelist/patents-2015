abstract: An optical fiber positioner having an elongated base with sidewalls and a longitudinally extending throughbore. A flexible optical fiber extends through the throughbore and has one end protruding outwardly from an end surface of the base. A plurality of actuators are secured to the sidewalls of the base so that an end of each actuator is positioned adjacent the end of the base. A crossbeam is then connected to the ends of each actuator so that the crossbeam moves laterally relative to the base in unison with the deflection of the actuators. The crossbeam has an opening through which the optical fiber extends so that the optical fiber deflects in unison with the lateral movement of the crossbeam. Various fixtures for assembly of the optical fiber positioner are also shown.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The present invention relates generally to optical fiber positioners as well as a method for making the same.

There are many previously known optical fiber positioners. Such optical fiber positioners are used for example in optical scanners as well as other applications.

One such application for an optical fiber positioner is for use in free space laser transmissions which use the fiber optic for delivering the laser radiation into free space from the distal end of the delivery fiber. One requirement of an optical fiber positioner for use with laser transmissions in free space however is that the position of the optic fiber be precisely controlled.

For example axial displacement of the optic fiber should be in the range of a fraction of a micron in order to obtain useful transmissions into free space. Furthermore frequency bandwidth for the fiber tip displacement should be in the range of hundreds or even thousands of hertz for keeping the spot on the target or receiver effectively mitigating the wandering of beams for lower bandwidths.

Fiber optic collimators with fast displacement of the emitting tips can be combined into densely packed arrays. The direction of each beam can be controlled independently thus providing adaptive capability without additional expensive elements such as deformable mirrors and the like. However the dense packing of such collimators into such arrays requires very high accuracy for the position of the optical fiber tips as well as high speed accuracy of movement of the fiber tips for reliable overlapping of all of the collimation beams onto the target.

Although there have been previously known optical fiber positioners for use with laser communications in free space none of them have been able to obtain reliable large bandwidth communications.

The present invention provides an optical fiber positioner which provides high accuracy and which overcomes the above mentioned disadvantages of the previously known devices.

In brief the optical fiber positioner of the present invention includes an elongated base having four sidewalls that are circumferentially equidistantly spaced from each other as well as a longitudinally extending throughbore. A flexible optical fiber extends through the throughbore and has one end protruding outwardly from an end of the base.

A piezoelectric actuator is secured to each of the base sidewalls. The actuators are generally planar in shape and two of the actuators are spaced apart and parallel from each other while similarly the other two actuators are also parallel and spaced apart from each other but orthogonal relative to the first two actuators. One actuator is secured to each of the base sidewalls so that an end of each actuator is positioned adjacent the end of the base.

A crossbeam is then connected to the ends of the actuator so that the crossbeam moves laterally relative to the base in unison with the deflection of the actuators. This crossbeam has an opening through which the optical fiber extends and so that the optical fiber deflects in unison with the lateral movement of the crossbeam.

The present invention also discloses the use of two highly accurate fixtures which when used during the construction of the optical fiber positioner are capable of constructing the optical fiber positioner with high accuracy which is repeatable. As such the optical fiber positioner when used in an array with other optical fiber positioners also constructed according to the present invention laser communication in free space with large bandwidths is achieved.

With reference first to an optical fiber positioner according to the present invention is shown. The optical fiber positioner includes an elongated base which is generally square in cross sectional shape see . A longitudinally extending throughbore is formed through the base . This throughbore is dimensioned to receive an optical fiber surrounded by a protective sheath . Furthermore one end of the optic fiber protrudes outwardly from an upper end of the base .

As best shown in a drop of adhesive is applied between a lower end of the protective sheath and the optic fiber and a reinforcing tube is positioned around the sheath and adhesive . Similarly a second drop of adhesive is applied between the other or upper end of the protective sheath and the optic fiber . These drops of adhesive and serve both to maintain the accuracy of the optical fiber relative to its protective sheath and also add stability to the overall construction of the optical fiber and its protective sheath . A reinforcing tube is also positioned around the end of the sheath and the adhesive .

Referring again to a generally planar actuator is associated with each of the four sides of the base . Consequently two of the actuators are spaced apart and parallel to each other on opposite sides of the base while similarly the other two actuators are also spaced apart and parallel to each other but lie in a plane orthogonal to the plane of the first two actuators . Furthermore one end of each actuator is positioned adjacent the upper end of the base .

The actuators are constructed from two or more layers of a piezoelectric material. Furthermore as best shown in the actuators are each secured to a mounting surface on the base by an adhesive. Thus when an electric voltage is applied to contact pads on the actuator the actuator will flex about its contact surface with the base by an amount and a direction corresponding to the polarity and magnitude of the applied voltage.

With reference now to a cross shaped crossbeam includes a center hub and four outwardly extending arms so that one arm extends outwardly toward each of the four actuators . A saddle is formed on the free end of each arm . This saddle is dimensioned to fit within a notch formed at the upper end of the actuator as shown in . Furthermore with the saddle nested in the notch protrusions on the saddle prevent movement of the saddle in a radial direction relative to the hub . Simultaneously the coaction between the saddle and the sidewalls of the notch prevents movement of the saddle relative to the actuator in a tangential direction relative to the hub . The saddles and their respective actuators are preferably glued together.

With reference still to the hub includes an opening which extends longitudinally relative to the base . This opening is dimensioned to receive the optical fiber and the sheath therethrough. Furthermore the opening in the hub is dimensioned to be substantially the same as the outside dimension of the protective sheath so that the hub and thus the optic fiber move in unison with any lateral movement of the crossbeam .

In operation an electric voltage is applied to the electrical connection pads on the actuators . The actuators will then deflect by an amount and in a direction equal to the magnitude of the voltage and polarity of the voltage relative to the base . In doing so the actuators laterally displace the crossbeam and thus laterally displace the tip of the optical fiber . The displacement of the tip of the optical fiber furthermore may occur at a high frequency.

In order to obtain the high accuracy of the position of the tip of the optical fiber for certain applications such as laser communication in free space it is necessary that the actuators be precisely positioned relative to the base and likewise that the crossbeam be accurately positioned relative to the actuators .

With reference then to a fixture is shown for accurately constructing the optical positioner with a high degree of precision. The fixture includes a fixture base with cylinder area and a holder secured to the base . This holder includes an upper threaded portion which threadably engages a threaded bore in the base so that the position of the base is precisely positioned relative to the fixture base . Four pillars are secured to the cylinder mount capable to rotate around cylinder area so that one pillar is aligned and associated with each of the four actuators .

In order to precisely position the actuators onto the base a machine locating surface is formed on at least a portion of the bottom of each actuator . These locator surfaces in turn abut against a precision locator surface formed on the base . Consequently with each of the four actuators positioned onto the base so that their locator surfaces are flatly abutting against their associated locating surfaces on the base the vertical position of each actuator relative to the base is precisely fixed.

With reference now to in order to ensure that the actuators are precisely positioned circumferentially around the base a spacing fixture is snugly positioned around the base so that the spacing fixture is spaced upwardly from the locator surface formed on the base . This locating fixture includes four generally rectangular pockets each of which is designed to receive one actuator . Furthermore these pockets each include a said mount surface and locator surfaces on their sides which are precisely spaced apart from each other. These locator surfaces furthermore flatly abut against like locator surfaces on the sides of the actuators in order to precisely circumferentially position the actuators around the base . Furthermore a square central bulk on top of base is dimensioned to precisely fit around the base so that the position of the bulk is fixed relative to the fixture .

With reference now to with the actuators flatly positioned against the locator surfaces and on the base and fixture respectively a screw threadably engages each pillar and is aligned with the mounting surface on the base . With glue applied to the mounting surface and the spacing fixture positioned around the base the screws are compressed against the actuators preferably through a piece of elastomeric material to thereby hold the actuators against their mounting surface on the base until the adhesive has set. Any excess adhesive is collected within chambers around the base .

With reference now to a cross imitator is shown having four simulated saddles i.e. one saddle for each of the channels in the actuators . These saddles furthermore are precisely machined to closely simulate the size of the saddles on the crossbeam . As such with the saddles of the cross imitators positioned within their receiving channels in the actuators the tops of the actuators are precisely positioned.

In addition the cross imitator flatly abuts against a flat locator surface on the top of base to vertically position the cross imitator . Four flanges only two shown in on the cross imitator also abut against four location surfaces only two shown in on the top of base to precisely position the cross imitator .

The cross imitator is left in position as shown in until the glue attaching the actuators to the base has set. Thereafter the cross imitator is removed and replaced by the crossbeam . The saddles for the crossbeam are each adhesively secured to their receiving channels in the actuators . Once the crossbeam has been attached to the actuators the construction of the fiber positioner is completed and the fiber positioner is removed from the holding fixture .

From the foregoing it can be seen that the present invention provides both an improved fiber optic positioner with a wide frequency bandwidth as well as a method of fabrication of the positioner. Having described my invention however many modifications thereto will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which it pertains without deviation from the spirit of the invention as defined by the scope of the appended claims.
