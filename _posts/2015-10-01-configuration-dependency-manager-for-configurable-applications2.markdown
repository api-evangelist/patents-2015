title: Configuration dependency manager for configurable applications
abstract: In one embodiment, during runtime use of a configurable application that is used by multiple service requesters, a configuration dependency manager is integrated in the configurable application to check a set of features for one of the service requesters. The method receives a service requester configuration for the set of features. A configuration dependency manager determines a set of dependencies for the set of features that have been configured by the service requester configuration and determines a developer's configuration for a plurality of features for the configurable application. Then, the configuration dependency manager analyzes the set of dependencies with corresponding dependencies in the developer's configuration to determine when an issue exists with the service requester configuration and provides a visualization of the set of features based on the analyzing the set of dependencies, wherein the issue is shown on the visualization.
