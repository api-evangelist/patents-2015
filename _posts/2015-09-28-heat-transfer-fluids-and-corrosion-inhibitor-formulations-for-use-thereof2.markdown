This is a continuation in part of prior application Ser. No. 14 087 796 filed Nov. 22 2013 U.S. Pat. No. 9 145 613 which in turn is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 13 606 452 filed Sep. 7 2012 U.S. Pat. No. 8 617 416 . The entire contents of both of these documents are incorporated herein by reference.

The present teachings relate generally to heat transfer fluids and in some embodiments to heat transfer fluids for inhibiting corrosion in heat transfer systems.

Modern vehicle engines may use a heat transfer fluid e.g. liquid coolant to provide long lasting year round protection of their cooling systems. A key function of heat transfer fluids is to transfer excess heat from an engine to a radiator for dissipation. Efficient heat transfer and control of engine temperature leads to efficient fuel economy and lubrication and may prevent engine failures due to freeze up boiling over or over heating. Ideally engine coolant may also serve to provide corrosion protection of cooling system metals e.g. over a range of different temperature and operating conditions .

Common corrosion related problems that may arise in automotive cooling systems include 1 cavitation corrosion and rusting of cylinder heads and cylinder blocks 2 seal leakage bellows seal failure and cavitation corrosion in water pumps 3 solder bloom scale and deposit formation and pitting in radiators and heater cores 4 thermostat sticking and or 5 crevice corrosion at hose necks. In addition erosion corrosion galvanic corrosion under deposit corrosion and or stray current corrosion may occur at susceptible locations in a cooling system depending on conditions.

Different kinds of metals may be used to fabricate the various parts of a cooling system. By way of example cast iron and cast aluminum alloys may be used for cylinder blocks cylinder heads intake manifolds coolant pumps and power electronic device enclosures wrought aluminum and copper alloys may be used for radiators and heater cores solders may be used to join the components of brass or copper radiators or heater cores steel may be used for cylinder head gaskets and for small components such as freeze plugs coolant pump housing enclosures and coolant pump impellers and copper alloys may be used in thermostats.

Corrosion protection of components manufactured from aluminum or aluminum alloys e.g. engine block cylinder head water pump heat exchangers and the like corrosion protection of heat transfer system components produced by a controlled atmosphere brazing CAB process e.g. heat exchangers and corrosion protection at high temperature e.g. in cooling systems for vehicles equipped with exhaust gas recirculation or EGR are of particular interest.

In some embodiments the pH of a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings at 50 concentration is between about 7.2 and about 9.0. In some embodiments a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings is free from silicate borate and amines and has a nitrate concentration of less than about 50 ppm as NO.

In some embodiments a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings is a single phase homogeneous solution at room temperature. In some embodiments a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings is storage stable at a temperature between about 10 C. and 100 C. In some embodiments a heat transfer fluid concentrate and or a ready to use heat transfer fluid derived therefrom e.g. by dilution will meet the properties and performance requirements of ASTM D3306.

In some embodiments a heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings may be diluted e.g. with water to form a heat transfer fluid. For example in some embodiments the heat transfer fluid concentrate may be diluted by about 10 vol. to about 75 vol. to form a heat transfer fluid. In some embodiments the water used for dilution is deionized water as described in Section 4.5 of ASTM D3306 10.

In some embodiments heat transfer fluid concentrate in accordance with the present teachings may be provided as a commercially available product. In other embodiments a ready to use heat transfer fluid in which the heat transfer fluid concentrate has been pre diluted to around 50 vol. with water may be provided as a commercially available product. In preparing a ready to use heat transfer fluid by dilution the optimal level of water added to the heat transfer concentrate at use conditions may be determined by the desired freeze up boil over and corrosion protection requirements.

Heat transfer fluid concentrate that has not been diluted by adding water is typically not used in an engine cooling system as a heat transfer fluid due to its relatively low heat transfer coefficient or specific heat high viscosity and high freeze point. Thus heat transfer fluid concentrates may be diluted e.g. to 40 vol. to 60 vol. solutions by adding water before being used in engine cooling systems as heat transfer fluids. Vehicle manufacturers typically use 50 vol. heat transfer concentrate diluted by water as factory fill fluid in vehicle cooling systems. Heat transfer fluid products that are pre diluted by water to contain about 40 vol. to about 60 vol. heat transfer fluid concentrate are ready to use coolants because no additional water is needed when they are added into a vehicle cooling system.

In a ready to use heat transfer fluid the freezing point depressant may be present in an amount of about 1 wt. to less than about 90 wt. based on the total weight of the ready to use heat transfer fluid. Within this range the amount of the freezing point depressant may be greater than or equal to about 30 wt. greater than or equal to about 40 wt. greater than or equal to about 50 wt. greater than or equal to about 55 wt. greater than or equal to about 60 wt. greater than or equal to about 70 wt. greater than or equal to about 75 wt. greater than or equal to about 80 wt. greater than or equal to about 85 wt. greater than or equal to about 86 wt. greater than or equal to about 87 wt. greater than or equal to about 88 wt. or greater than or equal to about 89 wt. but less than about 90 wt. based on the total weight of the ready to use heat transfer fluid. Also within this range the amount of the freezing point depressant may be less than or equal to about 30 wt. less than or equal to about 40 wt. less than or equal to about 50 wt. less than or equal to about 55 wt. less than or equal to about 60 wt. less than or equal to about 70 wt. less than or equal to about 75 wt. less than or equal to about 80 wt. less than or equal to about 85 wt. less than or equal to about 86 wt. less than or equal to about 87 wt. less than or equal to about 88 wt. or less than or equal to about 89 wt. but more than about 1 wt. based on the total weight of the ready to use heat transfer fluid.

In the ready to use heat transfer fluid the carboxylate may be present in an amount of about 0.5 wt. to about 8 wt. based on the total weight of the ready to use heat transfer fluid.
