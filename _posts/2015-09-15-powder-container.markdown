This application is a continuation of PCT international application Ser. No. PCT JP2014 057949 filed on Mar. 14 2014 which designates the United States the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference and which claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Applications No. 2013 054371 filed on Mar. 15 2013 No. 2013 054372 filed on Mar. 15 2013 No. 2013 110330 filed on May 24 2013 No. 2013 110443 filed on May 24 2013 No. 2013 146882 filed on Jul. 12 2013 No. 2013 153815 filed on Jul. 24 2013 No. 2013 244411 filed on Nov. 26 2013 and No. 2014 019469 filed on Feb. 4 2014 incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to a powder container for storing toner that is powder used by an image forming apparatus such as a printer a facsimile machine a copier or a multifunction peripheral with multiple functions of the printer the facsimile machine and the copier and also relates to an image forming apparatus including the powder container.

In electrophotographic image forming apparatuses a powder replenishing device supplies replenishes toner that is powder from a toner container serving as a powder container containing the toner to a developing device. A toner container described in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 2012 133349 includes an opening arranged on one end of the toner container a nozzle receiver provided at the opening to receive a conveying nozzle that includes a powder receiving hole for receiving toner from the toner container a rotary conveyor that rotates to convey the toner toward the powder receiving hole and a gear that meshes with a container driving gear of a main body of the image forming apparatus to transmit a driving force to the rotary conveyor. When the toner container is attached to the powder replenishing device the gear meshes with the container driving gear on the opening side relative to the powder receiving hole in the longitudinal direction of the toner container. In this configuration the influence of the arrangement of the gear can be reduced when the toner is transferred to the powder receiving hole of the conveying nozzle and the toner can be transferred more smoothly than in a conventional configuration.

However if the gear of the container is driven a pressure generated at a position where the gear and the container driving gear of the main body mesh with each other is applied to the toner container or the conveying nozzle. Therefore if an attached position of the toner container with respect to the powder replenishing device is not determined a load on the conveying nozzle or the nozzle receiver increases so that the conveying nozzle or the nozzle receiver may be broken or a gap may be generated between the conveying nozzle and the nozzle receiver resulting in toner leakage.

The present invention has been made in view of the abovementioned issues and it is an object of the present invention to provide a powder container and an image forming apparatus that are capable of improving the performance to transfer powder from the powder container to the toner replenishing device and capable of reducing a load due to the drive transmitted by the container driving gear.

According to an embodiment a powder container contains powder used for forming an image and to be attached to an image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus includes a conveying nozzle to convey the powder a powder receiving hole of the conveying nozzle to receive the powder from the powder container an apparatus main body gear to transmit a driving force to the powder container and a container receiving section that includes the conveying nozzle and receives the powder container. The powder container includes an opening that is at one end of the powder container in a longitudinal direction a nozzle receiver at the opening to receive the conveying nozzle a conveyor to convey the powder and a container gear to drive the conveyor by meshing with the apparatus main body gear. The container gear is to mesh with the apparatus main body gear at a position closer to the opening than the powder receiving hole in the longitudinal direction and the opening is to mate with the container receiving section.

Various embodiments of the present invention will be explained below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the embodiments the same components or components with the same functions are denoted by the same reference numerals and symbols and the same explanation will not be repeated. The descriptions below are mere examples and do not limit the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore a person skilled in the art may easily conceive other embodiments by making modifications or changes within the scope of the appended claims however such modifications and changes obviously fall within the scope of the appended claims. In the drawings Y M C and K are symbols appended to components corresponding to yellow magenta cyan and black respectively and will be omitted appropriately.

Four toner containers Y M C K serving as powder containers corresponding to different colors yellow magenta cyan black are detachably replaceably attached to a toner container holder serving as a container holding section provided in the upper part of the printer . An intermediate transfer device is arranged below the toner container holder .

The intermediate transfer device includes an intermediate transfer belt serving as an intermediate transfer medium four primary transfer bias rollers Y M C K a secondary transfer backup roller multiple tension rollers an intermediate transfer cleaning device and the like. The intermediate transfer belt is stretched and supported by multiple roller members and endlessly moves in the arrow direction in along with rotation of the secondary transfer backup roller that serves as one of the roller members.

In the printer four image forming sections Y M C K corresponding to the respective colors are arranged in tandem so as to face the intermediate transfer belt . Four toner replenishing devices Y M C K serving as powder supply replenishing devices corresponding to the four toner containers Y M C K of the four colors are arranged below the toner containers respectively. The toner replenishing devices Y M C K respectively supply replenish toner that is powder developer contained in the toner containers Y M C K to developing devices of the image forming sections Y M C K for the respective colors. In the embodiment the four image forming sections Y M C K form an image forming unit.

As illustrated in the printer includes an exposing device serving as a latent image forming means below the four image forming sections . The exposing device exposes and scans the surfaces of photoconductors Y M C K serving as image bearers to be described later with light based on image information of an original image read by the scanner so that electrostatic latent images are formed on the surfaces of the photoconductors. The image information may be input from an external apparatus such as a personal computer connected to the copier instead of being read by the scanner .

In the embodiment a laser beam scanning system using a laser diode is employed as the exposing device . However other configurations such as a configuration including an LED array may be employed as the exposing means.

The image forming section Y includes the drum shaped photoconductor Y. The image forming section Y includes a charging roller Y serving as a charging device a developing device Y serving as a developing means a photoconductor cleaning device Y serving as a cleaning device and a neutralizing device all of which are arranged around the photoconductor Y. Image forming processes a charging process an exposing process a developing process a transfer process and a cleaning process are performed on the photoconductor Y so that a yellow toner image is formed on the photoconductor Y.

The other three image forming sections M C K have almost the same configurations as the image forming section Y for yellow except that colors of toner to be used are different and toner images corresponding to the respective toner colors are formed on the photoconductors M C K . Hereinafter explanation of only the image forming section Y for yellow will be given and explanation of the other three image forming sections M C K will be omitted appropriately.

The photoconductor Y is rotated clockwise in by a drive motor. The surface of the photoconductor Y is uniformly charged at a position facing the charging roller Y charging process . Subsequently the surface of the photoconductor Y reaches a position of irradiation with laser light L emitted by the exposing device where an electrostatic latent image for yellow is formed through exposure scanning exposing process . The surface of the photoconductor Y then reaches a position facing the developing device Y where the electrostatic latent image is developed with yellow toner to form a yellow toner image developing device .

The four primary transfer bias rollers Y M C K of the intermediate transfer device and the photoconductors Y M C K sandwich the intermediate transfer belt so that primary transfer nips are formed. A transfer bias with polarity opposite to the polarity of toner is applied to the primary transfer bias rollers Y M C K .

The surface of the photoconductor Y on which the toner image is formed through the developing process reaches the primary transfer nip facing the primary transfer bias roller Y across the intermediate transfer belt and the toner image on the photoconductor Y is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt at the primary transfer nip primary transfer process . At this time a slight amount of non transferred toner remains on the photoconductor Y. The surface of the photoconductor Y from which the toner image has been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt at the primary transfer nip reaches a position facing the photoconductor cleaning device Y. At this position the non transferred toner remaining on the photoconductor Y is mechanically collected by a cleaning blade included in the photoconductor cleaning device Y cleaning process . The surface of the photoconductor Y finally reaches a position facing the neutralizing device where the residual potential on the photoconductor Y is removed. In this way a series of image forming processes performed on the photoconductor Y is completed.

The above image forming processes are also performed on the other image forming sections M C K in the same manner as the image forming section Y for yellow. Specifically the exposing device arranged below the image forming sections M C K emits laser light L based on image information toward the photoconductors M C K of the image forming sections M C K . More specifically the exposing device emits the laser light L from a light source and irradiates each of the photoconductors M C K with the laser light L via multiple optical elements while performing scanning with the laser light L by a rotating polygon mirror. Subsequently toner images of the respective colors formed on the photoconductors M C K through the developing process are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt .

At this time the intermediate transfer belt moves in the arrow direction in and sequentially passes through the primary transfer nips of the primary transfer bias rollers Y M C K . Therefore the toner images of the respective colors on the photoconductors Y M C K are superimposed on the intermediate transfer belt as primary transfer so that a color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt .

The intermediate transfer belt on which the color toner image is formed by superimposing the toner images of the respective colors reaches a position facing a secondary transfer roller . At this position the secondary transfer backup roller and the secondary transfer roller sandwich the intermediate transfer belt so that a secondary transfer nip is formed. The color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt is transferred to a recording medium P such as a sheet of paper conveyed to the position of the secondary transfer nip due to for example the action of a transfer bias applied to the secondary transfer backup roller . At this time non transferred toner which has not been transferred to the recording medium P remains on the intermediate transfer belt . The intermediate transfer belt that has passed through the secondary transfer nip reaches the position of the intermediate transfer cleaning device where the non transferred toner remaining on the surface is collected. In this way a series of transfer processes performed on the intermediate transfer belt is completed.

The recording medium P is conveyed to the secondary transfer nip from a feed tray provided in the sheet feeder arranged below the printer via a feed roller a registration roller pair and the like. Specifically multiple recording media P are stacked in the feed tray . When the feed roller is rotated counterclockwise in the topmost recording medium P is fed to a nip between two rollers of the registration roller pair .

The recording medium P conveyed to the registration roller pair temporarily stops at the position of the nip between the rollers of the registration roller pair the rotation of which is being stopped. The registration roller pair is rotated to convey the recording medium P toward the secondary transfer nip in accordance with the timing at which the color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt reaches the secondary transfer nip. Accordingly a desired color image is formed on the recording medium P.

The recording medium P on which the color toner image is transferred at the secondary transfer nip is conveyed to the position of a fixing device . In the fixing device the color toner image transferred on the surface of the recording medium P is fixed to the recording medium P by heat and pressure applied by a fixing belt and a pressing roller. The recording medium P that has passed through the fixing device is discharged to the outside of the apparatus via a nip between rollers of a discharge roller pair . The recording medium P discharged to the outside of the apparatus by the discharge roller pair is sequentially stacked as an output image on a stack section . In this way a series of image forming processes in the copier is completed.

A configuration and operation of the developing device in the image forming section will be explained in detail below. In the following the image forming section Y for yellow will be explained by way of example. However the image forming section M C K for the other colors have the same configurations and perform the same operation.

As illustrated in the developing device Y includes a developing roller Y serving as a developer bearer a doctor blade Y serving as a developer regulating plate two developer conveying screws Y a toner density sensor Y and the like. The developing roller Y faces the photoconductor Y. The doctor blade Y faces the developing roller Y. The two developer conveying screws Y are arranged inside two developer accommodating sections i.e. first and second developer accommodating sections Y and Y. The developing roller Y includes a magnet roller fixed inside thereof and a sleeve that rotates around the magnet roller. Two component developer G containing carrier and toner is stored in the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y. The second developer accommodating section Y communicates with a toner dropping passage Y via an opening provided in the upper side thereof. The toner density sensor Y detects toner density in the developer G stored in the second developer accommodating section Y.

The developer G in the developing device circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being stirred by the two developer conveying screws Y. The developer G in the first developer accommodating section Y is supplied to and borne on the surface of the sleeve of the developing roller Y due to a magnetic field generated by the magnet roller in the developing roller Y while the developer G is being conveyed by one of the developer conveying screws Y. The sleeve of the developing roller Y rotates counterclockwise as indicated by an arrow in and the developer G borne on the developing roller Y moves on the developing roller Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this time the toner in the developer G electrostatically adheres to the carrier by being charged to the potential opposite to the polarity of the carrier due to triboelectric charging with the carrier in the developer G and is borne on the developing roller Y together with the carrier that is attracted by the magnetic field generated on the developing roller Y.

The developer G borne on the developing roller Y is conveyed in the arrow direction in and reaches a doctor section where the doctor blade Y and the developing roller Y face each other. The amount of the developer G on the developing roller Y is regulated and adjusted to an appropriate amount when the developer G passes through the doctor section and then conveyed to a development area facing the photoconductor Y. In the development area the toner in the developer G adheres to the latent image formed on the photoconductor Y by a developing electric field generated between the developing roller Y and the photoconductor Y. The developer G remaining on the surface of the developing roller Y that has passed through the development area reaches the upper side of the first developer accommodating section Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this position the developer G is separated from the developing roller Y.

The developer G in the developing device Y is adjusted so that the toner density falls within a predetermined range. Specifically toner contained in the toner container Y is replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y by the toner replenishing device Y to be described later in accordance with the amount of toner consumed from the developer G in the developing device Y through the development. The toner replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being mixed and stirred with the developer G by the two developer conveying screws Y.

Toner contained in the toner containers Y M C K attached to the toner container holder of the printer is appropriately replenished to the developing devices Y M C K in accordance with the consumption of toner in the developing devices Y M C K for the respective colors as illustrated in . At this time the toner in the toner containers Y M C K is replenished by the toner replenishing devices Y M C K provided for the respective colors.

As illustrated in among the four toner containers Y M C K the size of the toner container K containing black toner is different from the sizes of the toner containers Y M C containing yellow toner magenta toner and cyan toner. Specifically the diameter of the toner container K is greater than those of the other toner containers. Therefore it becomes possible to reduce the frequency of replacement of the toner container K containing black toner that is frequently used.

As for the toner replenishing devices Y M C K the shape of the toner replenishing device K to which the toner container K containing black toner is attached is different from the shapes of the toner replenishing devices Y M C to which the toner containers Y M C containing yellow toner magenta toner and cyan toner are attached in accordance with the shapes of the toner containers .

Incidentally the toner replenishing devices and the toner containers have almost the same configurations except that the colors of toner to be used in the image forming processes and the diameters of the toner containers are different. Therefore only the toner replenishing device Y and the toner container Y for yellow will be explained below and explanation of the toner replenishing devices M C K and the toner containers M C K for the other three colors will be omitted appropriately. In the following components configured in different manners for different colors may be denoted by symbols Y M C and K indicating the respective colors and components configured in the same manner for all of the colors and components common to all of the colors may be denoted by a symbol Y M C K or may be denoted without symbols.

The toner replenishing device Y M C K includes as illustrated in the toner container holder a conveying nozzle Y M C K serving as a conveying pipe a conveying screw Y M C K serving as an apparatus main body conveyor the toner dropping passage Y M C K and a container rotating part Y M C K serving as a driving part.

When a user performs attachment operation to push the toner container Y in the attachment direction indicated by an arrow Q in and and the toner container Y is moved inside the toner container holder of the printer the conveying nozzle Y of the toner replenishing device Y is inserted from a front side of the toner container Y in the attachment direction along with the attachment operation. Therefore the toner container Y and the conveying nozzle Y communicate with each other. A configuration for the communication along with the attachment operation will be described in detail later.

As an example of the toner container the toner container Y is a toner bottle in the form of an approximate cylinder. The toner container Y mainly includes a container front end cover Y serving as a container cover or a held portion that is non rotatably held by the toner container holder and includes a container body Y serving as a powder storage integrated with a container gear Y serving as a gear of the container. The container body Y and the container gear Y may be integrally provided as a single part or as a couple of separate parts. The container body Y is rotatably held by the container front end cover Y. In other words the container cover is a member that can rotate relative to the container gear.

As illustrated in the toner container holder mainly includes a container cover receiving section a container receiving section and an insertion hole part . The container cover receiving section is a section for holding the container front end cover Y and the container body of the toner container Y. The container receiving section is a section for supporting the container body Y of the toner container Y. An insertion hole serving as an insertion opening used in the attachment operation of the toner container Y is defined by the insertion hole part . When a main body cover arranged on the front side of the copier the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of is opened the insertion hole part of the toner container holder is exposed. Then attachment detachment operation of each of the toner containers Y M C K attachment detachment operation with the longitudinal direction of the toner containers taken as an attachment detachment direction is performed from the front side of the copier while each of the toner containers Y M C K is oriented with its longitudinal direction being parallel to the horizontal direction. Incidentally a setting cover Y in is a part of the container cover receiving section of the toner container holder .

The container receiving section is provided such that its longitudinal length becomes approximately the same as the longitudinal length of the container body Y. The container cover receiving section is arranged on a container front side of the container receiving section in the longitudinal direction attachment direction and the insertion hole part is arranged on a container rear side of the container receiving section in the longitudinal direction attachment direction . The four toner containers are able to move on the container receiving section in a sliding manner. Therefore along with the attachment operation of the toner container Y the container front end cover Y first passes through the insertion hole part slides on the container receiving section for a while and is finally attached to the container cover receiving section .

While the container front end cover Y is attached to the container cover receiving section the container rotating part driving part Y including a driving motor a driving gear or the like as illustrated in and inputs rotation drive to the container gear Y that is a gear provided in the container body Y via a container driving gear Y serving as an apparatus main body gear. Therefore the container body Y is rotated in the arrow A direction in . With the rotation of the container body Y a spiral groove Y serving as a rotary conveyor provided with a spiral shape on the inner surface of the container body Y conveys toner stored in the container body Y from one end on the left side in to the other end on the right side in along the longitudinal direction of the container body. Specifically in the embodiment the spiral groove Y serves as a rotary conveyor. Consequently the toner is supplied from the container front end cover Y side to the inside of the conveying nozzle Y via a nozzle hole serving as a powder receiving hole provided on the conveying nozzle Y. As illustrated in the powder container has a container opening opening portion on one end in the longitudinal direction thereof. And the nozzle hole communicates with an opening of shutter supporting portion serving as a shutter side opening at an inner position relative to the position where the container gear Y is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the container body in a state in which the toner container is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Specifically a position at which the container gear Y meshes with the container driving gear Y is closer to the container opening than the position where the nozzle hole and the opening of shutter supporting portion communicate with each other in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . And the container gear Y is positioned on one end side an opening side relative to the nozzle hole . More specifically the container gear meshes with the container driving gear at the position where a distance between the opening and the container gear is shorter than a distance between the opening of shutter supporting portion and the nozzle hole . That is in a state in which toner container is attached to the image forming apparatus the container gear Y is positioned between the container opening a front end of container opening and the nozzle hole in the longitudinal direction of the toner container .

The conveying screw Y is arranged in the conveying nozzle Y. When the container rotating part driving part Y inputs the rotation drive to a conveyor screw gear Y the conveying screw Y rotates to convey the toner supplied in the conveying nozzle Y. A downstream end of the conveying nozzle Y in the conveying direction is connected to the toner dropping passage Y. The toner conveyed by the conveying screw Y falls along the toner dropping passage Y by gravity and is replenished to the developing device Y the second developer accommodating section Y .

The toner containers Y M C K are replaced with new ones at the end of their lifetimes when the containers become empty because almost all of the contained toner is consumed . A gripper is arranged on one end of the toner container opposite the container front end cover in the longitudinal direction. When the toner container is to be replaced an operator can grip the gripper to pull out and detach the attached toner container .

The configuration of the container rotating part Y will be further explained below. The container rotating part Y includes the container driving gear Y and the conveyor screw gear Y. As illustrated in and when a driving motor serving as an apparatus main body gear fixed to a mounting frame is driven and an output gear is rotated the container driving gear Y rotates. The conveyor screw gear Y rotates by receiving the rotation of the output gear via a coupled gear .

The toner replenishing device Y controls the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y in accordance with the rotation frequency of the conveying screw Y. Therefore toner that passes through the conveying nozzle Y is directly conveyed to the developing device Y via the toner dropping passage Y without the need to control the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y. Even in the toner replenishing device Y configured to insert the conveying nozzle Y into the toner container Y as described in the embodiment it may be possible to provide a temporary toner storage such as a toner hopper.

The toner containers Y M C K and the toner replenishing devices Y M C K according to the embodiment will be explained in detail below. As described above the toner containers Y M C K and the toner replenishing devices Y M C K have almost the same configurations except that the colors of toner to be used are different. Therefore in the following explanation symbols Y M C and K representing the colors of toner will be omitted.

The toner replenishing device includes the conveying nozzle inside which the conveying screw is arranged and also includes a nozzle shutter serving as a nozzle opening closing member. The nozzle shutter is slidably mounted on the outer surface of the conveying nozzle so as to close the nozzle hole at the time of detachment which is before the toner container is attached in the states in and and to open the nozzle hole at the time of attachment which is when the toner container is attached in the states in and . The nozzle shutter includes a nozzle shutter flange serving as a flange on the downstream side in the attachment direction relative to an end surface of a nozzle receiver serving as a conveyor receiver to be described later that comes in contact with the conveying nozzle .

Meanwhile a receiving opening which serves as a nozzle insertion opening into which the conveying nozzle is inserted at the time of attachment is provided in the center of the front end of the toner container and a container shutter which serves as an opening closing member that closes the receiving opening at the time of detachment is provided.

The toner container holder includes the container receiving section that enables the toner container to slide and move when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device . As illustrated in and the container receiving section is divided into four sections in a width direction W perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container attachment detachment direction and gutters are provided that serve as container mounting sections extending from the insertion hole part to the container cover receiving section along the longitudinal direction of the container body . The toner containers Y M C K for the respective colors are able to move on the gutters in a sliding manner in the longitudinal direction. As illustrated in on a ceiling surface that is an opposite surface of a mounting surface of the gutter two projections and are provided so as to project from the ceiling surface toward the gutter and so as to extend along the longitudinal direction of the gutter and come in contact with an upward guide provided in the upper portion of the toner container when the toner container Y M C K slides and moves on the gutter .

On side surfaces and of the gutter which are opposite surfaces arranged in the width direction W guide rails and are arranged so as to face each other. The guide rails protrude in the width direction W from the respective side surfaces and extend in the longitudinal direction and are arranged in front of the container cover receiving section . The guide rails and have functions to guide the container opening serving as the opening to a container setting section serving as a container receiving section by being fitted to sliding guides which serve as guiding portions vertical restrictors vertical regulators vertical positioners or vertical guides when the toner container is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus.

Incidentally as illustrated in each of the guide rails may be extended to the vicinity of the insertion hole part in the longitudinal direction. Each of the guide rails is provided so as to be parallel to the rotation axis of the container body when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device . As illustrated in and the guide rails are provided such that the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction on the gutter K to which the toner container K is attached differ from the lengths of the guide rails Y M C in the height direction on the respective gutters Y M C to which the toner containers Y M C are attached. In particular the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction are longer than the lengths of the guide rails Y M C in the height direction. Meanwhile the diameters of the toner containers Y M C are smaller than the diameter of the toner container K therefore even when any of the toner containers Y M C is inserted in the gutter K a load due to the insertion operation is small and the toner container may be attached to a wrong position. However because the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction are longer than the lengths of the guide rails Y M C in the height direction if any of the toner containers Y M C is mounted on the gutter K the sliding guides to be described later of the toner container Y M C come in contact with the guide rails K during the attachment operation and therefore the movement in the attachment direction is restricted. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the toner containers Y M C from being erroneously attached. Incidentally only one of the guide rails arranged on one of the side surfaces is illustrated in and .

As illustrated in setting covers Y M C K for the respective colors are arranged on the container cover receiving section . The setting covers are provided such that the radial size of the setting cover K for black as illustrated in and differs from the radial sizes of the setting covers Y M C for yellow magenta and cyan as illustrated in and . More specifically the radial size of the setting cover K is greater than the radial sizes of the setting covers Y M C . The conveying nozzle is arranged in the center of the setting cover . As illustrated in the conveying nozzle is arranged so as to protrude from an end surface of container setting section that is on the inner side in the attachment direction and that serves as a second back surface of the container setting section located on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container toward the upstream side in the attachment direction inside the container cover receiving section . The container setting section serving as the container receiving section is arranged in the protruding direction of the conveying nozzle that is toward the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container so as to surround the conveying nozzle . Specifically the container setting section is arranged at the base of the conveying nozzle and serves as a positioner to determine the position of the container opening relative to the toner container holder where the container opening functions as a rotational shaft when the conveyor inside the toner container rotates to convey the toner contained in the toner container . Namely when the container opening is inserted in and mated to the container setting section the radial position of the container opening is determined.

As illustrated in and on a part of an inner surface of setting cover first cover inner periphery in other words on a part of an inner surface of the container cover receiving section a groove which has a depth extending in the attachment direction of the toner container from an edge of setting cover located on the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container is provided as a cut in the radial direction of the setting cover . At the base of the conveying nozzle located on the downstream side in the attachment direction relative to the groove of the setting cover when viewed from the attachment direction the container setting section is provided to which the container opening to be described later is mated when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device .

The container setting section is located at the base of the conveying nozzle includes an inner surface of container setting section in which the container opening is inserted and includes the end surface of container setting section on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container relative to the inner surface of container setting section . On the end surface of container setting section as illustrated in spring fixing parts protruding from the end surface of container setting section to the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container are provided at eight evenly spaced positions along the outer periphery of a nozzle shutter spring serving as a biasing member. In and the nozzle shutter spring is omitted to illustrate the shape of the spring fixing parts . By placing the spring fixing parts so as to cover the outer periphery of the nozzle shutter spring it becomes possible to restrict the radial movement of the nozzle shutter spring . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being set while the nozzle shutter spring is deviated in the radial direction and prevent the nozzle shutter spring from being caught between the end surface of container setting section and a front end of the container opening enabling to prevent a failure to attach the toner container to the toner replenishing device .

When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device an outer surface of container opening which is a part of the container opening is slidably mated to the container setting section . On the inner surface of container setting section as illustrated in contact surfaces which are parts of the inner surface of container setting section and which protrude inward in the radial direction from the inner surface of container setting section are provided at four evenly spaced positions. The contact surfaces and the outer surface of container opening slide against each other with rotation of the toner container . In the present embodiment the contact surfaces have the widths of about 4 millimeters mm in the circumferential direction and are provided at four evenly spaced positions. However for example the contact surfaces may have the widths of about 6 mm in the circumferential direction at three evenly spaced positions. If the areas of the contact surfaces that come in contact with the outer surface of container opening are too large the sliding resistance against the outer surface of container opening increases and a rotational load may be generated. In contrast if the areas are too small the contact surfaces are rubbed and worn over time due to the sliding against the outer surface of container opening and it becomes difficult to perform positioning with accuracy. Therefore it is preferable to determine the widths and the number of the contact surfaces to ensure the contact areas so that the defects as described above can be prevented.

By the mating the inner surface of container setting section to the outer surface of container opening of the toner container the position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device in the radial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container the attachment detachment direction is determined. In other words the container opening serves as a radial restrictor or radial positioner of the toner container with respect to the toner replenishment device . Furthermore when the toner container rotates the outer surface of container opening functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of container setting section functions as a bearing. In other words the container opening including the outer surface of container opening serves as a rotational shaft of the toner container .

Incidentally as a method to determine the position of the toner container relative to the container setting section the following method may be employed instead of the method to cause the outer surface of container opening to be mated to the inner surface of container setting section . For example as illustrated in FIG. C it may be possible to provide a plurality of protrusions for positioning on the front end of the toner container in the longitudinal direction and cause outer surfaces of the protrusions for positioning to be mated to the inner surface of container setting section to perform positioning. To determine the top bottom left and right positions of the toner container it is preferable to provide at least three protrusions for positioning. In the three protrusions for positioning are provided on the container front end so as to extend parallel to the longitudinal direction. Furthermore the three protrusions for positioning are provided at positions separated by 120 degrees about the center of the nozzle receiver of the toner container the center of the receiving opening in which the conveying nozzle is inserted . Namely the shape of the container opening is not limited to the continuous cylindrical shape but may be divided or may be a rod shape as long as the container opening functions as a positioner or a rotational shaft of the toner container .

In indicates the position at which the outer surface of container opening comes in sliding contact with the contact surfaces as parts of the inner surface of container setting section and at which the radial position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device is determined at this time.

Incidentally in the descriptions below it is repeatedly explained that the container opening of the toner container and the container setting section mate with each other in a slidable manner. The mating state is in a precise sense a state in which the outer surface of container opening of the toner container is in contact with the contact surfaces which is a part of the inner surface of container setting section . Hereinafter for simplicity of explanation the mating will be referred to as mating the outer surface of container opening with the inner surface of container setting section by omitting the contact surfaces

The container setting section includes as illustrated in the inner surface of container setting section to be mated to the outer surface of container opening of the toner container when the toner container is set. The inner diameter of the inner surface of container setting section is denoted by D. Furthermore the diameter of the outer surface of container opening of the toner container is denoted by d. To enable the outer surface of container opening of the toner container and the inner surface of container setting section to be rotatably mated to each other the diameter d of the outer surface of container opening of the toner container and the inner diameter D of the inner surface of container setting section are set such that d

As illustrated in and holes are provided so as to face each other in the width direction W of the setting cover . On the setting cover engaging members and serving as replenishing device engaging members to be described later are arranged so as to be able to move back and forth from the outer surface of the setting cover to the inner surface of setting cover side via the holes and . The engaging members and are biased from the outer side to the inner side of the setting cover by biasing means such as torsion coil springs .

Detailed explanations will be given below with reference to . Each of the engaging members is rotatably supported by the setting cover such that one end thereof is inserted in a shaft serving as a fulcrum protruding from a mounting part provided on the setting cover . On another end opposite the one end of each of the engaging members a spring press part and a rotation stopper are provided. Each of the torsion coil springs which serve as a pressing unit and are wound around respective pins provided near the mounting parts of the setting cover is fitted to each of the spring press parts at one end thereof. A tip part of each of the engaging members is pressed and biased so as to protrude inwardly to the inner surface of the setting cover via each of the holes

By the pressing and biasing each of the rotation stoppers is pressed against a setting cover notch provided on a supporting part of setting cover of the engaging member located below the mounting part of the setting cover so that forward and backward movement of each of the engaging members is restricted.

Incidentally a direction indicated by R in is a direction in which each of the engaging members protrudes inwardly from the inner surface of the setting cover by being biased by the torsion coil spring and is referred to as an engaging direction container holding direction . When the engaging members move in the engaging direction R the tip parts of the engaging members are respectively engaged with engaged openings serving as guiding portions axial restrictors longitudinal restrictors axial regulators axial positioners or axial guides of container engaged portions of the toner container to be described later to thereby hold the toner container in the attached state. Furthermore a direction indicated by R in is a direction in which each of the engaging members is retracted from the inner surface side of the setting cover against the biasing by the torsion coil springs and is referred to as a releasing direction. When the engaging members move in a releasing direction R the engagement between the tip parts of the engaging members and the engaged openings of the container engaged portions is released so that the toner container can be pulled out in the detachment direction.

Incidentally each of the tip parts includes a mountain shaped top portion P see and that is provided on the opposite side to the spring press part . The engaging members are mounted on the setting cover in a bilaterally symmetrical manner.

Regarding the setting covers the shape of the setting cover K to which the toner container K is attached differs from the shapes of the setting covers Y M C to which the toner containers Y M C are attached. As illustrated in the setting cover K includes through holes at three evenly spaced positions on a corner portion bent portion between a recess surface serving as a first back surface on the inner side in the attachment direction and the inner surface of setting cover . In contrast as illustrated in each of the setting covers Y M C includes L shaped recesses on the corner portion between the recess surface and the inner surface of setting cover but no hole is provided on the corner portion. Incidentally it may be possible to provide recesses on the setting cover K or to provide through holes on the setting covers Y M C . However in the present embodiment the recesses are provided on the setting covers Y M C to ensure the strength of the setting covers Y M C .

As described above the toner container mainly includes the container body containing toner and includes the container front end cover . is an explanatory perspective view of the toner container when the container front end cover is detached from the state illustrated in .

As illustrated in and the container body is in the form of an approximate cylinder and rotates about a central axis of the cylinder as a rotation axis. Hereinafter one side of the toner container where the receiving opening is provided the side where the container front end cover is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the toner container may be referred to as a container front end . Furthermore the other side of the toner container where the gripper is arranged the side opposite the container front end may be referred to as a container rear end . The longitudinal direction of the toner container is the rotation axis direction and corresponds to the horizontal direction when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device . The container rear side of the container body relative to the container gear has a greater outer diameter than that of the container front side and the spiral groove is provided on the inner surface of the container body. When the container body rotates in the arrow A direction in the figures a conveying force for moving toner from one end the container rear end to the other end the container front end in the rotation axis direction is applied to the toner in the container body due to the action of the spiral groove .

Scooping portions which scoop up the toner conveyed to the container front end by the spiral groove along with the rotation of the container body in the arrow A direction in the figures are provided on the inner wall of the front end of the container body . As illustrated in each of the scooping portions includes a convex and a scooping wall surface . The convex of the scooping portion rises inside the container body so as to form a ridge toward the rotation center of the container body in a spiral shape. The scooping wall surface is a downstream part of the wall surface of a portion continuing from the convex ridge of the scooping portion to the inner wall of the container body in the rotation direction of container. When the scooping wall surface is located in the lower side the scooping wall surface scoops up toner which has been entered into an inner space facing the scooping portion by the conveying force of the spiral groove along with the rotation of the container body . Therefore the toner can be scooped up so as to be located above the inserted conveying nozzle .

Furthermore as illustrated in and for example a spiral rib in a spiral shape is provided on the inner surface of each of the scooping portions in order to convey the internally located toner similarly to the spiral groove .

The container gear is provided on the container front side relative to the scooping portions on the container body . A gear exposing opening serving as a gear exposing portion is arranged on the container front end cover so that a part of the container gear the back side of can be exposed when the container front end cover is attached to the container body . In other words the container front end cover serves as a cover portion which covers a part of the container gear . When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device the container gear exposed from the gear exposing opening meshes with a container driving gear of the toner replenishing device .

The container gear is arranged on the container opening side near the container opening relative to the nozzle hole in the longitudinal direction of the container body such that the container gear can mesh with the container driving gear . The container gear meshes with the container driving gear to thereby rotate the conveyor.

The container opening in the form of a cylinder is provided on the container front side relative to the container gear of the container body so as to be coaxial with the container gear . A nozzle receiver attachment portion of the nozzle receiver is press fitted to the container opening so as to be coaxial with the container opening so that the nozzle receiver can be attached to the container body . A method to attach the nozzle receiver is not limited to press fitting. Other methods including attachment with adhesive agent or attachment with screws may be applied. Furthermore it may be possible to form a recess on the container body and insert a protrusion provided on the nozzle receiver attachment portion into the recess to enable hook fitting.

The toner container is configured such that toner is replenished from the container opening serving as the opening provided on one end of the container body and thereafter the nozzle receiver is attached to the container opening of the container body .

Cover hook stoppers serving as cover hook restrictors are provided beside the container gear on the end of the container opening of the container body . The cover hook stoppers are provided at three evenly spaced positions in the circumferential direction on the front end of the container front end cover in the attachment direction that is arranged at intervals of 120 degrees. The container front end cover is attached to the toner container the container body in the state illustrated in from the container front end from the bottom left side in . Therefore the container body penetrates through the container front end cover in the longitudinal direction and the cover hook stoppers are engaged with respective cover hooks arranged at three positions in the circumferential direction on the container front end cover . The cover hook stoppers are provided so as to surround the outer surface of the container opening and when the cover hook stoppers are engaged with the cover hooks the container body and the container front end cover are attached so as to rotate relative to each other.

The container front end cover of the toner container includes a guiding portion that guides the opening to the container setting section by restricting the toner container being attached from moving in directions other than the attachment direction when the toner container is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Meanwhile according to the functions described in the present embodiment the container front end cover may be a portion mainly used to provide the guiding portion and may be referred to as a container guide holder. As illustrated in and a pair of guiding portions for restricting movement of the container front end cover in the vertical direction are provided on both side surfaces of the lower portion of the container front end cover of the toner container . Hereinafter the pair of the guiding portions serving as vertical restrictors are referred to as sliding guides and . In other words the container cover serves as a supporter of the vertical restrictors. Each of the sliding guides and includes an upper surface A serving as an upper guide and a lower surface B serving as a lower guide each extending along the longitudinal direction of the container body . Sliding grooves and are provided between the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B respectively. Each of the sliding grooves is provided parallel to the rotation axis of the container body such that each of the guide rails and provided on the gutter of the container receiving section as illustrated in and can be sandwiched in the vertical direction. Specifically the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B sandwich the respective guide rails in the vertical direction so that the sliding guides and function as positioners of the container front end cover in a vertical direction Z and the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment detachment direction when the toner container is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus to thereby restrict the movement of the toner container in the vertical direction Z and the width direction W.

As illustrated in each of the sliding grooves is provided such that a gap in the height direction between a lower side of the upper surface A and an upper side of the lower surface B facing each other is gradually changed in the attachment direction. The gap between the upper side and the lower side is gradually increased such that a gap H

The container engaged portions are provided on an outer surface of container front end cover to determine the position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device in the axial direction. When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device the replenishing device engaging members arranged on the setting cover are engaged with the respective container engaged portions .

As illustrated in and each of the container engaged portions includes a guiding protrusion a guiding groove a bump serving as a force converting portion and the quadrangular engaged opening . Two sets of the container engaged portions are arranged on left and right sides of the container cover respectively where one set of the container engaged portion includes the guiding protrusion the guiding groove the bump and the engaged opening as described above. Each of the guiding protrusions is arranged on the container front end of the container cover so as to be located on a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container and on a horizontal plane passing through the rotation axis of the container body . Each of the guiding protrusions serving as guiding members includes a guiding inclined surface that is an inclined surface adjoined to each of the guiding grooves so as to come in contact with the replenishing device engaging members . And each of the guiding protrusions guides the engaging members to the guiding grooves when the toner container is attached. As illustrated in each of the guiding inclined surfaces is provided such that a tip of the container front side is located on the inner side relative to the outer surface of container cover and is extended to each of the guiding grooves arranged on the outer surface of container cover . Each of the guiding grooves is a groove provided on the outer surface of container cover and is a sliding surface on which the top portion P of the tip part of each of the engaging members slides.

The width of each of the guiding grooves in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the grooves is set to be slightly wider than the width of each of the engaging members in the same direction such that the engaging members do not come off from the guiding grooves when the guiding grooves guides the engaging members . Each of the guiding grooves extends in the longitudinal direction and the container rear end side of the guiding groove is adjoined to the bump with the same height as the outer surface of container cover . In other words the outer surface of the container cover with a width of about 1 mm is located between each of the guiding grooves and each of the engaged openings

The tip parts of the engaging members pass over the bumps and are entered into and engaged with dropped in the engaged openings so that the toner container is set in engaged with the toner replenishing device . This state is the attached state of the toner container .

Incidentally each of the engaged openings is not limited to the through hole but may have a closed end shape with a depth in which each of the engaging members can move to the initial position in the rotation direction to be described later with reference to . In other words it may be possible to employ a concave such that one side of the engaged opening of the container cover closer to the circumferential surface of the container body is closed as long as the movement of the engaging members to the initial position to be described later with reference to is not interrupted.

In the container shutter is located in the center of a segment LL connecting the two container engaged portions on a virtual plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. If the container shutter is not located on the segment LL connecting the two container engaged portions the following situations may occur. Specifically due to biasing forces of a container shutter spring serving as a biasing member and the nozzle shutter spring a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container about the segment LL serving as the rotation axis where the moment arm is a distance from the segment LL to the container shutter . Due to the action of the moment of force the toner container may be inclined with respect to the toner replenishing device . In this case an attachment load on the toner container increases so that a load is applied to the nozzle receiver that holds and guides the container shutter . In particular if the toner container is new and adequately filled with toner and when the toner container is pushed from the rear side so as to insert the conveying nozzle protruding in the horizontal direction a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container with the weight of toner added. Therefore a load is applied to the nozzle receiver in which the conveying nozzle is inserted and the nozzle receiver may be deformed or broken in the worst case. In contrast in the toner container according to the present embodiment the container shutter is located on the segment LL connecting the two container engaged portions . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being inclined with respect to the toner replenishing device due to the biasing forces of the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring that act at the position of the container shutter .

The container rotating part serving as a driving part inputs rotation drive to the container gear of the toner container via the container driving gear . When the drive is input to the container gear the outer surface of container opening of the container body functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of container setting section functions as a bearing so that the container body in which the container gear is provided or integrated is rotated. Incidentally in the present embodiment the rotation center of the container gear is located so as to be concentric with the axis of the container opening

Furthermore when the drive is input to the container gear due to the mesh between the container driving gear and the container gear a force is applied in a direction of the pressure angle of the container gear an angle between a radial line and a tooth profile at a single point pitch point on the tooth surface based on Japanese Industrial Standards JIS so that the container gear rotates. The force applied in the direction of the pressure angle of the container gear is resolved into a component in a direction toward the rotation center of the container gear so that a force in the direction toward the central axis rotation axis of the container body and perpendicular to the central axis is added to the toner container including the container body .

If the force is applied in the direction perpendicular to the central axis of the toner container as described above the posture of the toner container in the longitudinal direction becomes unstable and the toner container may be inclined with respect to the central axis. As a result the meshing state between the container driving gear and the container gear may become unstable noise may be generated due to the unstable meshing state or a toner conveying failure may occur.

As described above because the outer surface of container opening that is the front end of the toner container serves as the rotational shaft and is supported by the inner surface of container setting section an unstable meshing state noise due to the unstable meshing state or the toner conveying failure is likely to occur when the container gear is located on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions . This is because it is expected that a rotational moment as described below is generated. First an explanation is given of a rotational moment generated on the container opening of the toner container when the toner container is set in the replenishing device and a driving force is transmitted to the container gear . On the container opening of the toner container a rotational moment M is generated due to the force driving force applied in the direction perpendicular to the rotation axis of the container gear so that the engagement between the container opening and the container setting section becomes unstable. In contrast the engaged openings of the container engaged portions of the toner container are held by the replenishing device engaging members . By the holding by the engaging members a rotational moment M is generated on the container opening in a direction in which the rotational moment due to the driving force of the container gear as described above is cancelled out.

If the container gear is located on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions the length of the arm of the rotational moment M a distance from the container opening to the container gear in the rotation axis direction becomes longer than the length of the arm of the rotational moment M a distance from the container opening to the engaged opening in the rotation axis direction . That is M M so that the holding of the toner container and the container front end cover by the toner container holder may become unstable.

In contrast according to the present embodiment as illustrated in and the container gear is arranged between the container engaged portions and the container opening in the central axis direction longitudinal direction of the toner container . Therefore the length of the arm of the rotational moment M becomes longer than the length of the arm of the rotational moment M so that M M. Therefore the influence of the rotational moment M due to the force driving force applied in the direction perpendicular to the central axis of the toner container can be reduced the toner container holder can stably hold the toner container and the container front end cover and the posture of the toner container in the longitudinal direction can be maintained stably.

Detailed explanations will be given below. When the toner container is held by the toner container holder the set state the toner container is set such that the outer surface of container opening that is the front end of the toner container serves as the rotational shaft and is supported by the inner surface of container setting section while the engaged openings of the container engaged portions are engaged with the replenishing device engaging members . Furthermore the container gear is arranged between the container engaged portions and the container opening

Therefore the length of the arm of the rotational moment M due to the force applied to the toner container in the direction perpendicular to the central axis caused by the mesh between the container driving gear and the container gear is the same as the length from the position at which the outer surface of container opening is supported by the inner surface of container setting section to the position at which the container gear is arranged in the central axis direction longitudinal direction . Furthermore the length of the arm of the rotational moment M due to the force referred to as a holding force applied to the toner container in the direction perpendicular to the central axis caused by the engagement between the engaged openings of the container engaged portions and the replenishing device engaging members is the same as the length from the position at which the outer surface of container opening is supported by the inner surface of container setting section to the position at which the engaged openings of the container engaged portions are arranged in the central axis direction longitudinal direction .

Incidentally the rotational moment is obtained by multiplying the length of the arm of the rotational moment by the magnitude of the force. Therefore when the container gear is arranged on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions a greater holding force is needed than in the configuration in which the container gear is arranged between the container engaged portions and the container opening

Therefore assuming that the holding force as described above is constant it becomes possible to effectively apply the holding force of the toner container holder to hold the toner container and the container front end cover in the configuration in which the container gear is arranged between the container engaged portions and the container opening as compared to the configuration in which the container gear is arranged on the container rear side relative to the container engaged portions . As a result even when the driving force is transmitted to the container gear it becomes possible to stably maintain the posture of the toner container in the longitudinal direction.

When the toner container is held by the toner container holder as illustrated in and a reaction force F restoring force to compress the container shutter spring and a reaction force F caused by compression of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container . As illustrated in and each of the cover hooks arranged at three evenly spaced positions in the circumferential direction of the container front end cover receives a component of the reaction force F i.e. of F from the toner container via a surface of the cover hook stopper of the toner container on the container rear side. Resultant forces of the reaction forces F and F are applied to the container front end cover evenly and with equal radial distances to the central axis O rotation axis of the toner container so that only a component in the central axis rotation axis direction mainly acts. Namely a component that causes the container front end cover to be inclined with respect to the central axis O rotation axis can hardly act.

Furthermore as illustrated in the container engaged portions are arranged at horizontally symmetrical positions with respect to the central axis O rotation axis so that components in the direction perpendicular to the central axis O are cancelled out. Therefore only a component in the central axis direction acts but a component that inclines the container front end cover with respect to the central axis O does not act.

In the container front end cover an inner surface of a front end of the container front end cover comes in contact with an outer edge of the cover hook stopper serving as a cover hook restrictor on the container front side relative to front ends of the cover hooks . Therefore the radial position of the toner container relative to the container front end cover is determined.

Specifically the toner container serving as the powder container of the present embodiment is attachable to an image forming apparatus. The image forming apparatus is configured such that the toner container containing toner for image formation is attached thereto and includes the conveying nozzle serving as a conveyor for conveying toner the nozzle shutter serving as a nozzle opening closing member that opens and closes the nozzle hole serving as the powder receiving hole arranged on the conveying nozzle the nozzle shutter spring serving as a biasing member that biases the nozzle shutter to close the nozzle hole the replenishing device engaging members that apply biasing forces to the sides of the toner container to hold the toner container with respect to the main body of the image forming apparatus the container driving gear serving as an apparatus main body gear to transmit a driving force to the conveyor in the toner container and the container setting section serving as the container receiving section that is arranged around the conveying nozzle so as to be coaxial with the conveying nozzle and that receives the toner container . The toner container includes the container body for storing toner for image formation the opening arranged on one end of the toner container the conveyor that rotates to convey powder inside the container body to the container opening side the container gear serving as a gear to mesh with the container driving gear to drive the conveyor the container engaged portions engaged with the replenishing device engaging members and the container front end cover serving as a container cover arranged on the outer surface of the toner container so as to be coaxial with the toner container . The center of the opening and the rotation center of the container gear are located on the same axis. The container driving gear is arranged between the container engaged portions and the container opening in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . The opening is able to mate with the container setting section .

With the configuration as described above the toner container can be held in a stable posture in the radial direction and the axial direction with respect to the toner replenishing device . If the container gear is arranged between the opening and the container engaged portions in the longitudinal direction of the toner container a stable state is maintained because of a balance between the forces in the central axis direction. Therefore the influence of the force generated at the engaged portion between the container driving gear and the container gear is reduced so that it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being inclined in the longitudinal direction in the central axis direction . Consequently it becomes possible to prevent the meshing state between the container driving gear Y and the container gear from becoming unstable prevent noise due to the unstable meshing state and prevent a toner conveying failure.

Meanwhile according to the functions of the present embodiment the container front end cover may be a portion mainly used to provide the container engaged portions and may be referred to as a container engaged portion holder.

As illustrated in and the cover hooks are arranged at three evenly spaced positions in the circumferential direction on a front end surface of the container front end cover . At bent portions of the cover hooks protrusions are provided which serve as guiding portions radial restrictors radial regulators radial positioning portions radial positioners or radial guides and which protrude outward from the outer surface of container front end cover . The protrusions are bent along the bent portions of the container front end cover and arranged at three evenly spaced positions in the circumferential direction of the container front end cover that is at intervals of 120 degrees. The protrusions protrude 0.9 mm from the outer surface of container front end cover and extend 4 mm from the bent portions in each of the radial direction and the longitudinal direction. As illustrated in the protrusions serving as the guiding portions have functions to guide the movement of the toner container and determine the position of the toner container in the radial direction by coming into contact with the inner surface of setting cover when the container front end cover is entered into the container cover receiving section . Each of the protrusions is provided with a rounded shape so as to come in point contact with the inner surface of setting cover to reduce the sliding resistance. The protrusions are arranged so as to face the respective through holes or recesses see and provided at three positions on the setting cover . The protrusions are also arranged so as to come in contact with the inner surface of setting cover before the container opening of the container body comes in contact with the nozzle shutter flange . Therefore the protrusions function as radial positioners of the toner container with respect to the toner replenishing device by coming into contact with the inner surface of setting cover . Namely the protrusions function as guiding portions radial restrictors radial regulators radial positioners radial guides or radial positioners.

As illustrated in a plate shaped circumferential restricting portion serving as a circumferential restrictor as the guiding portion is arranged on the outer surface of container front end cover . Hereinafter the circumferential restricting portion is described as a rotation restrictive rib that serves as a rotation restrictive portion a rotation restrictive protrusion a guiding portion a circumferential restrictor a circumferential regulator a circumferential positioner or circumferential guide. The rotation restrictive rib and one of the sliding guides are provided to be integrated with the container front end cover . The rotation restrictive rib is arranged between the two protrusions located in the lower portion and protrudes in a radially outward direction from the outer surface of the container front end cover . The rotation restrictive rib is arranged so as to be entered into the groove provided on the setting cover see when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device . The rotation restrictive rib protrudes from a downstream end surface of one of the sliding guides in the attachment direction and is integrated with the one of the sliding guides . The rotation restrictive rib is arranged so as to protrude from the one of the sliding guides and be located at approximately the same height as the sliding groove . Therefore even if the sliding guides are entered in a slightly deviated manner with respect to the guide rails when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device a deviation in the position of the rotation restrictive rib with respect to the groove of the setting cover can be reduced and the rotation restrictive rib can easily be entered into the groove of the setting cover. Therefore it becomes possible to reliably determine the position in the circumferential direction.

As illustrated in and the upward guide is arranged on the container front end cover so as to protrude upward from the outer surface of container cover in the attached state. On the upward guide a top portion of upward guide side portions of upward guide and inclined surfaces of upward guide are provided. The top portion of upward guide and the side portions of upward guide extend in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . The side portions of upward guide are provided on both sides of the top portion of upward guide so as to be deviated downward from the top portion of the upward guide in the circumferential direction of the container front end cover . The inclined surfaces of upward guide are inclined downward from the top portion of upward guide and the side portions of upward guide of the toner container to the container rear side.

The container body is molded by a biaxial stretch blow molding method. The biaxial stretch blow molding method generally includes a two stage process including a preform molding process and a stretch blow molding process. In the preform molding process a test tube shaped preform is molded with resin by injection molding. By the injection molding the container opening the cover hook stoppers and the container gear are provided at the opening of the test tube shape preform. In the stretch blow molding process the preform that is cooled after the preform molding process and detached from a mold is heated and softened and then subjected to blow molding and stretching.

In the container body the container rear side relative to the container gear is molded by the stretch blow molding process. Specifically a portion in which the spiral groove is provided and the gripper are molded by the stretch blow molding process.

In the container body each of the portions such as the container gear the container opening and the cover hook stoppers provided on the container front side relative to the container gear remains in the same form as in the preform generated by the injection molding therefore they can be molded with high accuracy. In contrast the portion in which the spiral groove is provided and the gripper are molded by stretching through the stretch blow molding process after the injection molding therefore the molding accuracy is lower than that of the preform molded portions.

The nozzle receiver includes a container shutter supporter serving as a supporter the container shutter a container seal serving as a seal the container shutter spring serving as a biasing member and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The container shutter supporter includes a shutter rear end supporting portion as a shutter rear portion shutter side supporting portions as shutter side portions the openings of shutter supporting portion as shutter side openings of the shutter supporting portion and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The container shutter spring includes a coil spring.

The shutter side supporting portions and the openings of shutter supporting portion on the container shutter supporter are arranged adjacent to each other in the rotation direction of the toner container such that the two shutter side supporting portions facing each other form a part of a cylindrical shape and the cylindrical shape is largely cut out at the openings two portions of shutter supporting portion . With this shape it is possible to cause the container shutter to move in the longitudinal direction in a cylindrical space S defined by the cylindrical shape.

The nozzle receiver provided to the container body rotates with the container body when the container body rotates. At this time the shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver rotate around the conveying nozzle of the toner replenishing device . Therefore the shutter side supporting portions being rotated alternately pass a space just above the nozzle hole provided in the upper side of the conveying nozzle . Consequently even if toner is instantaneously accumulated above the nozzle hole because the shutter side supporting portions cross the accumulated toner and alleviate the accumulation it becomes possible to prevent a cohesion of the accumulated toner when the device is not used and prevent a toner conveying failure when the device is resumed. In contrast when the shutter side supporting portions are located on the sides of the conveying nozzle and the nozzle hole and the opening of shutter supporting portion face each other toner in the container body is supplied to the conveying nozzle as indicated by an arrow in .

In the conventional toner container in which the container gear is located on the side opposite the opening relative to the powder receiving hole in the longitudinal direction of the toner container the diameter of a portion where the container gear is provided needs to be smaller than those of the other portions of the container body in order to attach and detach the toner container and to couple and drive the container gear and the container driving gear of the main body. Therefore a so called shoulder portion is provided to pass over the small diameter portion and toner is moved from the inside of the container body to the opening.

In contrast according to the present embodiment the container gear is coupled and driven with the container driving gear at a position on the opening side arranged on one end of the container body relative to the nozzle hole in the longitudinal direction of the toner container . Therefore the conveying nozzle can receive toner on the inner side of the container body relative to the position small diameter position at which the container gear is provided. Consequently it becomes possible to transfer toner more smoothly as compared to the conventional configuration.

The container shutter includes a front cylindrical portion serving as a closure a slide area a guiding rod and shutter hooks . The front cylindrical portion is a container front end portion to be tightly fitted to a cylindrical opening the receiving opening of the container seal . The slide area is a cylindrical portion which is provided on the container rear side relative to the front cylindrical portion . The slide area has an outer diameter slightly greater than that of the front cylindrical portion and slides on the inner surfaces of the pair of the shutter side supporting portions

The guiding rod is a cylinder that stands from the inner side of the cylinder of the front cylindrical portion toward the container rear end and serves a rod portion that prevents the container shutter spring from being buckled when the guiding rod is inserted to the inside of the coil of the container shutter spring .

A guiding rod sliding portion includes a pair of flat surfaces that are provided on both sides across the central axis of the cylindrical guiding rod from the middle of the guiding rod . Furthermore the container rear end of the guiding rod sliding portion is bifurcated into a pair of cantilevers

The shutter hooks are a pair of hooks that are provided on ends of the cantilevers opposite the base from which the guiding rod stands and that prevent the container shutter from coming off from the container shutter supporter .

As illustrated in a front end of the container shutter spring abuts against the inner wall of the front cylindrical portion and a rear end of the container shutter spring abuts against the wall of the shutter rear end supporting portion . At this time the container shutter spring is in a compressed state so that the container shutter receives a biasing force in a direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion to the right or toward the container front end in . However the shutter hooks provided on the container rear end of the container shutter are hooked on an outer wall of the shutter rear end supporting portion . Therefore the container shutter is prevented from moving further in the direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion in the state illustrated in and .

Due to the hooked state between the shutter hooks and the shutter rear end supporting portion and the biasing force of the container shutter spring the positioning is performed. Specifically the longitudinal positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal both of which implement a toner leakage preventing function of the container shutter are determined relative to the container shutter supporter . Therefore it becomes possible to determine the positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal so that they can be fitted to each other enabling to prevent toner leakage.

The nozzle receiver attachment portion is in the form of a cylinder whose outer diameter and inner diameter are reduced in a stepped manner toward the container rear end. The diameters are gradually reduced from the container front end to the container rear end. As illustrated in two outer diameter portions outer surfaces AA and BB located in this order from the container front end are present on the outer surface and five inner diameter portions inner surfaces CC DD EE FF and GG located in this order from the container front end are present on the inner surface. The outer surfaces AA and BB on the outer surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. Similarly the fourth inner diameter portion FF and the fifth inner diameter portion GG on the inner surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. The inner diameter portion FF on the inner surface and the connected tapered surface correspond to a seal jam preventing space to be described later and the ridge lines of these surfaces correspond to sides of a pentagonal cross section to be described later.

As illustrated in to the pair of the shutter side supporting portions which face each other and which have flake shapes obtained by cutting a cylinder in the axial direction protrude from the nozzle receiver attachment portion toward the container rear end. The ends of the two shutter side supporting portions on the container rear side are connected to the shutter rear end supporting portion that has a cup shape with a circular opening in the center of the bottom. The two shutter side supporting portions face to each other and thus the cylindrical space S is defined by inner cylindrical surfaces of the shutter side supporting portions and virtual cylindrical surfaces extending from the shutter side supporting portions . The nozzle receiver attachment portion includes the inner diameter portion GG which is the fifth portion from the front end as a cylindrical inner surface having the same inner diameter as the diameter of the cylindrical space S. The slide area of the container shutter slides on the cylindrical space S and the cylindrical inner surface GG. The third inner surface EE of the nozzle receiver attachment portion is a virtual circumferential surface that passes through longitudinal tips of nozzle shutter positioning ribs that serve as abutting portions or convex portions and that are equally spaced at 45 . The container seal with a quadrangular cylindrical cylindrical tube shaped cross section the cross section in the cross sectional view in is arranged so as to correspond to the inner surface EE. The container seal is attached to a vertical surface connecting the third inner surface EE and the fourth inner surface FF with adhesive agent or double stick tape. The exposed surface of the container seal opposite the attachment surface the right side in and serves as an inner bottom of the cylindrical opening of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion the container opening .

Furthermore as illustrated in and the seal jam preventing space a catch preventing space is defined so as to correspond to the inner surface FF of the nozzle receiver attachment portion and the connected tapered surface. The seal jam preventing space is an annular sealed space enclosed by three different parts. Specifically the seal jam preventing space is an annular space enclosed by the inner surface the fourth inner surface FF and the connected tapered surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion the vertical surface on the attachment side of the container seal and the outer surface from the front cylindrical portion to the slide area of the container shutter . A cross section of the annular space the cross section illustrated in and is in the form of a pentagon. The angle between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion and the end surface of the container seal and the angle between the outer surface of the container shutter and the end surface of the container seal are 90 .

Functions of the seal jam preventing space will be described below. When the container shutter moves toward the container rear end from the state in which the receiving opening is closed by the container shutter the inner surface of the container seal slides against the front cylindrical portion of the container shutter . Therefore the inner surface of the container seal is pulled by the container shutter and elastically deformed so as to move toward the container rear end.

At this time if the seal jam preventing space is not provided but the vertical surface the attachment surface of the container seal continuing from the third inner surface is connected to the fifth inner surface GG so as to be perpendicular to each other the following situation may occur. Specifically the elastically deformed portion of the container seal may be caught between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion sliding against the container shutter and the outer surface of the container shutter resulting in causing a jam. If the container seal is jammed in the portion where the nozzle receiver attachment portion and the container shutter slide against each other that is between the front cylindrical portion and the inner surface GG the container shutter is firmly attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion so that the receiving opening may not be opened and closed.

In contrast the nozzle receiver according to the present embodiment is provided with the seal jam preventing space in the inner area thereof. The inner diameter of the seal jam preventing space the inner diameter of each of the inner surface EE and the connected tapered surface is smaller than the outer diameter of the container seal . Therefore the entire container seal can hardly be entered into the seal jam preventing space . Furthermore an area of the container seal to be elastically deformed by being pulled by the container shutter is limited and the container seal can be restored by its own elasticity before the container seal is brought to and jammed at the inner surface GG. With this action it becomes possible to prevent a situation in which the receiving opening cannot be opened and closed because of the attached state between the container shutter and the nozzle receiver attachment portion .

As illustrated in to the multiple nozzle shutter positioning ribs are provided so as to radially extend on the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion that comes in contact with the outer periphery of the container seal . As illustrated in and when the container seal is attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion the vertical surface of the container seal on the container front side slightly protrudes relative to the front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs in the longitudinal direction.

As illustrated in when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter of the toner replenishing device presses and deforms the protruding portion of the container seal by being biased by the nozzle shutter spring . The nozzle shutter flange further moves inward and abuts against the container front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs thereby covering and sealing the front end surface of the container seal from the outside of the container. Therefore it becomes possible to ensure the sealing performance in the periphery of the conveying nozzle at the receiving opening in the attached state enabling to prevent toner leakage.

The back side of a biased surface of the nozzle shutter flange biased by the nozzle shutter spring abuts against the nozzle shutter positioning ribs so that the position of the nozzle shutter relative to the toner container in the longitudinal direction is determined. Therefore a positional relationship of the front end surface of the container seal the front end surface of a front end opening an inner space of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion arranged in the container opening as will be described later and the nozzle shutter in the longitudinal direction is determined.

The operation of the container shutter and the conveying nozzle will be explained below with reference to and . Before the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device as illustrated in the container shutter is biased by the container shutter spring toward a closing position so as to close the receiving opening . The appearance of the container shutter and the conveying nozzle at this time is illustrated in . When the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device as illustrated in the conveying nozzle is inserted in the receiving opening . When the toner container is further pushed into the toner replenishing device an end surface of the front cylindrical portion which serves as an end surface of the container shutter hereinafter referred to as the end surface of the container shutter and a front end that is an end surface of the conveying nozzle in the insertion direction hereinafter referred to as the front end of the conveying nozzle come in contact with each other. When the toner container is further pushed from the state as described above the container shutter is pushed as illustrated in . Accordingly the conveying nozzle is inserted in the shutter rear end supporting portion from the receiving opening as illustrated in . Therefore as illustrated in the conveying nozzle is inserted in the container body and located at a setting position. At this time as illustrated in the nozzle hole is located at a position overlapping the opening of shutter supporting portion

Subsequently when the container body is rotated toner scooped up above the conveying nozzle by the scooping portions falls in and is introduced into the conveying nozzle via the nozzle hole . The toner introduced into the conveying nozzle is conveyed inside the conveying nozzle toward the toner dropping passage along with the rotation of the conveying screw . Subsequently the toner falls in and is supplied to the developing device through the toner dropping passage .

In the relationship between the toner container and the toner replenishing device according to the present embodiment the conveying nozzle is inserted to a position by penetrating through the inside of the container gear in the longitudinal direction of the container body . Namely the container gear meshes with the container driving gear at a position closer to the opening than the nozzle hole in the longitudinal direction of the container body in a state in which the toner container is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Therefore if the rotation drive is input to the container gear via the container driving gear in a direction A indicated in a force generated at the position where the container driving gear and the container gear mesh with each other is applied to the container body the conveying nozzle or the nozzle receiver that extend inside the container body . Therefore the conveying nozzle or the nozzle receiver may be damaged or a gap may be generated between the conveying nozzle and the nozzle receiver resulting in toner leakage.

Furthermore by causing the toner container to slide in the attachment direction Q pushing direction on the toner container holder the conveying nozzle of the toner replenishing device pushes open the container shutter inside the receiving opening of the toner container and is entered into the container body . Therefore if the relative position is deviated during the movement toner leakage may occur or the conveying nozzle the container shutter or the nozzle receiver may be damaged. Therefore it is desirable to perform the movement while the centers of the conveying nozzle the container shutter and the receiving opening are located on the same axis as best as possible.

Furthermore the rotation center of the container gear is on the same line as the axis of the container opening the container body . Therefore to mesh the container gear with the container driving gear at a correct position without causing gear mesh fault it is important to determine the radial position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device by mating the container opening to the container setting section .

For example while it may be possible to restrict the positional relationship between the toner container and the toner replenishing device by uniformly using a long guide extending in the axial direction of the toner container if the number of directions to be restricted is small it becomes difficult to achieve adequate regulation. Alternatively it may be possible to provide multiple restrictors so as to determine the positional relationship between the toner container and the toner replenishing device from the beginning of the attachment. However in this case positioning movement restriction is performed by the multiple restrictors from an early stage of the movement in the attachment direction Q pushing direction so that a push resistance increases and the operability may be degraded.

Therefore in the present embodiment the container opening is to mate with the container setting section arranged around the conveying nozzle and the position of the toner container relative to the toner replenishing device is determined by causing the container opening and the container setting section to mate with each other. Therefore it becomes possible to stabilize the relative position of the toner container and the toner replenishing device and to reduce the influence of the force generated at the meshing portion between the container driving gear and the container gear .

Furthermore as illustrated in a positioning portion serving as a guiding portion to enable restriction and release with respect to the toner replenishing device in the attachment direction Q of the toner container is arranged on the toner container . Therefore it becomes possible to move the toner container toward the toner replenishing device in the attachment direction Q while the centers of the conveying nozzle and the nozzle receiver are located on the same axis as best as possible. Consequently it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage and prevent the conveying nozzle and the nozzle receiver from being damaged. Incidentally the positioning portion includes multiple positioners restrictors or regulators arranged in the attachment direction Q. While is a perspective view for explaining the positional relationship between the multiple positioners and the toner replenishing device the configurations of the multiple positioners are mainly illustrated and other configurations are omitted or simplified to avoid complication.

The positioning portion performs positioning restricts movement in a predetermined direction by using the container front end cover that defines an external shape of the toner container when the toner container is being moved in the attachment direction Q on the toner container holder . The positioning portion performs positioning by using the container opening of the container body that defines an internal shape of the toner container when the toner container is located in the setting position in the toner replenishing device . Incidentally the positioning portion serving as the guiding portion restricts movement in any of directions other than the attachment direction Q of the toner container when the toner container is being moved in the attachment direction Q on the toner container holder to thereby guide the toner container to the toner replenishing device . Specifically when the toner container is attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus the guiding portion restricts the movement of the toner container in a direction other than the attachment direction while the toner container is being moved and guides the opening to the container setting section .

In the positioning portion the pair of the sliding guides and the engaged openings the multiple three protrusions the rotation restrictive rib and the container opening serve as positioners. Of these components the sliding guides and and the engaged openings the multiple three protrusions are integrally provided and arranged on the container front end cover that is made of resin. The container opening is integrated with the container body .

The order of restriction and release of all of the positioners with respect to the toner replenishing device will be described below. First as illustrated in when a user places the toner container on the gutter of the container receiving section of the toner container holder and pushes the toner container in the attachment direction Q performs attachment operation the toner container slides on the gutter . At this time as illustrated in the toner container slides while the side portions of upward guide of the toner container come in contact with the projections provided on the ceiling surface facing the gutter . Therefore the toner container can be pushed in the attachment direction Q while the movement in the vertical direction Z is restricted. Furthermore the movement in the vertical direction is restricted not by the top portion of upward guide but by the side portions of upward guide provided on the both sides of the top portion of upward guide . Therefore even when the toner container is deviated in the horizontal direction during the attaching operation the toner container can reliably be brought into contact with the ceiling surface side.

On the toner replenishing device side as illustrated in the front of the sliding groove serving as the first guides are entered into the most upstream side of the respective guide rail in the attachment direction Q. Due to the entrance of the front of the sliding groove into the guide rail the sliding guide get on the guide rail and the toner container that has been in contact with the top surface of the gutter is lifted upward. The guide rails and are provided on the side surfaces and of the gutter so as to be spaced apart from the mounting surface of the gutter . Therefore by causing the front of the sliding groove to enter into the guide rail it becomes possible to roughly determine the positions in the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and in the vertical direction Z. This state will be described as a first restricted state. and are diagrams illustrating the first restricted state. is a side view illustrating the first restricted state. is a diagram of a portion on a reference line X in viewed from the attachment direction. is a diagram of a portion on a reference line X in viewed from above. Incidentally the reference line X illustrated in indicates the position of the end surface of the container front end cover and the same applies to the other figures described below.

When the toner container in the first restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q as illustrated in the end surface of the container shutter and the front end of the conveying nozzle come in contact with each other. In the first restricted state the sliding guides and the guide rails regulate the width direction W and the vertical direction Z so that the container shutter can face the conveying nozzle as desired and the positional relationship between the receiving opening and the conveying nozzle can be ensured. By ensuring the positional relationship between the receiving opening and the conveying nozzle it becomes possible to prevent the container seal from being detached or damaged due to insertion of the container shutter into the conveying nozzle in a deviated manner.

When the toner container in this state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a second restricted state as illustrated in and is obtained. In the second restricted state the front end of the container front end cover is entered into the container cover receiving section . Due to the entrance of the front end of the container front end cover into the container cover receiving section the three protrusions provided at evenly spaced circumferential positions on the outer surface of a front end of container front end cover in the attachment direction come in contact with from the inner side the inner surface of setting cover being a part of the container cover receiving section . It is preferable to form at least three protrusions as the protrusions but the number of the protrusions is not limited to three.

Due to the contact between the protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover the movement of the toner container is guided and the radial movement of the toner container is restricted. The radial direction Ra along which radial movement may occur is illustrated in . Therefore in the second restricted state the radial movement of the container front end cover relative to the container cover receiving section is restricted by the contact between the three protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover . Namely the radial position of the container front end cover relative to the container cover receiving section is restricted. Meanwhile the regulation of the position in a predetermined direction means restriction of the movement of the toner container in the predetermined direction.

When the toner container in the second restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the container seal and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in . In the second restricted state the radial direction is restricted by the protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover in addition to the regulation in the width direction W and the vertical direction Z by the guide rails and the sliding guides therefore the centers of the container shutter and the conveying nozzle coincide with each other. Accordingly it becomes possible to prevent the attachment operation from being performed when the toner container is inclined in the width direction W or the vertical direction Z with respect to a contact surface between the end surface of the container shutter and the front end of the conveying nozzle or with respect to the sliding guides . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the conveying nozzle and the container shutter from being broken or prevent the container seal from being detached. Furthermore a force applied to the sliding guides due to the attachment operation is distributed to the protrusions so that the force can be reduced. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent a defect such as breakage or damage of the sliding guides .

When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q in the state in which the container seal and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in the fronts of the sliding grooves come off from the guide rails and the restriction in the vertical direction Z is implemented by the centers of the sliding grooves serving as second guides of the sliding grooves as illustrated in . When the toner container in this state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a third restricted state as illustrated in to FIG. is obtained. In the third restricted state the rotation restrictive rib provided on the outer surface of the front end of the container front end cover are entered into the groove of the setting cover as illustrated in . Therefore the container front end cover and the setting cover the container cover receiving section are integrated and the circumferential movement is additionally restricted by the container front end cover . At this time because the vertical direction Z is restricted by the centers having wider gaps than those of the fronts of the sliding grooves sliding resistance during the insertion can be reduced which is preferable in terms of the operability.

When the toner container in the third restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a fourth restricted state as illustrated in is obtained. In the fourth restricted state the three protrusions on the container front end cover are located opposite the through holes provided on the setting cover K or the recesses of the setting cover Y M C . Therefore the protrusions are entered into the through holes of the setting cover K or be located inside the recess of the setting cover Y M C and the radial restriction of the container front end cover by the protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover is released.

When the toner container in the fourth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a fifth restricted state as illustrated in and is obtained. In the fifth restricted state as illustrated in the front end of the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section the setting cover serving as a positioner of the container setting section. Therefore the container body is rotatably supported inside the inner surface of container setting section . At this time the circumferential position of the container front end cover is restricted by the rotation restrictive rib and the groove of the setting cover so that the container opening and the container setting section can be mate with each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section in a deviated manner. Furthermore when the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section the radial restriction by the protrusions is already released so that the circumferential restriction by the rotation restrictive rib is not interfered.

When the toner container in the fifth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a sixth restricted state as illustrated in and is obtained. In the sixth restricted state the container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section and the replenishing device engaging members and are entered into and engaged with the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions and as illustrated in . Therefore the toner container is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction the rotation axis direction and is maintained in the setting position.

Incidentally a backlash may be provided in the positions in which the replenishing device engaging members and are entered into the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions and in the longitudinal direction. With this it becomes possible to cause the replenishing device engaging members and to be reliably entered into the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions and and to prevent a defective setting of the toner container in the toner replenishing device even when the accuracies of components or mount positions of components vary which is a preferable configuration.

As described above the positional relationship between the toner container and the toner replenishing device can be determined by restricting and releasing the toner container and the toner replenishing device in the stepped manner along with the movement of the toner container in the attachment direction Q relative to the toner replenishing device . Therefore it becomes possible to stabilize the positions of the centers of the conveying nozzle the container shutter and the receiving opening . Therefore it becomes possible to improve the operability in the attachment operation prevent breakage of the conveying nozzle the container shutter or the receiving opening and prevent toner leakage.

The toner container differs from the toner container explained in the first embodiment in that the container body is configured in a different manner but the other configurations are the same as those of the toner container . Therefore the configuration of the container body will be mainly explained below.

The container body is a cylindrical member made of resin. The container body stores therein toner serving as powder developer and includes a conveyor inside thereof. A scooping function is provided in a part of the conveyor. The configuration will be explained below with reference to . is a perspective view of the nozzle receiver integrated with scooping ribs corresponding to the scooping wall surfaces hereinafter the nozzle receiver is referred to as a nozzle receiver . is a cross sectional view for explaining a relationship between the nozzle receiver illustrated in and the conveying nozzle when the nozzle receiver is arranged inside the container body . is an explanatory lateral cross sectional view of the entire toner container on which the nozzle receiver illustrated in is mounted. is a perspective view of a container shutter as a part of the toner container .

The nozzle receiver illustrated in includes the scooping ribs as described above and is integrated with a conveying blade holder to which conveying blades made of a flexible material such as a resin film are provided.

Furthermore the nozzle receiver illustrated in includes a container seal serving as a seal a receiving opening serving as a nozzle insertion opening the container shutter and a container shutter spring serving as a biasing member. The container seal is a seal including a front surface that faces and comes in contact with the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter held by the conveying nozzle when the toner container is attached to the main body of the copier . The receiving opening is an opening in which the conveying nozzle is inserted. The container shutter is a shutter that opens and closes the receiving opening . The container shutter spring is a biasing member that biases the container shutter to a closing position so as to close the receiving opening .

Moreover in the configuration illustrated in the nozzle receiver includes an outer surface that slidably mates with the inner surface of container setting section of the main body of the copier illustrated in . Furthermore as illustrated in the container shutter includes a contact portion that comes in contact with the conveying nozzle and includes shutter supporting portions . The shutter supporting portions extend from the contact portion in the longitudinal direction of the container body and include hook portions that prevent the container shutter from coming off from the nozzle receiver due to biasing by the container shutter spring . The container gear provided as a separate body is provided to the nozzle receiver of the toner container such that the container gear can transmit drive.

As described above it is possible to integrate the components such as a scooping inner wall surface a bridging portion and openings of shutter supporting portion serving as shutter side openings for introducing toner to the nozzle hole .

As illustrated in the toner container includes the container front end cover the container body a rear cover serving as a rear cap the nozzle receiver and the like. The container front end cover is arranged on the front end of the toner container in the attachment direction Q with respect to the main body of the copier . The container body has an approximately cylindrical shape. The rear cover is arranged on the rear end of the toner container in the attachment direction Q. The nozzle receiver is rotatably held by the approximately cylindrical container body as described above.

The gear exposing opening see is arranged on the container front end cover in order to expose the container gear attached to the nozzle receiver . The approximately cylindrical container body holds the nozzle receiver so that the nozzle receiver can rotate. The container front end cover and the rear cover are attached to the container body by a well known method such as thermal welding or adhesive agent . The rear cover includes a rear side bearing that supports one end of the conveying blade holder and includes a gripper that a user can grip when he she attaches and detaches the toner container to and from the main body of the copier .

A method to assemble the container front end cover the rear cover and the nozzle receiver on the container body will be explained below.

The nozzle receiver is first inserted in the container body from the container rear side and positioning is performed such that the nozzle receiver is rotatably supported by a front side bearing arranged on the front end of the container body . Subsequently positioning is performed such that one end of the conveying blade holder of the nozzle receiver is rotatably supported by the rear side bearing arranged on the rear cover and the rear cover is assembled to the container body . Thereafter the container gear is assembled to the nozzle receiver from the container front side. After the container gear is assembled the container front end cover is assembled to the container body so as to cover the container gear from the container front side.

Incidentally the assembling of the container body and the container front end cover the assembling of the container body and the rear cover and the assembling of the nozzle receiver and the container gear are performed by appropriately using a well known method for example thermal welding adhesive agent or the like .

A configuration for conveying toner from the toner container to the nozzle hole will be explained below.

The scooping ribs protrude so as to come closer to the inner surface of the container body such that rib surfaces are connected from downstream side parts which are on the downstream side in the rotation direction of shutter side supporting portions serving as shutter side portions. The rib surfaces are bent once in their middle portions so as to resemble curved surfaces however the configuration is not limited to this example depending on the compatibility with toner. For example simple flat ribs without bend may be used. With this configuration it becomes not necessary to form a bulged portion in the container body . Furthermore the scooping ribs stand from the openings of shutter supporting portion in an integrated manner. Therefore it becomes possible to obtain the same bridging function and advantageous effects as those obtained in the configuration in which the shutter side supporting portions and the convexes are tightly fitted to each other. Specifically when the nozzle receiver rotates while the toner container is being attached to the main body of the image forming apparatus the conveying blades are rotated so that the toner contained in the toner container is conveyed from the rear side to the front side where the nozzle receiver is arranged. Subsequently the scooping ribs receive the toner conveyed by the conveying blades scoop up the toner from bottom to top along with the rotation and introduce the toner into the nozzle hole by using the rib surfaces as slides.

Furthermore similarly to the first embodiment when a user places the toner container according to the second embodiment on the gutter of the container receiving section of the toner container holder and pushes the toner container in the attachment direction Q the toner container moves on the gutter . Along with the movement of the toner container the state of the container front end cover is changed from the first restricted state to the fifth restricted state so that the position of the toner container is restricted in a stepped manner according to each of the states. When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q to change the state from the fifth restricted state to the sixth restricted state a container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section and located in the setting position. And the replenishing device engaging members and are entered into and engaged with the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions . Incidentally in the present embodiment too the shape of the container opening is not limited to the cylindrical shape as long as the container opening is entered into the container setting section so that the radial position is determined as illustrated in . That is the shape of the container opening is not limited to the continuous cylindrical shape but may be divided or may be a rod shape. Therefore the toner container is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction.

As described above by restricting the positional relationship between the toner container and the toner replenishing device in a stepped manner to perform positioning along with the movement of the toner container in the attachment direction Q with respect to the toner replenishing device it becomes possible to stabilize the positions of the centers of the conveying nozzle the container shutter and the receiving opening . Therefore it becomes possible to improve the operability in the attachment operation and prevent toner leakage.

Meanwhile as the scooping portion for improving toner conveying performance to the nozzle hole serving as a powder receiving hole it is also possible to adopt configurations as disclosed in International Publication No. WO2013 183782 International Publication No. WO2013 077474 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13 991 250 which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. The conveying blade serving as the scooping portion may be provided to the nozzle receiver serving as the conveyor receiver or alternatively may be provided so as to extend from the inner wall of the container body toward the inner surface of the container body.

The IC tag employs a contact type communication system. Therefore the connector is arranged at a position on the main body of the toner replenishing device so as to face the front end surface of the container front end cover .

As illustrated in the IC tag is provided with an IC tag opening in which a terminal is set at a position vertically above the gravity center of a substrate in the tag vertical direction. The IC tag opening serves as a positioning opening to determine a position of the IC tag with respect to the image forming apparatus. An earth terminal for grounding earth which is a metal terminal is mounted on the inner surface of the ID tag opening and on the periphery of the ID tag opening . The earth terminal is provided on the front surface of the substrate such that two earth terminal projections extend in the tag horizontal direction relative to the annular portion. One rectangular metallic pad a first metallic pad is arranged above the IC tag opening in the tag vertical direction. Furthermore two metallic pads a second metallic pad and a third metallic pad are arranged below the IC tag opening in the tag vertical direction. A hemispherical protector which is made of a resin material such as epoxy and which covers and protects an information storage unit is provided on the back surface of the substrate .

As illustrated in the holding mechanism holds the IC tag having with the configuration as described above on a vertical surface that is a downstream surface of the container front end cover in the attachment direction. The holding mechanism includes a holder which serves as an IC tag holder and which has a base for holding the IC tag and a holding portion which serves as a cover portion which holds the IC tag and which is detachably attached to the holder . The IC tag and the holding mechanism are arranged in an obliquely upper right space of the container front end cover when viewed from the container front side along the rotation axis of the toner container . Specifically the holding mechanism is arranged on the container front end cover by using the obliquely upper right space that becomes a dead space when the toner container is arranged in tandem with the other toner containers of the other colors. Therefore it becomes possible to provide a compact size toner replenishing device that enables the cylindrical toner containers to be arranged adjacent to one another. Incidentally in the obliquely upper left space of the container front end cover the container gear and the container driving gear of the main body are arranged.

The substrate of the IC tag is sandwiched by the holder of the holding mechanism and the holding portion configured as described above so that the IC tag is held such that the metallic pads to and the earth terminal face the connector .

As illustrated in and the connector includes a positioning pin three apparatus main body terminals and an apparatus main body earth terminal . The three apparatus main body terminals are arranged so as to face the metallic pads to and come into contact with the respective pads to read information from the IC tag when the toner container is moved in the attachment direction Q on the gutter of the toner container holder . The positioning pin is arranged so as to face the IC tag opening used for positioning and is inserted in the IC tag opening when the toner container is being moved and attached to the toner replenishing device in the attachment direction Q. The positions of the IC tag and the connector are determined by insertion of the positioning pin into the IC tag opening . The apparatus main body earth terminal is configured such that the positioning pin comes in contact with the earth terminal inserted in the IC tag opening .

In the present embodiment the positioning pin is inserted in the IC tag opening due to the movement of the toner container in the attachment direction Q between the fifth restricted state and the sixth restricted state as described above.

Specifically before the positioning pin is inserted in the IC tag opening the positions of the toner container in the vertical direction Z and the width direction W are roughly determined in the first restricted state. In the second restricted state the movement of the container front end cover in the radial direction relative to the container cover receiving section is restricted by the contact between the three protrusions and the inner surface of setting cover . Namely in the second restricted state the positions of the toner container in the width direction W the vertical direction Z and the radial direction are determined. Furthermore in the third restricted state the rotation restrictive rib is entered into the groove of the setting cover so that the movement of the container front end cover in a circumferential direction R is restricted. Subsequently in the fourth restricted state the restriction in the radial direction is released. Thereafter in the fifth restricted state the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section so that the position of the container body relative to the toner replenishing device is determined.

Therefore when the positioning pin is inserted in the IC tag opening the restriction in the vertical direction the width direction the circumferential direction and the radial direction is performed so that it is possible to stabilize the relative position of the positioning pin and the IC tag opening . As a result in the present embodiment it becomes possible to improve the operability in the attachment operation prevent toner leakage and prevent a contact failure between the IC tag and the connector .

In a fourth embodiment an explanation will be given of identification mechanism identifier for identifying the compatibility between each of the toner containers and the toner replenishing device.

In general to identify the compatibility identified portions are provided on the respective toner containers and identifying parts are provided on the toner container holder of the toner replenishing device where the identified portions and identifying parts serve as identification mechanism and differ from type to type. If a different type of a toner container is to be attached to the toner container holder the identified portion and the identifying part do not match with each other and are opposed to each other to prevent the toner container from being attached to the toner container holder in order to prevent erroneous attachment.

A predetermined clearance is provided between the toner container and the toner container holder to make the attachment easy. If such a clearance is not provided attachment posture for attaching a correct toner container is severely restricted and attachment of the toner container becomes difficult. In contrast if the clearance is too large while the attachment becomes easier the degree of freedom in the posture of the toner container increases and a certain force may act to allow the toner container to be attached to the toner container holder even when the posture of the toner container is incorrect. Therefore if more than a predetermined amount of load is applied to the toner container to be attached the toner container may be erroneously attached to the toner container holder even with a wrong combination of the identified portion and the identifying part that are not supposed to be attached to each other.

The identification mechanism provided on the toner container holder is arranged on the relatively front side of the image forming apparatus so that the compatibility can be identified at an early stage of the attachment. Therefore the insertion hole part on which the identification mechanism is provided is molded with soft material such as resin in order to prevent a user from being hurt when he she touches this part during the attachment of the toner container. Therefore the identification mechanism provided on the insertion hole part is easily bent so that even when a different type of the toner container is to be attached the toner container may be moved across the identification mechanism and attached to the toner container holder.

If a different type of the toner container is attached as described above it becomes impossible to detach the toner container or the identified portion and the identifying part serving as the identification mechanism may be broken. When in view of the standardization of components the same toner containers are used even for different types and the different types are distinguished by different combinations of the identified portions and the identifying parts. If a wrong toner container is attached to the toner container holder toner of a different color or a different type is conveyed by the toner replenishing device. Therefore certain components such as a developing device or a process cartridge of the image forming apparatus may be damaged.

Therefore in the present embodiment restriction mechanism restrictor is provided to restrict the identified portion of the toner container from moving while passing over the identifying part arranged on the toner container holder. By providing the restriction mechanism even when an incompatible toner container is attached to and forcibly pushed into the toner container holder the identified portion does not pass over the bent identifying part and the toner container is not attached to the wrong toner replenishing device. Therefore it becomes possible to reliably prevent a different type of the toner container from being attached and prevent the identifying part arranged on the toner container holder from being broken.

An incompatibility relationship between the toner container and the toner container holder will be explained in detail below with reference to drawings. is an explanatory perspective view of the front end of the toner container . is a bottom view of the front end of the toner container . In the present embodiment an identified portion is provided on a lower portion of the outer surface of the container front end cover serving as a lower portion of the toner container . The identified portion is arranged between the pair of the sliding guides and serving as a restrictor vertical restrictor located in the width direction W. It is sufficient that the identified portion is located on the lower portion of the outer surface of the container front end cover of the container front end cover and the position is not limited to between the sliding guides and . In the present embodiment the identified portion is a gap in other word an identified gap provided between a pair of identified protrusions and in other words an identified rib protruding from the outer surface of the container front end cover where the identified protrusions and serve as protrusions between the sliding guides and the gap serves as a gap between the protrusions. Alternatively or in addition the identified portion is a gap that is provided in the lower portions of the sliding guides and along the attachment direction so as to be a concave shape where the gap serves as a passage a notch a recess of the sliding guide or a recess of the reinforcing portions. In the present embodiment the gap is provided in the reinforcing portions and serve as parts of the sliding guides and . A width W of the gap presence or absence of the gap and presence or absence of the gap of the sliding guide are set differently depending on a toner color a toner type or an apparatus model. The identified protrusions are arranged on the upstream side in the attachment direction on the rear side of the toner container relative to front ends of the sliding guides and . Furthermore each of the identified protrusions is provided such that an upper part of the identified protrusion is connected to and integrated with the container front end cover and side parts the identified protrusion and of are connected to and integrated with each of the sliding guides and integrated with the container front end cover . Therefore the strength of the components can be increased as compared to a configuration in which only upper portions of the components are integrated with the container front end cover .

In the present embodiment as illustrated in the toner container holder to and from which the toner container is attached and detached includes the container cover receiving section the container receiving section and an insertion hole part A.

The insertion hole part A is provided with the insertion holes Y M C K through which the toner containers for the respective colors passes when the toner containers are attached and detached. The insertion holes have shapes similar to the external shapes of the container front end covers for the respective colors and are provided such that as illustrated in and a certain gap is maintained between the outer surface of container front end cover and the inner surface of each of the insertion holes Y M C K when the toner container is attached and detached.

On an insertion hole base that constitutes a lower part of each of the insertion holes an identifying protrusion in other words a rib an identifying rib which serves as an identifying part and which is to be loosely or tightly fitted to or engaged with the identified portion of the toner container to identify the type of the toner container is provided so as to protrude upward from the insertion hole base . On lower side surfaces and of the insertion holes in the width direction W restriction ribs and Y M C K serving as restriction parts are arranged. The widths and the protrusion amounts of the restriction ribs and Y M C K are set such that the restriction ribs and can be inserted in the sliding grooves and of the sliding guides and see when the toner container for each of the colors is inserted in each of the insertion holes so that the sliding guides and are allowed to slide. Therefore the identified portion provided on the lower portion of each of the container front end covers is fitted to or engaged with each of the identifying protrusions while the sliding grooves receive the respective restriction ribs and the vertical movement of the container front end cover is restricted. At this time because the vertical movement is restricted the toner container is prevented from being lifted up when the identified portion and the identifying protrusion are fitted to or engaged with each other. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion and from being attached in a wrong position.

Incidentally it is preferable to set the lengths of the sliding grooves of the sliding guides in the width direction W the depths of the grooves see such that about two thirds or more of the lengths of the restriction ribs in the width direction W the height of the ribs can be inserted. If the lengths of the centers of the sliding grooves in the width direction W the depths of the grooves see are shorter than two thirds of the lengths of the restriction ribs in the width direction W the heights of the ribs such that the lengths of the groove inclined portions become relatively longer the strength of the sliding guides can be increased but only front ends of the restriction ribs are inserted in the sliding grooves and the restriction in the vertical direction becomes weaker. Therefore the rear end of the toner container is lifted up with respect to the restriction ribs . Consequently even when a wrong toner container is inserted the toner container may erroneously be attached across the identifying protrusion .

As illustrated in the restriction ribs Y M C on each of the insertion holes Y M C in which the toner containers Y M C are inserted are provided so as to protrude in opposite directions from the lower side surfaces and at the same height as the guide rails Y M C provided on the container cover receiving section .

In contrast as illustrated in the restriction ribs K on the insertion hole K in which the toner container K is inserted are provided such that the bottom surfaces are located at the same height as the guide rails K arranged on the container cover receiving section see . Incidentally the lengths of the restriction ribs K in the height direction differ from the lengths of the guide rails K in the height direction such that the lengths of the guide rails K are longer than those of the restriction ribs K . Therefore even when any of the toner containers Y M C that are smaller in size than the toner container K is erroneously inserted in the insertion hole K that is greater in size than the insertion holes Y M C and if the toner container is continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion the guide rails K abut against the sliding guides Y M C of each of the toner containers Y M C so that further insertion can be restricted and erroneous attachment can be prevented. Furthermore the guide rails Y M C K and the restriction ribs Y M C K may be integrated with each other.

While the lengths of the restriction ribs K in the height direction are shorter than the lengths of the sliding grooves in the same direction base ends of the restriction ribs K at the protruding positions on the lower side surfaces and are provided so as to pass by the positions closer to the lower inner surfaces of the sliding grooves than the upper inner surfaces of the sliding grooves when the toner container is inserted. Therefore when the restriction ribs are inserted in the sliding grooves gaps between the bottom surfaces of the restriction ribs and the lower inner surfaces of the sliding grooves are reduced. Therefore even when the toner container is erroneously inserted it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being lifted up and continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion .

Furthermore as another restrictor of the present embodiment the top portion of upward guide arranged on the container front end cover of the toner container is used. As illustrated in the top portion of upward guide comes in contact with a ceiling surface which is an upper surface of the insertion hole part A and which faces the identifying protrusion in the vertical direction so that the vertical movement of the toner container can be restricted. Therefore it becomes possible to further prevent the toner container from being lifted up and from being continuously inserted across the identifying protrusion . Incidentally because the inclined surfaces of upward guide are provided on the upward guide see when the toner container is to be detached from the toner container holder the toner container is moved in the detachment direction through the insertion hole part A along the slopes of the inclined surfaces of upward guide . Therefore the operability in the detachment operation can be improved.

A relationship between the identifying protrusion and the identified portion will be explained below. In the present embodiment in the case of the compatible toner container that is attachable to the insertion hole as illustrated in for example the width W of the gap is set to be wider than a width W of the identifying protrusion of the insertion hole . In the case of the incompatible toner container that is not insertable in the insertion hole as illustrated in the width W of the gap is set to be narrower than the width W of the identifying protrusion of the insertion hole

Therefore when an operator inserts the toner container in the insertion hole the restriction ribs and illustrated in to are first entered into the sliding grooves and of the sliding guides and as illustrated in and . Therefore the vertical movement of the toner container the container front end cover is restricted. At this time the operator cannot move the toner container in the attachment direction Q if the restriction ribs and cannot be entered into the sliding grooves and therefore the toner container can be maintained in a correct posture.

If the toner container is pushed in the attachment direction Q in the restricted state the identified portion approaches the identifying protrusion . At this time if the toner container being attached is the attachable toner container as illustrated in the width W of the gap of the identified portion is wider than the width W of the identifying protrusion . Therefore the movement of the toner container in the attachment direction Q is not restricted and the gap passes by the identifying protrusion so that the container front end cover is moved on the container receiving section and set in the container cover receiving section .

In contrast if the toner container being attached is the unattachable toner container as illustrated in the width W of the gap of the identified portion is narrower than the width W of the identifying protrusion . Therefore the identified protrusions of the identified portion come in contact with the identifying protrusion of the insertion hole . Therefore the movement of the toner container in the attachment direction Q is restricted and the gap cannot pass over the identifying protrusion so that it becomes possible to prevent the unattachable and incompatible toner container from being attached.

Even if the unattachable toner container is forcibly pushed in the attachment direction Q the vertical movement of the toner container the container front end cover is restricted by the sliding grooves and and the restriction ribs and . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the identified portion from passing over the identifying protrusion enabling to more reliably prevent the unattachable and incompatible toner container from being attached.

Furthermore in the present embodiment whether the gap is allowed to pass over the identifying protrusion is controlled according to the width W of the gap of the toner container and the presence or absence of the gap of the sliding guide. Namely the compatibility and the incompatibility can be determined by adjusting the width W or determining the presence or absence of the gap of the sliding guide according to the position or the numbers of the identifying protrusions . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent a wrong toner container from being attached to the toner replenishing device the toner container holder by a simple structure without negative influence on the operability.

As illustrated in the gap of the identified portion with the narrower width W cannot pass over an identifying part including the two identifying protrusions unattachable .

As illustrated in the gap of the identified portion with the narrower width W can pass over the identifying protrusion including the single identifying protrusion attachable .

As illustrated in the gap of the identified portion with the wider width W can pass over the identifying protrusion regardless of whether the number of the identifying protrusions is one or two attachable .

The configurations and dimensions of the identified portion and the identifying protrusion will be explained in detail below with reference to to . Incidentally in the following different reference numerals will be assigned to the gap and the gap of the sliding guide in different examples. to are diagrams illustrating the configurations of the gap provided on the container front end cover . and illustrate a first example in which a gap with a width of 3 mm is provided between identified protrusions and which serve as a pair of identified portions or protrusions between the sliding guides and which are arranged on the lower portion of the container front end cover .

In and the gap or the gap is provided on the single sliding guide located on the right side or the left side in the attachment direction Q. However the configurations of the gaps and of the sliding guides are not limited to these examples.

For example as illustrated in it may be possible to provide the gaps each having a width of 3 mm from the offset position shifted by 9 mm from the center of the lower portion of the container front end cover on the respective sliding guides and in the attachment direction Q on the right and left sides in the attachment direction Q. Furthermore the identified protrusion or the identified protrusion may be provided between the sliding guides and as illustrated in or or may not be provided between the sliding guides and as illustrated in .

A fifth embodiment of the identified portion will be explained below with reference to to . The fifth embodiment is the same as the fourth embodiment in terms of the width W of the gap and the presence or absence of the gap of sliding guide but differs from the fourth embodiment in terms of the configuration of the identified portion when viewed from the bottom side. Therefore to illustrate the bottom views of the identified portion according to the fifth embodiment and the front view and the back view are omitted.

In and denote protrusions between sliding guides serving as identified protrusions and denotes a gap which serves as an identified gap or a gap between the protrusions provided between the protrusions and

In denotes a gap which is a passage a notch or a recess of the sliding guide in the attachment direction Q on the left side in the attachment direction Q and denotes a protrusion between sliding guides serving as an identified protrusion.

In the fifth embodiment illustrated in to as compared to the fourth embodiment each of the protrusions between sliding guides and is extended to a position on the downstream side near the front end of the toner container in the attachment direction relative to the centers of the sliding guides and in the longitudinal direction. Specifically each of the protrusions between sliding guides and is arranged such that one end thereof is located near the front ends of sliding guides and . Because the end of each of the protrusions between sliding guides and is located near the front ends of sliding guides when a wrong toner container is attached a wall surface of each of the protrusions between sliding guides and on the downstream side in the attachment direction is fitted to the identifying protrusion immediately after the toner container is entered into the insertion hole of the insertion hole part . If contrary to the present embodiment the identified protrusion is provided on a container rear side of the sliding guides so as to be located distant from the front ends between sliding guides the identified portion comes in contact with the identifying protrusion after the front ends between sliding guides are entered into the gutter across the insertion hole base . As described above the insertion hole part is likely to be touched by an operator and is therefore made of a material that is softer and more flexible than those of the container receiving section and the gutter arranged on the rear side relative to the insertion hole part in the attachment direction. Therefore if the toner container is pushed in the attachment direction while the rear side of the toner container is being moved in the vertical direction the contact portion between the front ends of sliding guides and the gutter that is hard to bend acts as a fulcrum to cause the insertion hole base or the identifying protrusion protruding from the insertion hole base to bend. If the identifying protrusion is bent the identified portion can easily pass over the identifying protrusion so that the toner container may be attached in a wrong position.

In contrast according to the present embodiment as illustrated in each of the protrusions between sliding guides identified portions and comes in contact with the identifying protrusion when the front ends of sliding guides are located on the insertion hole base before being entered into the gutter . Therefore even when the toner container is pushed in the attachment direction while the rear end of the toner container is being moved in the vertical direction during the attachment operation of the toner container because the contact position between the front ends of sliding guides and the insertion hole base acts as a fulcrum the identifying protrusions is bent in accordance with the vertical movement of the toner container . Therefore each of the protrusions between sliding guides and can hardly pass over the identifying protrusion so that it becomes possible to reliably prevent the toner container from being attached in a wrong position.

Furthermore according to the present embodiment in the state illustrated in each of the protrusions between sliding guides and comes in contact with the identifying protrusion at a position at which the fronts of sliding groove each having a narrow clearance gap between the upper surface and the lower surface thereof of the sliding guides sandwich the respective restriction ribs as illustrated in .

Therefore each of the protrusions between the sliding guides and and the identifying protrusion come in contact with each other while the vertical restriction by the sliding guides and the restriction ribs is intensified. Therefore each of the protrusions between the sliding guides and and the identifying protrusion come in contact with each other while the vertical movement of the toner container is restricted so that it becomes possible to reliably prevent each of the protrusions between sliding guides and from passing over the identifying protrusions and prevent the toner container from being attached in a wrong position.

As described above by setting the locations of the identifying protrusion and setting the locations the dimensions and the presence or absence of each of the protrusion between the sliding guides the gap between the protrusions and the gap of the sliding guide according to toner colors toner components and apparatus models as well as by restricting the vertical movement by the sliding guides and and the restriction ribs it becomes possible to increase variations of the incompatibility relationships between the toner container and the toner container holder while ensuring good operability rather than the incompatibility relationships based on simple engagement disengagement of protrusions. Therefore it becomes possible to more reliably prevent an unattachable toner container from being attached.

The configurations of the identifying protrusion the identified portion and the restriction ribs are not applied to only the first embodiment but applied to the relationship between the container front end cover of the toner container and the insertion hole in the second and the third embodiments. Even in these cases the same advantageous effects as those of the present embodiment can be obtained.

In a sixth embodiment another example of the radial restrictor of the toner container with respect to the toner replenishing device as described in the first to the fifth embodiments will be explained.

As illustrated in setting cover protrusions protruding inward from the inner surface of setting cover are provided at three evenly spaced positions in the circumferential direction on the setting cover . When the container front end cover is entered into the container cover receiving section the outer surface of the container front end cover comes in contact with the setting cover protrusions so that the movement of the toner container is guided and the radial position is determined. The container front end cover includes recesses that can face the setting cover protrusions . When the toner container is pushed to a predetermined position in the attachment direction Q in the toner replenishing device the recesses are located opposite the setting cover protrusions . Accordingly the radial restriction of the container front end cover by the outer surface of the container front end cover and the setting cover protrusions is released.

While the toner container is explained as an example in the sixth embodiment the present embodiment may be applied to the toner container of the second embodiment as illustrated in in which a spiral groove is not provided on the outer surface of the container body and the conveyor having the scooping function is provided inside the container body.

In a seventh embodiment another example of the circumferential restrictor of the toner container with respect to the toner replenishing device will be explained.

As illustrated in the container front end cover is provided with a circumferential restricting groove serving as a circumferential restrictor on the outer surface thereof. The circumferential restricting groove is provided inward from the outer surface of container front end cover . Hereinafter the circumferential restricting groove is referred to as a rotation restrictive concave serving as a guiding portion or a circumferential positioner. The rotation restrictive concave is arranged so as to be entered into a convex which serves as a convex of a main body side and which is provided on the setting cover illustrated in when the toner container is attached to the toner replenishing device .

In the following the order of restriction and release of all of the positioners of the sixth and seventh embodiments with respect to the toner replenishing device will be explained with reference to and . The order is basically the same as the order as illustrated in and to E except that the configurations of the setting cover protrusions the rotation restrictive concave and the convex of the setting cover are different. Therefore in the following the explanation will be simplified appropriately.

As illustrated in when a user places the toner container on the gutter of the container receiving section of the toner container holder and pushes the toner container in the attachment direction Q performs attachment operation the toner container slides on the gutter . At this time as illustrated in the toner container slides while the side portions of upward guide of the toner container come in contact with the projections provided from the ceiling surface facing the gutter . Therefore the toner container can be pushed in the attachment direction Q while the movement of the toner container in the vertical direction Z is restricted. Furthermore the movement in the vertical direction is restricted not by the top portion of upward guide on the top of the upward guide but by the side portions of upward guide provided on the both sides of the top portion of upward guide . Therefore even when the toner container is deviated in the horizontal direction during the pushing operation the toner container can reliably brought into contact with the ceiling surface side.

On the toner replenishing device side as illustrated in the fronts of sliding grooves serving as the first guides are entered into the most upstream side of the respective guide rails and in the attachment direction Q. Therefore the positions in the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and in the vertical direction Z are roughly determined a first restricted state .

When the toner container in the first restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q as illustrated in the end surface of container shutter and the front end of conveying nozzle come in contact with each other. When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a second restricted state as illustrated in is obtained in which the front end of the container front end cover is entered into the container cover receiving section . Due to the entrance of the front end of the container front end cover into the container cover receiving section the outer surface of container cover comes in contact with from the inner side the setting cover protrusions provided on the inner surface of setting cover . Due to the contact between the outer surface of container cover and the setting cover protrusions of the inner surface of setting cover the movement of the toner container is guided and the radial movement is restricted.

When the toner container in the second restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the container seal and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in . When the toner container in this state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a third restricted state as illustrated in is obtained. In the third restricted state the fronts of sliding grooves come off from the guide rails and the vertical direction Z is restricted by the centers of sliding grooves serving as second guides as illustrated in . Furthermore the rotation restrictive concave provided on the outer surface of container cover of the front end of the container front end cover is entered into the convex provided on the setting cover . Therefore the container front end cover and the setting cover the container cover receiving section are integrated and the movement of the container front end cover in the circumferential direction R is restricted so that the container front end cover does not rotate with the rotation of the container body .

When the toner container in the third restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a fourth restricted state as illustrated in is obtained in which the recesses provided on the container front end cover are located opposite the setting cover protrusions . Therefore the radial restriction of the container front end cover by the outer surface of the container front end cover and the setting cover protrusions is released.

When the toner container in the fourth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a fifth restricted state as illustrated in is obtained in which the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section the setting cover and the container body is rotatably supported inside the inner surface of container setting section . At this time the circumferential position of the container front end cover is restricted by the rotation restrictive concave and the convex of setting cover so that the container opening and the container setting section can mate with each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section in a deviated manner. Furthermore when the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section the radial restriction by the outer surface of container cover and the setting cover protrusions is already released so that the circumferential restriction by the rotation restrictive concave is not interfered.

When the toner container in the fifth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a sixth restricted state as illustrated in is obtained. In the sixth restricted state the container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section and the replenishing device engaging members and are entered into and fitted to the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions and see . Therefore the toner container is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction the rotation axis direction and is maintained in the setting position.

As described above if the rotation restrictive portion of the container front end cover has a convex shape with respect to the outer surface of container cover and if impact or a force is applied to the convex portion because of dropping or the like stress is concentrated and the rotation restrictive portion may be damaged. However as in the present embodiment if the rotation restrictive portion is provided as the rotation restrictive concave that has a concave shape with respect to the outer surface of the container front end cover the rotation restrictive portion does not come in contact with a floor at the time of dropping for example. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the rotation restrictive portion from being damaged.

In an eighth embodiment the configuration of a cover portion of a toner container serving as a powder container differs from the configuration of the container front end cover serving as the cover portion as described above and the configuration of a container holding section to which the toner container is attached differs from the configuration of the toner container holder serving as the container holding section as described above. Furthermore the configuration of identification mechanism for identifying the compatibility between the toner container and the toner container holder the toner replenishing device differs from the configuration of the identification mechanism as described above. Therefore in the eighth embodiment the configurations of the cover portion the container holding section and the identification mechanism will be mainly explained. The container body or and the other components having the same configurations as those described above will be denoted by the same reference numerals and the same explanation will be omitted appropriately.

As illustrated in and a toner container serving as a powder container according to the present embodiment includes the container body for storing toner as a powder for image formation and a container front end cover serving as a container cover attached to the outer surface of the container body . The container body is rotatably held by the container front end cover .

The container front end cover is provided in a cylindrical shape such that one end is opened and the container opening of the container body protrudes from a front end of container cover in the attachment direction. A gear exposing opening is arranged on an outer surface of container front end cover so that a part of the container gear of the container body can be exposed when the container front end cover is attached to the container body .

Cover hooks which are engaged with the cover hook stoppers of the container body are arranged at three positions in the circumferential direction on the front end of container front end cover in the attachment direction. Therefore the container body and the container front end cover can rotate relative to each other.

Container engaged portions and are provided on the outer surface of container front end cover to determine the position of the toner container relative to a toner container holder the toner replenishing device illustrated in to in the axial direction. The replenishing device engaging members and are engaged with the respective container engaged portions and when the toner container is attached to the toner container holder the toner replenishing device .

The function and the configuration of each of the container engaged portions and are the same as those of the container engaged portions explained above with reference to and . Specifically as illustrated in each of the container engaged portions includes a guiding protrusion a guiding groove a bump and an engaged opening serving as a guiding portion an axial restrictor an axial regulator an axial positioner or an axial guide. Two sets of the container engaged portions are arranged on left and right sides of the container front end cover respectively where one set of the container engaged portion includes the guiding protrusion the guiding groove the bump and the engaged opening as described above. Incidentally the container engaged portions differ from the container engaged portions in that the container engaged portions and are arranged on the container front end cover so as to face each other and be inclined with respect to the horizontal line passing through the center of the container opening while the container engaged portions and are located in approximately horizontal direction on the container front end cover . Specifically the engaged openings and are arranged on left and right sides across the center of the container opening such that one of the engaged openings is located above the gear exposing opening and the other one of the engaged openings is located below the gear exposing opening . Each of the guiding protrusions is arranged on the container front end of the container front end cover so as to be located on a vertical plane perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container and on an inclined line passing through the rotation axis of the container body . Each of the guiding protrusions includes an inclined surface connected to each of the guiding grooves so as to come in contact with the replenishing device engaging members and guide the replenishing device engaging members to the guiding grooves when the toner container is attached. Each of the guiding grooves is a groove recessed from the side surface of the container front end cover .

The width of each of the guiding grooves is set to be slightly wider than the width of each of the replenishing device engaging members such that the replenishing device engaging members do not come off from the guiding grooves . The container rear ends of the guiding grooves are not directly connected to the respective engaged openings but are terminated and are located at the same height as the side surfaces of the container front end cover . Namely the outer surface of container front end cover with a width of about 1 mm is exposed between each of the guiding grooves and each of the quadrangular the engaged openings and this portion serves as the bump . The replenishing device engaging members pass over the bumps and fall in the engaged openings so that the toner container and the toner container holder the toner replenishing device are engaged with each other. This state is the setting position setting state of the toner container .

As illustrated in the container shutter is located in the center of a segment connecting the two container engaged portions on a virtual plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. If the container shutter is not located on the segment connecting the two container engaged portions the following situations may occur. Specifically due to the biasing forces of the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container about the segment where the moment arm is a distance from the segment to the container shutter . Due to the action of the moment of force the toner container may be inclined with respect to the toner container holder the toner replenishing device . In this case an attachment load on the toner container increases so that a load is applied to the nozzle receiver that holds and guides the container shutter . In particular if the toner container is new and adequately filled with toner and when the toner container is pushed from the rear side so as to insert the conveying nozzle protruding in the horizontal direction a moment of force acts to rotate the toner container with the weight of toner added. Therefore a load is applied to the nozzle receiver in which the conveying nozzle is inserted and the nozzle receiver may be deformed or broken in the worst case. In contrast in the toner container according to the present embodiment the container shutter is located on the segment connecting the two container engaged portions . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being inclined with respect to the toner container holder the toner replenishing device due to the biasing forces of the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring that act at the position of the container shutter .

As illustrated in and an IC tag and a holder are provided on the container front end cover where the IC tag serves as an IC chip an information storage medium or an information storage device of the toner container and the holder serves as an IC tag holder for the IC tag . The IC tag employs a contact type communication system.

As illustrated in and in the IC tag multiple rectangular metallic pads metallic plates such as a first metallic pad to a fourth metallic pad are arranged side by side on the surface of a rectangular substrate . The fourth metallic pad is an earth terminal for grounding earth . An information storage unit is provided on the back surface of the substrate .

The IC tag as described above is held on the container front end cover by the holder such that the first metallic pad to the fourth metallic pad are located on the downstream side in the attachment direction. The holder is arranged on the container front end cover so as to protrude in the attachment direction Q relative to a vertical surface

In the present embodiment the holder functions as a circumferential restrictor of the toner container and is therefore integrally molded with the container front end cover so that the relative position with respect to the container front end cover can be managed easily. However as long as the relative position of the holder and the container front end cover can be managed the holder may be provided separately from the container front end cover and may be integrally mounted on the container front end cover by connecting means such as bonding welding or joining. In this case it becomes possible to simplify the shape of the container front end cover so that processing costs can be reduced.

The holder is arranged in an approximately middle position between the container engaged portions and facing each other on the container front end cover so as to be approximately parallel to the inclined segment connecting the container engaged portions and . Therefore the gear exposing opening is provided in an approximately horizontal position that is different from the position of the gear exposing opening provided on the container front end cover . Both side surfaces and which serve as guiding portions both surfaces of the holder circumferential restrictor circumferential regulators circumferential positioners or circumferential guides for restricting movement of the container front end cover in the vertical direction and which are located in the longitudinal direction of the holder .

The holder is arranged in an obliquely upper left space of the container front end cover when viewed from the container front side along the rotation axis of the toner container . Specifically the holder is arranged on the container front end cover by using the obliquely upper left space that becomes a dead space when the toner container is arranged in tandem with the other toner containers of the other colors. Therefore it becomes possible to provide the compact size toner replenishing device that enables the cylindrical toner containers to be arranged adjacent to one another.

As mainly illustrated in the container front end cover includes a guiding portion that guides the container opening to the container setting section as illustrated in and by restricting the toner container being attached from moving in directions other than the attachment direction when the toner container is attached to the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus .

As illustrated in and a pair of sliding guides and are provided on both side surfaces of a lower portion of the container front end cover where the sliding guides and serve as a pair of guiding portions vertical restrictors vertical regulators vertical positioners or vertical guides for restricting movement of the container front end cover in the vertical direction and the lower portion serves a lower portion of the outer surface of the container front end cover. Each of the sliding guides and includes an upper surface A serving as an upper guide and a lower surface B serving as a lower guide each extending along the longitudinal direction of the container body . Sliding grooves and are provided between the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B respectively. Each of the sliding grooves is provided parallel to the rotation axis of the container body such that each of guide rails and as a pair as illustrated in can be sandwiched in the vertical direction.

Specifically the upper surfaces A and the lower surfaces B sandwich the respective guide rails in the vertical direction so that the sliding guides and function as positioners of the container front end cover in the vertical direction Z and the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment detachment direction when the toner container is attached to the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus to thereby restrict the movement of the toner container in the vertical direction Z and the width direction W.

Namely the container front end cover includes as the guiding portions for guiding the container opening to a container cover receiving section when the toner container is attached to the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus the pair of the sliding guides and serving as vertical restrictors the both side surfaces and of the holder serving as circumferential restrictors and the container engaged portions with the engaged openings serving as axial restrictors.

The configuration of the toner container holder the toner replenishing device will be explained below with reference to and .

The toner container holder to which the toner container is attached is arranged in the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus in place of the toner container holder illustrated in . In the present embodiment the toner container holder to which the single toner container is attached will be described. Specifically a monochrome image forming apparatus includes the single toner container holder in the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus and a multicolor image forming apparatus includes the same number of the toner container holders as the number of colors in the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus . The toner container set in the toner container holder supplies at a replenishing timing toner to a developing device corresponding to the color of the toner contained in the toner container.

In the present embodiment the toner replenishing device includes the toner container holder the conveying nozzle serving as a conveyor the conveying screw serving as an apparatus main body conveyor arranged inside the conveying nozzle a container rotating part serving as a driving part and a toner dropping passage. When a user performs attachment operation to push the toner container in the attachment direction Q and the toner container is moved inside the toner container holder of the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus the conveying nozzle of the toner replenishing device is inserted from a front side of the toner container in the attachment direction Q along with the attachment operation. Therefore the toner container and the conveying nozzle communicate with each other.

The toner container holder mainly includes the container cover receiving section a container receiving section and an insertion hole part illustrated in . The container cover receiving section is a section for holding the container front end cover and the container body of the toner container . The container receiving section is a section for holding the container body of the toner container . The insertion hole part is provided with an insertion hole serving as an insertion opening used in the attachment operation of the toner container as illustrated in . When a main body cover arranged on the front side of the copier the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of is opened the insertion hole part of the toner container holder is exposed. Then attachment detachment operation of the toner container attachment detachment operation with the longitudinal direction of the toner containers taken as an attachment detachment direction is performed from the front side of the copier while the toner container is oriented with its longitudinal direction being parallel to the horizontal direction. Incidentally a setting cover is a part of the container cover receiving section of the toner container holder .

The container receiving section is provided such that its longitudinal length becomes approximately the same as the longitudinal length of the container body Y. The container cover receiving section is arranged on a container front side of the container receiving section in the longitudinal direction attachment detachment direction and the insertion hole part is arranged on one end of the container receiving section in the longitudinal direction. The toner container is able to move on the container receiving section in a sliding manner. Therefore along with the attachment operation of the toner container the container front end cover first passes through the insertion hole part slides on the container receiving section for a while and is finally attached to the container cover receiving section .

As illustrated in while the container front end cover is attached to the container cover receiving section the container rotating part including the driving motor and multiple gears inputs rotation drive to the container gear provided in the container body via the container driving gear serving as an apparatus main body gear. Therefore the container body is rotated in the arrow A direction in . With the rotation of the container body the spiral groove provided with a spiral shape on the inner surface of the container body conveys toner stored in the container body along the longitudinal direction of the container body . The conveyed toner is supplied from the container front end cover side which is on the other end of the toner container to the inside of the conveying nozzle via the nozzle hole serving as a powder receiving hole provided on the conveying nozzle . Subsequently the conveying screw arranged inside the conveying nozzle rotates when the rotation drive is input to the conveyor screw gear of the container rotating part serving as a driving part so that the toner supplied in the conveying nozzle is conveyed. Then the toner is replenished to the developing device the second developer accommodating section via the toner dropping passage connected to the downstream end of the conveying nozzle in the conveying direction.

The toner container is replaced with a new one at the end of its lifetime when the container becomes empty because almost all of the contained toner is consumed . When the toner container is to be replaced an operator can grip the gripper which is arranged on one end of the toner container opposite the container front end cover in the longitudinal direction to pull out and detach the attached toner container .

The configuration of the container rotating part will be explained below. The container rotating part includes similarly to the container rotating part Y the container driving gear and the conveyor screw gear . As illustrated in and when the driving motor fixed to the mounting frame is driven and the output gear is rotated the conveyor screw gear rotates see . The container driving gear rotates by receiving the rotation of the output gear from the conveyor screw gear via the multiple coupled gears .

As illustrated in and the setting cover is arranged on the container cover receiving section . The conveying nozzle is arranged in the center of the setting cover . As illustrated in the conveying nozzle is arranged so as to protrude from the end surface of container setting section on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container toward the upstream side in the attachment direction inside the container cover receiving section . The container setting section serving as the container receiving section stands in the protruding direction of the conveying nozzle that is toward the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container so as to surround the conveying nozzle . Specifically the container setting section is arranged at the base of the conveying nozzle and serves as a positioner to determine the position of the container opening . When the container opening is inserted in and mated to the container setting section the radial position of the container opening is determined.

As illustrated in at the base of the conveying nozzle located on the downstream side in the attachment direction when viewed from the attachment direction the container setting section is provided to which the container opening is fitted when the toner container is attached to the toner container holder . The container setting section is located at the base of the conveying nozzle and includes the end surface of container setting section on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container relative to the inner surface of container setting section in which the container opening is inserted. On the end surface of container setting section the spring fixing parts protruding from the end surface of container setting section to the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container are provided at eight evenly spaced positions along the outer periphery of the nozzle shutter spring . By placing the spring fixing parts so as to cover the outer periphery of the nozzle shutter spring it becomes possible to restrict the radial movement of the nozzle shutter spring . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent the toner container from being set while the nozzle shutter spring is deviated in the radial direction and prevent the nozzle shutter spring from being caught between the end surface of container setting section and the front end of the container opening enabling to prevent a failure to attach the toner container to the toner replenishing device .

When the toner container is attached to the toner container holder the outer surface of container opening of the toner container slidably mates with the inner surface of container setting section

By the mating the inner surface of the container setting section and the outer surface of container opening of the toner container to each other the position of the toner container relative to the toner container holder in the radial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the toner container is determined. Furthermore when the toner container rotates the outer surface of container opening functions as a rotational shaft and the inner surface of container setting section functions as a bearing. At this time the outer surface of container opening comes in sliding contact with the contact surfaces as parts of the inner surface of container setting section and the radial position of the toner container relative to the toner container holder is determined.

As illustrated in the setting cover is provided with holes and so as to face each other in the width direction W and allow the replenishing device engaging members and to move back and forth from the outer surface of the setting cover to an inner surface of setting cover side. The holes and are inclined with respect to the horizontal direction so as to face the container engaged portions and when the toner container is attached. The replenishing device engaging members and are biased from the outer side to the inner side of the setting cover by biasing means such as the torsion coil springs .

The setting cover includes a connector which serves as a reading means for reading information from the IC tag by coming into contact with the IC tag when the toner container is attached and includes a guiding part for housing the connector . The guiding part is a rectangular space that is arranged so as to protrude in the radial direction from the surface of the setting cover and that extends in the insertion direction from the side opposite the front surface of the container front end cover . The size of the guiding part is set so that the guiding part can house the connector and the holder of the IC tag . The guiding part serves as a circumferential restrictor.

As illustrated in the connector includes four apparatus main body terminals a first apparatus main body terminal to a fourth apparatus main body terminal that can come in contact with the first metallic pad to the fourth metallic pad respectively. Incidentally the fourth apparatus main body terminal serves as an earth terminal of the main body that can come in contact with the fourth metallic pad serving as an earth terminal. The connector is arranged on the inner rear side of the guiding part on the downstream side in the attachment direction Q. The connector comes in contact with the pads of the IC tag and reads information from the IC tag when the toner container is moved in the attachment direction Q on a gutter serving as a container mounting section of the toner container holder .

As illustrated in on inner surfaces of wall and serving as an inner surface that protrude from the surface of the setting cover the container cover receiving section and that are located in the radial direction indicated by an arrow R positioners and are provided so as to protrude from the inner surfaces of wall and to the inside of a space. The positioners and are provided on the inner surfaces of wall and so as to extend in the attachment direction Q such that one ends of positioners and are located on the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container and other ends of positioners and are located on the downstream side in the attachment direction. The positioners and may be integrated with the inner surfaces of wall and or may be provided as separate bodies and integrally mounted on the inner surfaces of wall and by bonding welding or the like. When the IC tag is entered into the guiding part at the time of attachment of the toner container the both side surfaces and of the holder come in contact with the positioners and as described above. In the present embodiment the positioners and are provide such that a space between the positioners and is reduced along the attachment direction Q. Therefore as the toner container is moved further in the attachment direction Q the both side surfaces and of the holder and the positioners and are more tightly connected so that the circumferential movement of the holder between the positioners and is further restricted. Specifically portions from the one ends of positioners and to centers of positioners and are provided as flat inclined surfaces such that the space between the positioners and is reduced and the other ends of positioners and are provided with semicircular shapes and located parallel to each other. A width W between the one ends of positioners and is wider than a width W between the both side surfaces and of the holder see . A width W between the other ends of positioners and is set to be the same as or slightly narrower than the width W between the both side surfaces and of the holder .

As illustrated in the container receiving section is provided with the gutter serving as a container mounting section extending from the insertion hole part to the container cover receiving section along the longitudinal direction of the container body . The toner container is able to move on the gutter in a sliding manner in the longitudinal direction the attachment detachment direction .

On side surfaces of gutter and which are opposite surfaces arranged in the width direction W guide rails and serving as guiding parts are arranged so as to face each other. The guide rails protrude in the width direction W from the side surfaces of gutter and extend in the longitudinal direction and are arranged from one end of container receiving section to the front of the container cover receiving section . The guide rails and have functions to guide the container opening to the container setting section serving as a container receiving section by being fitted to the sliding guides serving as guiding portions when the toner container is attached to the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus .

Incidentally each of the guide rails is divided into four sections in the longitudinal direction in the present embodiment however each of the guide rails may be a single continuous rail in the longitudinal direction. The guide rails are provided so as to be parallel to the rotation axis of the container body when the toner container is attached to the toner container holder .

The identification mechanism of the present embodiment enable to identify a combination of the toner container and the toner container holder according to toner colors toner types print speed or apparatus models.

As illustrated in and an identified portion constituting the identification mechanism for identifying the compatibility is provided between the sliding guides and on the lower portion of the outer surface of container front end cover . A reinforcing portion is integrally provided between the sliding guides and in an integrally connected manner. The reinforcing portion is provided along the whole length of the sliding guides and in the attachment detachment direction to prevent the sliding guides from being damaged when the toner container is dropped. The identified portion is provided on the sliding guide. Specifically the identified portion is provided on the reinforcing portion . In the present embodiment the identified portion is provided as grooves extending in the attachment detachment direction.

As illustrated in in a position located on the downstream side in the attachment direction Q relative to the insertion hole on the gutter two identifying protrusions are provided so as to protrude upward from the gutter where the identifying protrusions serve as identifying parts constituting the identification mechanism and are to come in contact with the identified portion of the toner container and the gutter serves as the container mounting section of the container receiving section . In the present embodiment the identifying protrusions are provided as two protrusions. However the widths the heights the positions and the number of the identifying protrusions are changed depending on the widths the heights the positions and the number of the grooves of the identified portion to distinguish the combinations of the toner container and the toner container holder from one another.

The identifying protrusions are located on the downstream side in the attachment direction Q relative to front edges of guide rails and on the one end of the container receiving section such that the identifying protrusions can come in contact with the identified portion after the guide rails and are inserted in the sliding grooves and . The arrangement of the identifying protrusions is not limited to the example illustrated in . The identifying protrusions may be located on the further downstream position than the position in in the attachment direction Q or may be located on the insertion hole side. However it is preferable to locate the identifying protrusions such that they come in contact with the identified portion after the guide rails and are inserted in the sliding grooves and

With this configuration when a wrong toner container is attached the identifying protrusions come in contact with the identified portion of the toner container after the guide rails and the sliding guides are adequately fitted to each other. Therefore the identified portion and the identifying protrusions come in contact with each other after the position of the toner container in the up down direction vertical direction is determined in the attachment operation. As a result it becomes possible to stably and more accurately bring the identified portion and the identifying protrusions into contact with each other.

The order of restriction and release of all of the positioners of the eighth embodiment with respect to the toner container holder the toner replenishing device will be explained below with reference to and so on.

As illustrated in when a user places the toner container on the gutter of the container receiving section of the toner container holder and pushes the toner container in the attachment direction Q performs attachment operation the toner container slides on the gutter . Subsequently the guide rails and are respectively entered into the sliding grooves of the sliding guides of the toner container so that the positions in the width direction W perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and in the vertical direction Z are roughly determined the first restricted state .

When the toner container in the first restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q and if the toner container being attached is a wrong toner container the identified portion comes in contact with the identifying protrusions as illustrated in and . In this case if the shapes or positions of the identified portion and the identifying protrusions do not match with each other the movement of the toner container in the attachment direction Q is prevented so that it becomes possible to prevent attachment of a different type of the toner container . Furthermore the first restricted state is maintained at this time therefore even if a different type of the toner container is forcibly pushed it is possible to prevent the identified portion from passing over the identifying protrusions because the position in the vertical direction Z is roughly determined. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent attachment of a different type of the toner container .

If the shapes of the identified portion and the identifying protrusions match with each other and the identifying protrusions allow the identified portion to move the toner container is further moved in the attachment direction Q. Therefore as illustrated in the end surface of the container shutter and the front end of the conveying nozzle come in contact with each other.

When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a second restricted state as illustrated in is obtained in which the holder located in the attachment direction Q relative to the vertical surface of the container front end cover is entered into the guiding part that includes the connector . At this time because the position in the vertical direction Z is roughly determined by the sliding grooves of the sliding guides the holder is entered into the guiding part while its position in the vertical direction Z is roughly determined. The entered state is illustrated in detail in and . Therefore the movement of the side surfaces and of the holder in the circumferential direction R is roughly determined by inner surfaces of wall and of the guiding part .

When the toner container in the second restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the container seal and the nozzle shutter flange come in contact with each other as illustrated in and the holder is further moved inside the guiding part as illustrated in . This state is illustrated in . At this time the side surfaces and of the holder move on the flat surfaces tapered from the one ends of positioners and arranged on the inner surfaces of guiding part and toward the centers of positioners and respectively so that the side surfaces and move in the attachment direction Q while their movement in the radial direction R is gradually restricted.

When the toner container is further moved in the attachment direction as illustrated in and the side surfaces and of the holder are located between the other ends of positioners and where the width is narrowest a third restricted state . Specifically in the third restricted state the movement in the radial direction R is completely restricted by the holder and the guiding part while the restriction in the vertical direction Z by the sliding grooves and the guide rails is maintained. Therefore the container front end cover and the setting cover the container cover receiving section are integrated and the container front end cover is restricted from moving in the circumferential direction R and is prevented from rotating with the rotation of the container body .

When the toner container in the third restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a fourth restricted state as illustrated in is obtained in which the container opening is entered into the inner surface of container setting section the setting cover and the container body is rotatably supported inside the inner surface of container setting section . At this time the position of the container front end cover in the circumferential direction R is restricted by the holder and the guiding part so that the container opening and the container setting section can mate with each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section in a deviated manner. Furthermore in this state each of the pads of the IC tag comes in contact with a corresponding one of the apparatus main body terminals of the connector and information is read from the IC tag . Namely when the IC tag and the connector come in contact with each other the positions in the vertical direction Z and the radial direction R are determined therefore a contact failure is less likely to occur and communication can be performed stably.

When the toner container in the fourth restricted state is further pushed in the attachment direction Q a fifth restricted state as illustrated in is obtained. In the fifth restricted state the container opening is entered further into the inner surface of container setting section and the replenishing device engaging members and are entered into and engaged with the respective engaged openings of the container engaged portions and see . Therefore the toner container is prevented from moving in the longitudinal direction the rotation axis direction and is maintained in the setting position. While the engaged openings are illustrated in the dimensions and the configurations of the engaged openings and the engaged openings are the same with each other therefore the states of the engaged openings are the same as those of the engaged openings

As described above if the rotation of the container front end cover is restricted by the fitting between the guiding part housing the connector and the holder holding the IC tag on the outer surface of container cover the container opening and the container setting section can be fitted to each other such that the respective centers coincide with each other. Therefore it becomes possible to prevent toner leakage from the container shutter due to insertion of the container opening into the container setting section in a deviated manner. Furthermore the positioning of the IC tag is not needed and rough positioning is satisfactory.

As in the present embodiment if the IC tag is arranged in an approximately middle position between the pair of the container engaged portions and engaged with the replenishing device engaging members and on the outer surface of container front end cover the following advantageous effects can be obtained. Specifically as for the movement of the IC tag the movement in the radial direction is acceptable but the movement in the circumferential direction R is not preferable because the circumferential movement may cause a contact failure. If the IC tag is arranged in the approximately middle position between the pair of the replenishing device engaging members and a force is equally applied from the both sides in the circumferential direction R so that the movement in the circumferential direction R can be prevented and a contact failure between the IC tag and the connector can be prevented which is a preferable configuration.

Furthermore in the present embodiment the replenishing device engaging members and and the container engaged portions and are inclined with respect to the horizontal direction. Therefore it becomes possible to reduce the protrusion amount of the container front end cover in the horizontal direction from the outer surface of container cover as compared to a configuration in which the replenishing device engaging members and and the container engaged portions and are arranged in the horizontal direction. Consequently it becomes possible to save a space of the container holding section for each of the colors. As a result it becomes possible to effectively use the space of the printer the main body of the image forming apparatus enabling to reduce the size of the image forming apparatus. Furthermore if multiple toner containers are attached as in a color image forming apparatus it becomes possible to reduce a mounting space in the horizontal direction enabling to further reduce the size of the image forming apparatus.

Moreover according to the present embodiment the identified portion is provided which is provide on the lower portion of the container front end cover in the lower portion of the toner container and which can pass over the identifying protrusions . Furthermore the pair of the sliding guides and are provided which serve as vertical restrictors for restricting the movement of the toner container in the vertical direction Z by receiving the pair of the guide rails and when the identified portion passes through the insertion hole . Therefore it becomes possible to reliably prevent attachment of a wrong type of the toner container .

In the eighth embodiment the container body including the spiral groove is used as the container body. However it may be possible to employ a toner container as illustrated in that includes as the container body the container body without the spiral groove as illustrated in and includes the container front end cover .

As examples of the identified portion provided on the container front end cover of the toner container first to fifteenth examples as illustrated in to may be employed. Among to figures denoted by symbols A C E and G illustrate front views of the container front end cover and figures denoted by symbols B D F and H illustrate bottom views of the container front end cover .

In to the reinforcing portion that is provided on and connected to the sliding guides and in the attachment direction is divided into six parts in the width direction W. For convenience sake the divided parts will be referred to as blocks to from the leftmost side in the attachment direction Q. Furthermore gaps provided on the respective blocks of the reinforcing portion are referred to as gaps to . In Table 1 below presence and absence of the gaps in the respective blocks are illustrated. In Table 1 Yes indicates that the gap is provided and No indicates that the gap is not provided.

In the first example illustrated in the gaps of the sliding guide are provided on the adjacent blocks and .

In the sixth example illustrated in the gaps of the sliding guide are provided on the adjacent blocks and .

In the tenth example illustrated in the gaps of the sliding guide are provided on the adjacent blocks and .

In the fourteenth example illustrated in the gaps of the sliding guide are provided on the blocks and .

In the fifteenth example illustrated in the gaps of the sliding guide are provided on the adjacent blocks and .

Even when the configuration is made as illustrated in the first to the fifteenth examples if the gaps of the sliding guide of the identified portion do not correspond to the identifying protrusions provided on the gutter the identified portion cannot pass over the identifying protrusions . Therefore it becomes possible to prevent attachment of an incompatible toner container .

The presence and absence of the gaps of the reinforcing portion according to the first to the fifteenth examples are illustrated in Table 1 below.

In a ninth embodiment a configuration of a container body serving as a powder storage of a toner container serving as a powder container differs from those of the container bodies and . Therefore the configuration of the container body will be mainly explained in the present embodiment and the container front end cover and other components having the same configurations as described above will be denoted by the same reference numerals and symbols and explanation thereof will be omitted appropriately.

As illustrated in a toner container serving as a powder container according to the present embodiment includes a container body for storing toner as a powder for image formation and a container front end cover serving as a container cover attached to the outer surface of the container body .

Third protrusions and serving as third conveyors are provided from the middle cylindrical portion A to the front cylindrical portion A. As illustrated in each of the third protrusions and is provided at a single position so as to be out of phase with each other by 180 degrees in the rotation direction arrow A direction of the container body and provided as singly. The third protrusions and are provided such that the protrusions are increased in size on the middle cylindrical portion A as illustrated in and are decreased in size toward the front cylindrical portion A as illustrated in . As illustrated in the third protrusions and are long enough to reach the front cylindrical portion A from the middle cylindrical portion A via the inclined portion A. Each of the third protrusions and is twisted so as to form a spiral that turns clockwise being a reverse direction of the rotation direction of the container body and applies a force in the arrow F direction to the contained toner when the container body rotates in the arrow A direction. Incidentally illustrates only the third protrusion

The second protrusions and and the third protrusions and are arranged such that the respective end portions lap over overlap with each other in the attachment detachment direction longitudinal direction . Furthermore as illustrated in the third protrusions and are provided so as to overlap with the nozzle hole serving as the powder receiving hole of the conveying nozzle when the conveying nozzle is inserted in the container body .

While the toner container including the container body configured as described above is attached to the toner replenishing device and the conveying nozzle is inserted in the container body as illustrated in the container body rotates in the arrow A direction. Therefore the toner in the rear cylindrical portion A of the container body is moved in the arrow F direction along the first protrusions and and is conveyed from the rear cylindrical portion A to the middle cylindrical portion A via the inclined portion A.

The conveyed toner and toner that has been located in the middle cylindrical portion A are moved in the arrow F direction by the second protrusions to and moved toward the front cylindrical portion A along the second protrusions to

In this case because the third protrusions and are arranged so as to overlap with the second protrusions to in the middle cylindrical portion A the toner conveyed by the second protrusions to can reliably be transferred to the third protrusion . Meanwhile explanation in connection with the third protrusion will be omitted. The transferred toner is moved in the arrow F direction by the third protrusions and passes over the inclined portion A and is conveyed to the front cylindrical portion A. In this case a front end of the third protrusion and a front end not illustrated of the third protrusion overlap with the nozzle hole of the conveying nozzle . Therefore the toner moved in the arrow F direction by the third protrusions and can reliably be conveyed to the nozzle hole .

While the two first protrusions and the two third protrusions are provided in the ninth embodiment it is sufficient to provide at least one first protrusion and one third protrusion.

While the first to the ninth embodiments are described in detail above they are mere examples. Any configurations made by combinations of arbitrary embodiments as described above fall within the scope of the present invention.

In a tenth embodiment a mechanism that improves the operability for attaching and detaching the toner container as described above to and from the toner replenishing device will be explained.

The toner container described in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 2012 133349 as described above includes a rotatable cylindrical powder storage a nozzle receiver attached to the powder storage an opening arranged on the nozzle receiver and an opening closing member that is biased to a closing position at which the opening is closed and that opens the opening along with insertion of a conveying nozzle of a powder replenishing device. When a toner container is set in a container holding section of the powder replenishing device and moved in the attachment direction the conveying nozzle is inserted in the nozzle receiver of the toner container with the movement of the toner container and the opening closing member is moved to the opening position to open the opening and discharge toner. Furthermore the conveying nozzle of the powder replenishing device is provided with a nozzle hole which is opened and closed by a nozzle shutter and which receives toner. The nozzle shutter is biased in a direction in which the nozzle hole is closed and opens the nozzle hole when the conveying nozzle is inserted in the nozzle receiver of the toner container so that the toner discharged from the toner container can be supplied into the conveying nozzle.

The powder replenishing device includes a replenishing device engaging member that maintains an attached state when the toner container is attached. By engaging the replenishing device engaging member with the toner container the attached state of the toner container is maintained.

Japanese Patent No. 4 958 325 discloses a replenishing device engaging member that maintains an opening closing member for opening and closing an opening arranged in a bottom portion of the toner container when the toner container is attached to the powder replenishing device.

In the configuration described in Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. 2012 133349 when the toner container is set in the powder replenishing device a force to bias the opening closing member of the toner container in the closing direction and a force to bias the nozzle shutter of the conveying nozzle in the closing direction act in a direction in which the toner container is detached from pushed out of the powder replenishing device. Therefore when a user pushes the toner container in the attachment direction to attach the toner container to the powder replenishing device he she attaches the toner container against the force in the detachment direction. In contrast when the toner container is pulled out to be detached a force in the detachment direction acts as an assist force. Therefore a difference between the operating force for attachment and the operating force for detachment is increased which may give the user a feeling that something is wrong in the attachment detachment operation. Furthermore the force in the detachment direction acts on the toner container in the attached state. Therefore the replenishing device engaging member that maintains the toner container in the attached state needs to have a holding force to keep holding the toner container against the force in the detachment direction so that a force to bias and hold the replenishing device engaging member toward the toner container also increases. Therefore when the user pulls out the toner container in the detachment direction from the attached state he she pulls out the toner container against the holding force of the replenishing device engaging member but after the toner container is pulled out the toner container moves in the detachment direction with the aid of the force in the detachment direction. This may also give the user an uncomfortable feeling in the attachment detachment operation.

Therefore in the present embodiment it is configured such that when the toner container is to be attached to the container holding section a first rotational moment to rotate the replenishing device engaging member to attach the toner container is greater than a second rotational moment to rotate the replenishing device engaging member to detach the toner container. Therefore a difference between the operating force for attachment and the operating force for detachment to attach and detach the toner container to and from the powder replenishing device can be reduced so that the attachment detachment operability can be improved.

A function to maintain the toner container in the attached state in the toner container holder will be explained in detail below with reference to FIG. and . and illustrate top cross sectional views of the toner container and the container cover receiving section of the toner container holder taken in the horizontal direction. is a diagram for explaining a state in which the toner container is being moved in the attachment direction Q. is a diagram for explaining a state in which the toner container has reached the container cover receiving section and the conveying nozzle is entered in the container body by pushing open the container shutter inside the receiving opening of the toner container . illustrates the attached state in which the left and right engaging members have passed over the bumps and entered into the engaged openings to hold the toner container in an attached position.

Each of the tip parts of the engaging members on the left and right sides includes a first inclined surface that comes in contact with the container engaged portion when the toner container is moved in the attachment direction Q and a second inclined surface that comes in contact with the container engaged portion when the toner container in the engaged state is moved in a detachment direction Q. The first inclined surface and the second inclined surface define an approximately triangular cross section in the figures and a tip portion defined by those surfaces is referred to as a top portion P. As illustrated in each of the engaging members is mounted on the setting cover so as to rotate about the shaft extending in the direction normal to the sheet of . In each of the engaging members the spring press part receives a biasing force of the torsion coil spring and the rotation stopper near the spring press part is brought into contact with the setting cover notch of the setting cover . Therefore the positions of the engaging members in the engaging direction R are restricted such that the top portions P see serving as the top portions of the approximate triangles protrude from the inner surface of setting cover so as to face each other. In the explanation below the positions of the engaging members in the rotation direction illustrated in are assumed as the initial positions.

In each of the left and right container engaged portions of the toner container the guiding protrusion the guiding groove the bump and the engaged opening are arranged as guiding portions in this order from the container front side as described above. Each of the bumps includes a first contact surface that is an inclined surface connected from the guiding groove and a second contact surface that is an inclined surface connected to the engaged opening adjacent to the engaged opening . The first contact surfaces and the second contact surfaces define approximately triangular cross sections in the figures. Each of the bumps is provided on the container cover such that the top portion of the approximate triangle as described above protrudes outward.

As illustrated in a user pushes the new toner container in the attachment direction Q to attach the toner container . Accordingly the container front end of the container shutter comes in contact with the front end of the conveying nozzle the end on the upstream side in the attachment direction Q . When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the container shutter moves to the rear side of the toner container and the conveying nozzle starts to be entered into the toner container . At this time the user who is operating the toner container gradually feels a reaction force restoring force against a compression force of the container shutter spring as the conveying nozzle is entered further into the toner container .

Incidentally the shutter hooks of the container shutter on the container rear end may include a step to be hooked on the outer wall surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion . In this configuration when releasing the hooked state of the shutter hooks the user operating the toner container slightly feels a force reaction force to push the toner container back in the opposite direction the detachment direction Q of the attachment direction Q before the container shutter starts moving to the rear side of the toner container .

When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the guiding protrusions of the toner container come in contact with the first inclined surfaces of the left and right engaging members . Each of the guiding protrusions serving as guiding portions includes the guiding inclined surface that is an inclined surface continuing from the central axis side to the outer periphery side of the container cover see and causes the left and right engaging members to rotate about the shafts in the releasing direction R so as to be pushed opened from the initial positions against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs when the toner container is gradually pushed in the attachment direction Q.

At this time the user operating the toner container feels a reaction force a force due to the restoring forces of the torsion coil springs of the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs that cause the left and right engaging members to move back to the initial positions in addition to the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring . However because the guiding protrusions include the guiding inclined surfaces that gradually push open the engaging members it is possible to reduce an uncomfortable operational feeling as compared to a configuration in which the guiding protrusions having the guiding inclined surfaces are not provided.

In contrast if the front end of the container cover is provided as corner portions without providing the guiding inclined surfaces the user feels at a time a strong reaction force in the direction Q in which the toner container is pushed back when the engaging members and the container cover come in contact with each other and may erroneously recognize that the attachment is completed because of the reaction force. Therefore it is preferable to provide the guiding protrusions having the guiding inclined surfaces as in the present embodiment. Incidentally if the guiding protrusions protrude to the container front side as in the present embodiment it becomes easy to catch the tip parts of the engaging members . However it may be possible to provide only the guiding inclined surfaces without protrusions toward the container front side.

In contrast in the state illustrated in the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter arranged on the outer periphery of the conveying nozzle comes in contact with the container front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs arranged on the inner periphery of the nozzle receiver . Therefore when the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the nozzle shutter starts to be pushed in the attachment direction Q because of the contact with the nozzle shutter positioning ribs . At this time the user operating the toner container feels the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring in addition to the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the container shutter spring .

When the toner container in the state illustrated in is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the first inclined surfaces of the tip parts of the engaging members and the first contact surface of the bumps come in contact with each other respectively. When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q from the contact positions between the first inclined surfaces and the first contact surfaces the first inclined surfaces of the left and right engaging members are pressed by the first contact surfaces and rotated outward about the shaft in the releasing direction R from the contact positions between the top portions of the tip parts and the guiding grooves in the direction perpendicular to the attachment direction Q against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs . At this time the user operating the toner container feels a reaction force a force due to the restoring forces of the torsion coil springs of the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members outward from the contact positions between the top portions of the tip parts and the guiding grooves against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs that closes the left and right engaging members toward the initial positions in addition to the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring .

When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q the reaction force against the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members outward becomes maximum at a position at which the top portions of the approximate triangles of the bumps come in contact with the top portions P of the approximate triangles of the tip parts the opposed position .

When the toner container is further pushed in the attachment direction Q and passes through the above described position the first inclined surfaces of the tip parts and the first contact surfaces of the bumps are separated from each other so that the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members outward stops acting on the engaging members and the engaging members rotate about the shafts in the engaging direction R due to the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs a restoring force against compression . At this time because the engaged openings are provided on the outer surface of the container cover so as to be located on the trajectories of the movement of the top portions P of the approximately triangular tip parts around the shaft the top portions P of the approximately triangular tip parts of the engaging members are entered into the engaged openings and the engaging members are moved back to the initial positions as illustrated in so that the toner container is completely attached to the toner container holder .

The user operating the toner container feels that the reaction force does not act immediately after the reaction force against the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members outward becomes maximum so that he she can recognize that the attachment of the toner container to the toner container holder is completed. Meanwhile a feeling that the user feels from when the top portions P of the tip parts pass over the bumps of the container engaged portions and reach the engaged openings is a so called click feeling.

In the attached state of the toner container as illustrated in the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring are applied to the toner container . However the engaged openings of the container engaged portions of the container cover are engaged with the engaging members and the engaging members receive a resultant force of the reaction forces as described above hereinafter the resultant force is referred to as a restoring spring force so that the toner container is held in the toner container holder . Specifically as illustrated in the second inclined surfaces of the tip part of the engaging members come in contact with the second contact surfaces of the bumps connected to the front ends of the engaged openings of the container engaged portions and therefore the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring are applied. However the engaging members can be maintained in the initial positions because of the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs so that the toner container can be maintained in the attached state.

Next a case will be explained below in which the user detaches the toner container in the detachment direction Q from the attached state illustrated in to replace the toner container . When the user pulls the toner container maintained in the attached state as illustrated in by gripping the gripper see a force to pull out the toner container is applied to the toner container by the user in addition to the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring as described above. At this time the second inclined surfaces of the engaging members receive these forces via the second contact surfaces of the toner container . When the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs applied to the engaging members are greater than the above described forces the toner container can be maintained in the attached state. In contrast when the user increases the pulling force and the above described forces become greater than the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs the engaging members are rotated about the shaft in the opening direction the releasing direction R .

When the user further pulls the toner container in the detachment direction Q he she needs to apply the greatest puling force immediately before the top portions of the approximately triangular bumps reach the positions facing the top portions P of the tip parts . At the positions at which the top portions of the approximately triangular bumps face the top portions P of the tip parts the reaction force against the force the pushes open the left and right engaging members outward becomes maximum. When the toner container passes through this position the second inclined surfaces of the tip parts and the second contact surfaces of the bumps are separated from each other so that the force that pushes open the left and right engaging members does not act on the engaging members and the engaging members rotate about the shafts in the engaging direction R due to the biasing forces of the torsion coil spring a restoring force against compression . Subsequently the tip parts of the engaging members come in contact with the guiding grooves of the container cover . At this time the reaction force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring act in the same direction so as to accelerate the movement of the toner container in the detachment direction Q. With the assist by these forces the user can detach the toner container from the toner container holder and take the toner container from the front side of the copier the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of .

As described above when the toner container is in the attached state the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring act on the toner container in the detachment direction Q opposite to the attachment direction Q. Therefore the spring pressure pressure load by the spring of the torsion coil springs that bias the engaging members to the initial positions is set to be greater than the reaction forces so as to be able to hold the toner container.

Therefore when the toner container is pushed in the attachment direction Q from the state illustrated in to the attached state illustrated in to attach the toner container the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring and the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs that bias the engaging members to the initial positions act in the detachment direction Q opposite to the attachment direction Q that is the moving direction of the toner container . Therefore the user pushes the toner container in the attachment direction Q against the above forces.

In contrast when the toner container is pulled in the detachment direction Q while the toner container is pulled against the biasing forces of the torsion coil springs that bias the engaging members to the initial positions similarly to the attachment operation the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring act as an assist force in the detachment direction Q that is the moving direction of the toner container .

Therefore a difference between the operating force to attach the toner container to the toner container holder and the operating force to detach the toner container from the toner container holder is increased and this may give the user an uncomfortable feeling in the attachment detachment operation.

Therefore in the present embodiment the shapes of the engaging members and the shapes of the container engaged portions are conceived so that a difference between the user s operating force for attachment and the user s operating force for detachment can be reduced. Specifically the engaging members and the container engaged portions are configured such that the first rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R due to a force in the attachment direction Q applied by the user to attach the toner container becomes greater than the second rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R due to a force in the detachment direction Q applied by the user to detach the toner container .

With this configuration it becomes possible to more easily rotate the engaging members when the toner container is attached as compared when the toner container is detached. Furthermore the rotation of the engaging members becomes heavier when the toner container is detached as compared when the toner container is attached.

Therefore when the user attaches the toner container he she applies a force against the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring in the detachment direction Q to move the toner container toward the toner container holder but receives less forces from the engaging members that act due to the attachment. In contrast when the user pulls the toner container the restoring forces of the two springs such as the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring in the detachment direction Q act as an assist force but the forces received from the engaging members that act due to the detachment are increased relative to the forces received during the attachment of the toner container .

As described above it becomes possible to reduce a difference in the user s operating force between attachment and detachment of the toner container to and from the toner container holder of the toner replenishing device . Therefore it becomes possible to improve the attachment detachment operability.

A relationship between forces applied to the engaging members will be explained below with reference to to . illustrates a state in which the guiding protrusion comes in contact with the engaging member due to the pushing in the attachment direction Q. illustrates a state immediately before the attached state is obtained due to the pushing in the attachment direction Q. In the guiding protrusion the guiding inclined surface the guiding groove and the engaging member on one side on the left side viewed from the container front end to the container rear end are illustrated. In the guiding groove the bump the engaged opening and the engaging member on one side on the left side viewed from the container front end to the container rear end are illustrated.

A relationship of rotational moments generated on the engaging members when the toner container is set in the attachment direction Q will be explained below with reference to and . In this case a restoring spring force F that is a resultant force of the reaction force restoring force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the reaction force restoring force against the compression force the nozzle shutter spring acts on the toner container in the detachment direction Q. Furthermore in U represents a force applied by a user to push the toner container in the attachment direction Q while the guiding inclined surfaces of the guiding protrusions of the container cover and the top portions P of the tip parts of the engaging members are in contact with each other. Moreover a setting force S to set the toner container in the attachment direction Q is represented by S U F because the restoring spring force F as described above acts in the detachment direction Q opposite to the attachment direction Q.

It is necessary to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R such that the left and right guiding inclined surfaces of the toner container push open the left and right engaging members by the setting force S to set the toner container in the attachment direction Q.

First a rotational moment M serving as a third rotational moment that acts in the releasing direction R will be described below. In a normal force Sdue to the setting force S acts on the engaging members . Specifically because the top portion P of the tip part of the engaging member is in contact with the guiding inclined surface the normal force Sacts in a direction perpendicular to the tangent at the contact point between the top portion P of the tip part and the guiding inclined surface i.e. in a direction connecting the contact point and the center of the R surface . The normal force Sacts as the rotational moment in the releasing direction R.

In this case the normal force Scan be represented as a component of the setting force S in the direction perpendicular to the tangent at the contact point between the top portion P of the tip part and the guiding inclined surface . Therefore the normal force Sis represented as follows S1n S1 COS 1 where is an angle between the direction in which the normal force Sacts and the attachment direction Q in which the setting force S acts 0

Furthermore because the two engaging members are provided on the left and right sides of the toner container a force that acts on each of the left and right engaging members is represented as S

Therefore the rotational moment M to rotate each of the engaging members in the releasing direction R such that the left and right guiding inclined surfaces of the toner container push open the left and right engaging members as illustrated in is represented as follows 1 11 1 COS 1 1 where the releasing direction R is clockwise in the figure.

Incidentally L is a distance between a first line and a second line. The first line is perpendicular to the tangent at the contact point between the top portion P of the tip part and the guiding inclined surface . The second line passes through the rotation center P of the shaft serving as a fulcrum and is parallel to the line perpendicular to the tangent. That is L is the length of a moment arm of S

In contrast the engaging member is biased by a spring force Fsp of the torsion coil spring in the engaging direction.

As for a rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R similarly to the above the rotational moment M is represented as follows 2 2 where the engaging direction is counterclockwise in the figure.

Incidentally L is a distance between a third line and a fourth line. The third line passes through a position the spring press part at which the spring force of the torsion coil spring acts. The fourth line passes through the rotation center P and is parallel to the line passing through the spring press part. That is L is the length of a moment arm of the spring force Fsp.

Therefore to move the toner container in the attachment direction Q toward the toner container holder the rotational moment M that acts in the releasing direction R needs to be greater than the rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R.

In this case because S U F the force U to push the toner container in the attachment direction Q is represented as follows by solving the above relational expression for U by assigning S U F to the relational expression. 1 2 COS 1 2 1 1 

Furthermore the reaction force that acts on the toner container due to the contact between the guiding inclined surface and the top portion P of the engaging member has the same magnitude as that of the normal force of Sand acts in the opposite direction of the normal force of S. Therefore a component of force in the detachment direction Q is represented as SCOS . Accordingly a reaction force Cf perceived by a user who causes the toner container to move in the attachment direction Q in the state illustrated in is the same as a sum of the restoring spring force F and the component of force and is represented as Cf F SCOS where the reaction force Cf acts in the detachment direction Q. The reaction force Cf becomes minimum when 2. This is when the contact state is obtained such that becomes a right angle with respect to the attachment direction Q that is when the top portion P of the tip part of the engaging member is in contact with the guiding groove of the container engaged portion .

Next a relationship of rotational moments that act on the engaging members when the top portions P of the tip parts of the engaging members pass over the bumps of the toner container will be explained below with reference to .

In the present embodiment the bumps in the form of protrusions are provided on the container cover to give a click feeling to indicate completion of attachment when the toner container is attached to the toner container holder . Assuming that similarly to the above descriptions with reference to a force applied by a user to push the toner container in the attachment direction Q is denoted by U and the restoring spring force in the detachment direction Q is denoted by F a setting force S to set the toner container in the attachment direction Q is represented by S U F.

It is necessary to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R such that the bumps the first contact surfaces of the toner container can pass over the tip parts the first inclined surfaces of the engaging members by the setting force S to set the toner container in the attachment direction Q.

First a rotational moment M serving as the first rotational moment that rotates the engaging members in the releasing direction R will be described below.

The first contact surface of the bump is in contact with the first inclined surface of the engaging member . Therefore a force Sthat is a component of the setting force S in the direction perpendicular to the first inclined surface of the engaging member acts as the rotational moment M in the releasing direction R.

In this case the force Sas a component of the setting force S is represented as follows S2n S2 COS 2 where is an angle between the direction perpendicular to the first inclined surface and the attachment direction Q in which the setting force S acts.

The engaging members are provided in two positions in particular on the left and right sides of the toner container . Therefore a force that acts on each of the first inclined surfaces is represented as S

Therefore the rotational moment M in the releasing direction R when the toner container is attached in the attachment direction Q as illustrated in is represented as follows 3 23 2COS 2 3 where the releasing direction R is clockwise in the figure.

Incidentally L is a distance between a fifth line and a sixth line. The fifth line is perpendicular to the first inclined surface and is drawn from the contact point between the first contact surface and the first inclined surface . The sixth line passes through the rotation center P of the shaft serving as a fulcrum and is parallel to the line perpendicular to the first inclined surface. That is L is the length of a moment arm of the force of S

Furthermore a rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R is the same as the rotational moment M and is represented as follows 4 2 where the engaging direction R is counterclockwise in the figure.

Therefore to set the toner container the relationship of the moments needs to be set such that the rotational moment that acts in the engaging direction R becomes grater than the rotational moment that acts in the releasing direction R in other words such that M M. Therefore the relationship of S COS L Fsp L is satisfied.

In this case because S U F the force U to push the toner container in the attachment direction Q is represented as follows by solving the above relational expression for U by assigning S U F to the relational expression. 2 2 COS 2 2 3 2 

Furthermore the reaction force that acts on the toner container due to the contact between the first contact surface of the bump and the first inclined surface of the engaging member has the same magnitude as that of the normal component of Sand acts in the opposite direction of the normal component of S. Therefore a component of force in the detachment direction Q is represented as SCOS . Accordingly a reaction force Cf perceived by the user who causes the toner container to move in the attachment direction Q in the state illustrated in is the same as a sum of the restoring spring force F and the component of force and is represented as Cf F SCOS where the reaction force Cf acts in the detachment direction Q.

The reaction force Cf is greater than the reaction force Cf as described above. The user first feels the reaction force Cf and immediately after this feels that the reaction force Cf stops acting because the tip parts of the engaging members are entered into the engaged openings . Therefore the user can recognize that the attachment of the toner container to the toner container holder is completed. As described above by causing the user to feel a difference in the reaction force such that the reaction force is increased once and is immediately reduced so that a so called click feeling is given to the user.

Incidentally the rotational moment M serving as the third rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R is greater than the rotational moment M serving as the first rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R.

Next a relationship of rotational moments that act on the engaging members in the attached state in which the second inclined surfaces of the tip parts of the engaging members and the second contact surfaces of the bumps of the toner container are in contact with each other will be explained below with reference to .

In the attached state the restoring spring force F that is a resultant force of the restoring force against the compression force of the container shutter spring and the restoring force against the compression force of the nozzle shutter spring acts on the toner container in the detachment direction Q.

The condition to prevent the toner container from being pushed out in the detachment direction Q due to the restoring spring force F is that the engaging member does not rotate clockwise in the releasing direction R about the shaft serving as the fulcrum in the attached state illustrated in . Therefore it is sufficient that the rotational moment about the fulcrum of the engaging member acts counterclockwise in the engaging direction R . In the case of the left engaging member the opposite is applied therefore it is sufficient that the rotational moment about the shaft as a fulcrum of the engaging member acts clockwise in the engaging direction .

First a rotational moment M that acts in the releasing direction is described below. The second inclined surface of the engaging member is in contact with the second contact surface of the bump . Therefore a force Fn which is a component of the restoring spring force F and perpendicular to the second inclined surface of the engaging member acts as the rotational moment M in the releasing direction R.

In this case the force Fn as the component of the restoring spring force F is represented as follows Fn FCOS 3 where is an angle between the direction perpendicular to the second inclined surface and the detachment direction Q in which the restoring spring force F acts.

The engaging members are provided in two positions in particular on the left and right sides of the toner container . Therefore a force that acts on each of the second inclined surfaces is represented as Fn.

Therefore the rotational moment M in the releasing direction R in the attached state illustrated in is represented as follows 5 4 COS 3 4 where the releasing direction R is clockwise in the figure.

Incidentally L is a distance between a seventh line and a eighth line. The seventh line is perpendicular to the second inclined surface and is drawn from the contact point between the second contact surface and the second inclined surface . The eighth line passes through the rotation center P of the shaft serving as the fulcrum and is parallel to the line perpendicular to the second inclined surface. That is L is the length of a moment arm of the force of Fn.

Furthermore a rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R is the same as the rotational moment M or M and is represented as follows M6 Fsp L2 where the engaging direction R is counterclockwise in the figure.

Therefore to maintain the attached state in which the toner container is held in the attached position in the toner replenishing device the relationship of the moments needs to be set such that the rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R becomes greater than the rotational moment M that acts in the releasing direction R. Therefore the relationship of F COS L

Next a relationship of rotational moments generated on the engaging members when the user pulls out the toner container in the detachment direction Q will be explained below with reference to . First a rotational moment M serving as the second rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R will be described below.

Assuming that a force applied by a user to pull out the toner container in the detachment direction Q is denoted by U because the restoring spring force F also acts in the same direction a pulling force S to pull out the toner container in the detachment direction Q is represented as S U F.

A force S which is a component of the pulling force S and perpendicular to the second inclined surface of the engaging member i.e. a component in the direction perpendicular to the tangent at the contact point between the second inclined surface of the engaging member and the second contact surface of the container engaged portion acts as the rotational moment M in the releasing direction R.

Incidentally it is necessary to adjust the slope of the second inclined surface of the engaging member and the second contact surface of the container engaged portion such that the rotation center P of the engaging member is not located on the direction in which the force Sacts.

In this case the force Sas the component of the pulling force S is represented as follows S3n S3 COS 3 where is an angle between the direction perpendicular to the second inclined surface and the detachment direction Q in which the pulling force S acts.

The engaging members are provided in two positions in particular on the left and right sides of the toner container . Therefore a force that acts on each of the second inclined surfaces is represented as S

Therefore the rotational moment M in the releasing direction R to pull out the toner container in the detachment direction Q in the state illustrated in is represented as follows 7 34 3 COS 3 4 where the releasing direction R is clockwise in the figure.

Incidentally L is a distance between the seventh line and the eighth line. The seventh line is perpendicular to the second inclined surface and is drawn from the contact point between the second contact surface and the second inclined surface . The eighth line passes through the rotation center P of the shaft serving as the fulcrum and is parallel to the line perpendicular to the second inclined surface. That is L is the length of the moment arm of the force of S

Furthermore a rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R is the same as the rotational moment M M or M and is represented as follows 8 2 where the engaging direction R is counterclockwise in the figure.

Therefore to pull out the toner container in the detachment direction Q the relationship of the moments needs to be set such that the rotational moment M that acts in the releasing direction R becomes greater than the rotational moment M that acts in the engaging direction R in other words such that M M. Therefore the relationship of S COS L Fsp L is satisfied.

In this case because S U F the force U to pull out the toner container in the detachment direction Q is represented as follows by solving the above relational expression for U by assigning S U F to the relational expression. 3 2 COS 3 2 4 3 

Furthermore the reaction force that acts on the toner container due to the contact between the second contact surface of the bump and the second inclined surface of the engaging member has the same magnitude as that of the normal component of Sand acts in the opposite direction of the normal component of S. Therefore a component of force in the detachment direction Q is represented as SCOS . Accordingly a reaction force Cf perceived by the user who causes the toner container to move in the detachment direction Q in the state illustrated in is the same as a sum of the restoring spring force F and the component force and is represented as Cf F SCOS where the reaction force Cf acts in the detachment direction Q.

Incidentally the rotational moment M serving as the first rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R is greater than the rotational moment M serving as the second rotational moment to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R.

As described above when pushing the toner container in the attachment direction Q the user first applies the pushing force U to the toner container and subsequently applies the pushing force U. Furthermore when pulling out the toner container in the detachment direction Q the user applies the pulling force U to the toner container .

The lower limit of the pushing force U is obtained by Expression 1 as described above the lower limit of the pushing force U is obtained by Expression 2 as described above and the lower limit of the pulling force U is obtained by Expression 3 as described above.

The relationship of the magnitudes of the operating forces and the reaction forces are set as follows. 1

By setting all of the parameters L L L L Fsp and F used in Expressions 4 to 7 such that Expressions 4 to 7 can be satisfied simultaneously and in particular by increasing a difference between the rotational moment M to rotate the engaging members at the time of attachment and the rotational moment M to rotate the engaging members at the time of detachment it becomes possible to reduce a difference between the operating force U and the operating force U used to attach and detach the powder container to and from the powder replenishing device. As a result it becomes possible to improve the attachment detachment operability.

Each of the parameters L L L L Fsp and F can be set as desired by appropriately setting the spring pressure of the container shutter spring and the shapes of the container engaged portions of the container cover of the toner container and by setting the spring force of the nozzle shutter spring the shapes of the engaging members and the spring pressure of the torsion coil spring of the toner replenishing device .

In the engaging member is illustrated such that the longitudinal direction thereof is oriented parallel to the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q.

In inclined angles and that are respective angles of the second inclined surface and the first inclined surface of the tip part on which a contact point the point of action of the container engaged portion moves is set to 45 with respect to the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the engaging members . Furthermore a length L from the top portion P of the tip part to the rotation center P in the attachment detachment direction is set to 12.37 mm. Moreover a length L from the top portion P of the tip part to the rotation center P in the width direction W the direction perpendicular to the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q is set to 8.5 mm.

Therefore it becomes possible to reduce a difference between the pushing force U and the pulling force U to be applied to the toner container by the user and to approximately equalize the pushing force U and the pulling force U.

As a result it becomes possible to reduce a difference in the operating force between attachment and detachment of the toner container to and from the toner replenishing device the toner container holder enabling to improve the operability.

More specifically it is preferable to set the user s operating force to attach and detach the toner container containing 400 to 500 grams of toner to 50 N or less and it is more preferable to set the operating force to 30 N or less. Furthermore if a difference between the user s operating force to attach the toner container to the toner container holder and the user s operating force to detach the toner container from the toner container holder is set to 3 N or less it becomes possible to reduce an uncomfortable feeling that may be perceived by the user in the detachment operation.

Incidentally because the toner container of the present embodiment includes the container shutter spring and the nozzle shutter spring if the toner container is to be attached to the toner container holder against the resultant force the restoring spring force F of the forces of the springs as described above the user s operating forces U and U in the attachment direction Q are increased by the resultant force the restoring spring force F .

Furthermore the resultant force the restoring spring force F acts even in the attached state in which the toner container is set in the toner container holder . Therefore to reliably hold the toner container it is necessary to cause the engaging members serving as the replenishing device engaging members to apply a relatively large holding force to the toner container .

However if the holding force of the engaging members in the attached state is increased as described above it becomes necessary to further increase the user s operating forces U and U in the attachment direction Q. Furthermore to achieve the click feeling to allow the user to recognize completion of the setting it is necessary to ensure a difference in the user s operating force before and after the tip parts of the engaging members pass over the bumps . Therefore it becomes necessary to increase the user s operating force U relative to the user s operating force U.

Therefore the container cover of the present embodiment includes the guiding inclined surfaces and the bumps serving as a force converting portion that generate forces to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R about the shafts against the rotational moments M M M and M in the engaging direction R of the engaging members .

Specifically when the toner container is moved in the attachment direction Q toward the toner container holder the guiding inclined surfaces and the first inclined surfaces of the engaging members come in contact with each other. The contact points on the first inclined surfaces of the engaging members due to the contact serve as the points of action to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R about the shafts . And the distance in the direction perpendicular to the rotational force from the centers P of the shafts to a line passing through the points of action serves as the arms L of the rotational moments M of the engaging members about the shafts .

Similarly when the first contact surfaces and the first inclined surfaces come in contact with each other the contact points on the first inclined surfaces of the engaging members due to the contact serve as the points of action to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R about the shafts . And distances in the direction perpendicular to the rotational force from the centers P of the shafts to the points of action serve as the arms L of the rotational moments M of the engaging members about the shafts .

When the toner container is moved from the toner container holder in the detachment direction Q the second contact surfaces and the second inclined surfaces of the engaging members come in contact with each other. The contact points on the second inclined surfaces of the engaging members due to the contact serve as the points of action to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R about the shafts . And distances in the direction perpendicular to the rotational force from the centers P of the shafts to the points of action serve as the arms L of the rotational moments M of the engaging members about the shafts .

In the present embodiment the guiding inclined surfaces the first contact surfaces and the second contact surfaces all of which serve as force transducers are provided in the container cover and the first inclined surfaces and the second inclined surfaces are provided in the engaging members serving as the replenishing device engaging members. Therefore the positions of the points of action to attach the toner container to the toner container holder are different from the positions of the points of action to detach the toner container from the toner container holder .

Therefore the lengths L L and L of the arms of the rotational moments of the engaging members about the shafts are different from one another such that L L L so that the engaging members can be rotated by a smaller force when the toner container is attached and the engaging members are rotated by a greater force when the toner container is detached as compared when the toner container is attached. Consequently it becomes possible to reduce a difference in the user s operating force between the attachment and detachment of the toner container to and from the toner container holder of the toner replenishing device serving as the powder replenishing device. As a result it becomes possible to improve the attachment detachment operability.

In the present embodiment the toner container including the container body provided with the spiral groove and including the container cover rotatably attached to the container body is described as an example of the powder container however the configuration is not limited thereto. For example the container body may include a conveyor such as a screw inside the container. Furthermore it may be possible to mount the IC tag IC chip which serves as an information storage device on the container cover and mount the connector which serves as a reader to read information by coming into contact with the IC tag on the toner replenishing device .

In the tenth embodiment the container body including the spiral groove is used as the container body. However as the container body it may be possible to mount the container engaged portions of the present embodiment on the toner container of the other embodiments illustrated in and . Namely the engaging members and the container engaged portions are configured such that the first rotational moment M to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R due to the force in the attachment direction Q applied by the user to attach the toner container becomes greater than the second rotational moment M to rotate the engaging members in the releasing direction R due to the force in the detachment direction Q applied by the user to detach the toner container . Therefore similarly to the tenth embodiment it becomes possible to reduce a difference in the user s operating force between attachment and detachment of the toner container serving as the powder container to and from the toner container holder of the toner replenishing device serving as the powder replenishing device. As a result it becomes possible to improve the attachment detachment operability.

The opening is to mate with the container receiving section.
