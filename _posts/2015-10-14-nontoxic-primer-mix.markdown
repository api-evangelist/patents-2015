title: Non-toxic primer mix
abstract: A non-toxic primer mix in which DBX-1 (copper(I) 5-nitrotetrazole) acts as the primary explosive portion of the primer. Furthermore, in this mix, boron carbide (BC) replaces the traditional frictionator/fuel, toxic antimony trisulfide. In addition, potassium nitrate replaces the toxic barium nitrate (BaNO)) as the oxidizer, providing an ignition flame from the primer in a pyrotechnic reaction. The non-toxic primer therefore embodies a lead-free, barium-free, antimony-free explosive material that can include added fuels, sensitizers, explosives and/or binders.

The present application is related to co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 14 672 680 filed Mar. 30 2015 which is incorporated herein in its entirety.

This invention relates to explosives and particularly to a non toxic primer that embodies a lead free barium free antimony free explosive material and that additionally includes added fuels sensitizers explosives and or binders.

A percussion primer is a critical energy transducer used for converting a mechanical impetus into rapid chemical energy for most armament ignition trains in particular for small arms ammunition used by both commercial and military sectors. Primers contain impact and friction sensitive mixes adapted to the armament system of design and are usually composed of common explosives and pyrotechnic components that have gradually evolved over time.

Over 100 years ago mercury fulminate based formulations were the most commonly used primer mixes. In the 1920s alternate priming mixes were found to replace mercury fulminate as this previous composition was found to deteriorate rapidly under tropical conditions and cause potential health problems or concerns such as lethargy and nausea to the shooter after firing. However the alternate mixes that were based on lead thiocyanate potassium chlorate formulations were soon recognized as detrimental to weapon barrels because of the formation of corrosive water soluble potassium chloride salts upon combustion. Later primer mixes developed in the 1950s were based on the primary explosive lead styphnate in its normal form lead II 2 4 6 trinitro m resorcinate a substance which is much more stable than mercury fulminate.

Currently the most commonly used primer mixes are chemical mixtures comprising at least a primary explosive and pyrotechnic mixes comprising oxidizing agents and fuel source.

Primary explosives are essential components in primers as they are directly responsible for converting a relatively small stimulus i.e. a small quantity of energy in the form of an impact friction shock heat or electrostatic discharge into a large chemical energy release capable of igniting the fuel oxidizer components of the mixture. In the case of primer formulations the most common primary is lead styphnate also known as lead trinitrorescorcinate which has two commercially used chemical forms normal lead styphnate lead II 2 4 6 trinitro m phenylene dioxide CHNOPb and basic lead styphnate lead II hydroxide 2 4 6 m phenylene dioxide CHNOPb . Both forms possess very similar performance and are often used interchangeably. Either form of lead styphnate generally requires the addition of a second primary explosive tetrazene in the formulation to enhance the primer s reliability.

Lead styphnate a primary explosive may be combined with the weaker but more sensitive explosive tetrazene 1 5 tetrazolyl 3 guanyl tetrazene hydrate also sometimes referred to as tetracene to render the lead styphnate based primer composition sufficiently sensitive to percussion.

Unfortunately regardless of such desirable explosive properties the lead found in lead styphnate is both an acute and chronic toxin and the human body has difficulty in removing it once it has been absorbed and dissolved in the blood. Also the manufacturing of these lead based primary explosives results in the production of significant quantities of highly toxic hazardous waste. Handling and use of these lead base primary explosives results in further exposure as well as the wide dissemination of lead containing combustion by products.

Other additives in primer compositions also contribute to toxic effects in humans. For instance barium nitrate a common oxidizing agent chosen primarily for its low hygroscopicity can cause cardiac arrest and respiratory failure leading to death.

Numerous attempts have been made towards producing an effective non toxic primer composition. As used herein non toxic is intended to mean a substance consisting essentially of materials that are not toxic heavy metals such as lead or barium known carcinogens or poisons especially when vaporized burnt or exploded as in the firing of an ammunition round .

In the production of non toxic primer mixes 2 diazo 4 6 dinitro phenol DDNP is often a preferred lead free substitute for lead styphnate as the primary explosive. Like lead styphnate DDNP typically is accompanied by tetrazene as a secondary primary explosive to render the composition sufficiently sensitive to percussion. However DDNP based mixes have not found military use in the U.S. and have largely been relegated to practice ammunition in the commercial sector. The primary reason for the lack of utility is DDNP s poor performance at low temperatures.

Alternate primer mix designs have focused on eliminating the primary explosive as well as ability to be manufactured through automation such as red phosphorus RP based primers and the nanothermite based Metastable Intermolecular Composites MIC developed in the last 12 years for military primers. Red phosphorous reacts slowly with air and moisture to form highly toxic phosphine gas and further can corrode brass which is the most commonly used material for ammunition casings. MICs require metal nano powders to function and therefore possess significant inhalation safety concerns they are further almost always based on nano aluminum which degrades in the presence of moisture and can have pyrophoric qualities.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 833 330 by Fronabager et al. discloses the use of DBX 1 copper I 5 nitrotetrazolate as a potentially useful lead free substitute for lead azide. It is not hygroscopic does not contain highly toxic metals is thermally stable functions well at ambient and cold temperatures and possesses comparable sensitivity to lead azide and lead styphnate. Given that conventional wisdom in the field has held that lead azide being a more brisant less heat generating compound compared to lead styphnate was not suitable for use in primer applications where flame high temperature and slag are desired outputs.

The United States Military armaments are subjected to rigor of high standard performance stability and cost assessments. Commercial primer manufacturers are attempting to develop non toxic primer compositions to meet the strict evaluations set by the military. With a recent development of a direct lead azide replacement DBX 1 and concurrent pyrotechnic exploration with new materials of commercial and military interest primer mix design expands into new territory.

So while there has been some progress in establishing a lead free replacement for lead azide there is still a need in the art for a lead free i.e. environmentally green safe replacement for the primer composition as a whole.

To fulfill the foregoing need in the art the present invention describes a new non toxic primer composition and associated method of preparation. The primer mix completely replaces heavy metal compounds and natural gum binders found in primer formulations while still maintaining stringent military performance requirements.

This composition embodies a lead free barium free antimony free explosive material and that additionally includes added fuels sensitizers explosives and or binders. The non toxic primer composition or mix may include DBX 1 by itself or in the presence of tetrazene tetracene as the primary explosives portion.

In a further embodiment boron carbide aluminum and potassium nitrate are included as the pyrotechnic portion of the primer mix where boron carbide and aluminum serve as non toxic fuels for the non toxic oxidizer of potassium nitrate in the production of ignition flame. Boron carbide also serves as a frictionator due to its highly abrasive qualities thus enhancing the impact and friction sensitivity of the mix.

Table I below illustrates a conventional e.g. standard FA 956 primer formulation compared to Table II below which illustrates an exemplary primer mix according to one embodiment of the present invention 

The nature of the subject invention will be more clearly understood by reference to the following drawings detailed description and the appended claims.

The present invention describes a new non toxic primer composition or mix and associated method of preparation. In this primer mix DBX 1 copper I 5 nitrotetrazole replaces lead styphnate and acts as the primary explosive portion of the primer. Boron carbide BC replaces the traditional frictionator fuel toxic antimony trisulfide. In addition potassium nitrate replaces the toxic barium nitrate Ba NO as the oxidizer providing an ignition flame from the primer in a pyrotechnic reaction.

Therefore the primer mix completely replaces heavy metal compounds and natural gum binders found in primer formulations while still maintaining military performance requirements. It embodies a lead free barium free antimony free explosive material which additionally can include added fuels sensitizers explosives and or binders.

In one embodiment the non toxic primer mix may include DBX 1 by itself or in the presence of tetrazene tetracene as the primary explosives portion.

In a further embodiment boron carbide aluminum and potassium nitrate are included as the pyrotechnic portion of the primer mix where boron carbide and aluminum serve as non toxic fuels for the non toxic oxidizer of potassium nitrate in the production of ignition flame. Boron carbide also serves as a frictionator due to its highly abrasive qualities thus enhancing the impact and friction sensitivity of the mix. Boron carbide having particle sizes of about 1 m to about 7 m are recommended for the compositions described herein as larger particle sizes are too sensitive to safely handle. In studies with coarse boron carbide 12 40 micron particle size frequent initiations during the pressing operation of the test formulations into the M42 primer cups were observed. Reducing the particle size of the boron carbide to a more medium particle size 7 20 microns reduced the frequency of these unwanted initiations but not to a safety acceptable level. Employing a fine particle size of boron carbide 1 7 microns removed this issue allowing for the consistent pressing of primer formulations into the M42 primer cups without incident as indicated in Table ill below.

Additionally metal fuels including but not limited to magnesium magnalium titanium zirconium silicon phosphorus sulfur boron and compounds thereof and oxidizers including but not limited to metal oxides metal peroxides metal nitrates metal nitrites metal iodates metal periodates metal oxides metal phosphides and metal sulfides can be included as the pyrotechnic portion of the primer mix.

In still another embodiment tetrazene can be left out completely and substituted with an additional coarse particle boron carbide ground glass or another abrasive in order to render a high temperature resistant primer formulation.
