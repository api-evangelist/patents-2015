Solubility influences the oral absorption of pharmaceuticals. Drugs with poor dissolution rates are associated with low and variable bioavailability higher potential for food effects and Inability to deliver high doses for toxicity studies and difficulty in developing parenteral formulations. Therefore increasing the solubility of compounds may alleviate these risks associated with low solubility and moreover constitute an advantage.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts which are useful as selective inhibitors of one or more than one anti apoptotic protein family member the compounds having Formula I II or III

Compounds of this invention may contain carbon carbon double bonds or carbon nitrogen double bonds in the E or Z configuration wherein the term E represents higher order substituents on opposite sides of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond and the term Z represents higher order substituents on the same side of the carbon carbon or carbon nitrogen double bond as determined by the Cahn Ingold Prelog Priority Rules. The compounds of this invention may also exist as a mixture of E and Z isomers. Substituents around a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl are designated as being of cis or trans configuration. Furthermore the invention contemplates the various isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the disposal of substituents around an adamantane ring system. Two substituents around a single ring within an adamantane ring system are designated as being of Z or E relative configuration. For examples see C. D. Jones M. Kaselj R. N. Salvatore W. J. le Noble 1998 63 2758 2760 and E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen 1994 New York N.Y. Joint Wiley Sons Inc.

Compounds of this invention contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms in the R or S configuration in which the terms R and S are as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E Fundamental Stereochemistry Pure Appl. Chem. 1976 45 13 10. Compounds having asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms with equal amounts of R and S configurations are racemic at those carbon atoms. Atoms with an excess of one configuration over the other are assigned the configuration present in the higher amount preferably an excess of about 85 90 more preferably an excess of about 95 99 and still more preferably an excess greater than about 99 . Accordingly this invention includes racemic mixtures relative and absolute stereoisomers and mixtures of relative and absolute stereoisomers.

Compounds of this invention containing NH C O OH OH or SH moieties may have attached thereto prodrug forming moieties. The prodrug forming moieties are removed by metabolic processes and release the compounds having the freed hydroxyl amino or carboxylic acid in vivo. Prodrugs are useful for adjusting such pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds as solubility and or hydrophobicity absorption in the gastrointestinal tract bioavailability tissue penetration and rate of clearance.

Compounds of the invention can exist in isotope labeled or enriched form containing one or more atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most abundantly found in nature. Isotopes can be radioactive or non radioactive isotopes. Isotopes of atoms such as hydrogen carbon phosphorous sulfur fluorine chlorine and iodine include but are not limited to H H C C N O P S F Cl and I. Compounds that contain other isotopes of these and or other atoms are within the scope of this invention.

In another embodiment the isotope labeled compounds contain deuterium H tritium H or C isotopes. Isotope labeled compounds of this invention can be prepared by the general methods well known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. Such isotope labeled compounds can be conveniently prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples disclosed herein and Schemes by substituting a readily available isotope labeled reagent for a non labeled reagent. In some instances compounds may be treated with isotope labeled reagents to exchange a normal atom with its isotope for example hydrogen for deuterium can be exchanged by the action of a deuteric acid such as DSO DO. In addition to the above relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed for instance in Lizondo J et al. 21 11 1116 1996 Brickner S J et al. 39 3 673 1996 Mallesham B et al. 5 7 963 2003 PCT publications WO1997010223 WO2005099353 WO1995007271 WO2006008754 U.S. Pat.

The isotope labeled compounds of the invention may be used as standards to determine the effectiveness of Bcl 2 inhibitors in binding assays. Isotope containing compounds have been used in pharmaceutical research to investigate the in vivo metabolic fate of the compounds by evaluation of the mechanism of action and metabolic pathway of the nonisotope labeled parent compound Blake et al. 64 3 367 391 1975 . Such metabolic studies are important in the design of safe effective therapeutic drugs either because the in vivo active compound administered to the patient or because the metabolites produced from the parent compound prove to be toxic or carcinogenic Foster et al. Advances in Drug Research Vol. 14 pp. 2 36 Academic press London 1985 Kato et al. J. 36 10 927 932 1995 Kushner et al. 77 79 88 1999 .

In addition non radio active isotope containing drugs such as deuterated drugs called heavy drugs can be used for the treatment of diseases and conditions related to Bcl 2 activity. Increasing the amount of an isotope present in a compound above its natural abundance is called enrichment. Examples of the amount of enrichment include from about 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 16 21 25 29 33 37 42 46 50 54 58 63 67 71 75 79 84 88 92 96 to about 100 mol . Replacement of up to about 15 of normal atom with a heavy isotope has been effected and maintained for a period of days to weeks in mammals including rodents and dogs with minimal observed adverse effects Czajka D M and Finkel A J Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1960 84 770 Thomson J F Ann. New York Acad. Sci 1960 84 736 Czakja D M et al. Am. J. Physiol. 1961 201 357 . Acute replacement of as high as 15 23 in human fluids with deuterium was found not to cause toxicity Blagojevic N et al. in Dosimetry Treatment Planning for Neutron Capture Therapy Zamenhof R Solares G and Harling O Eds. 1994. Advanced Medical Publishing Madison Wis. pp. 125 134 Diabetes Metab. 23 251 1997 .

Stable isotope labeling of a drug can alter its physico chemical properties such as pKa and lipid solubility. These effects and alterations can affect the pharmacodynamic response of the drug molecule if the isotopic substitution affects a region involved in a ligand receptor interaction. While some of the physical properties of a stable isotope labeled molecule are different from those of the unlabeled one the chemical and biological properties are the same with one important exception because of the increased mass of the heavy isotope any bond involving the heavy isotope and another atom will be stronger than the same bond between the light isotope and that atom. Accordingly the incorporation of an isotope at a site of metabolism or enzymatic transformation will slow said reactions potentially altering the pharmcokinetic profile or efficacy relative to the non istopic compound.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds or therapeutically acceptable salts which are useful as selective inhibitors of one or more than one anti apoptoic protein family member the compounds having Formula I II or III

BiTE antibodies are bi specific antibodies that direct T cells to attack cancer cells by simultaneously binding the two cells. The T cell then attacks the target cancer cell. Examples of BiTE antibodies include adecatumumab Micromet MT201 blinatumomab Micromet MT103 and the like. Without being limited by theory one of the mechanisms by which T cells elicit apoptosis of the target cancer cell is by exocytosis of cytolytic granule components which include perforin and granzyme B. In this regard Bcl 2 has been shown to attenuate the induction of apoptosis by both perforin and granzyme B. These data suggest that inhibition of Bcl 2 could enhance the cytotoxic effects elicited by T cells when targeted to cancer cells V. R. Sutton D. L. Vaux and J. A. Trapani 1997 158 12 5783 .

SiRNAs are molecules having endogenous RNA bases or chemically modified nucleotides. The modifications do not abolish cellular activity but rather impart increased stability and or increased cellular potency. Examples of chemical modifications include phosphorothioate groups 2 deoxynucleotide 2 OCH containing ribonucleotides 2 F ribonucleotides 2 methoxyethyl ribonucleotides combinations thereof and the like. The siRNA can have varying lengths e.g. 10 200 bps and structures e.g. hairpins single double strands bulges nicks gaps mismatches and are processed in cells to provide active gene silencing. A double stranded siRNA dsRNA can have the same number of nucleotides on each strand blunt ends or asymmetric ends overhangs . The overhang of 1 2 nucleotides can be present on the sense and or the antisense strand as well as present on the 5 and or the 3 ends of a given strand. For example siRNAs targeting Mcl 1 have been shown to enhance the activity of ABT 263 i.e. N 4 4 2 4 chlorophenyl 5 5 dimethyl 1 cyclohex 1 en 1 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 morpholin 4 yl 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 trifluoromethyl sulfonyl benzenesulfonamide or ABT 737 i.e. N 4 4 4 chloro 1 1 biphenyl 2 yl methyl piperazin 1 yl benzoyl 4 1R 3 dimethylamino 1 phenylsulfanyl methyl propyl amino 3 nitrobenzenesulfonamide in multiple tumor cell lines Tse et. al 2008 68 9 3421 and references therein .

Multivalent binding proteins are binding proteins comprising two or more antigen binding sites. Multivalent binding proteins are engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites and are generally not naturally occurring antibodies. The term multispecific binding protein means a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain DVD binding proteins are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins binding proteins comprising two or mere antigen binding sites. Such DVDs may be monospecific i.e. capable of binding one antigen or multispecific i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens . DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD Ig s. Each half of a DVD Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide a light chain DVD polypeptide and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. Multispecific DVDs include DVD binding proteins that bind DLL4 and VEGF or C met and EFGR or ErbB3 and EGFR.

Electrospray mass spectra ESI MS were recorded on Finnigan SSQ7000 Finnigan Corp. San Jose Calif. in both positive and negative ion mode.

Peptides were synthesized with at most 250 mol preloaded Wang resin vessel on an ABI 433A peptide synthesiser using 250 mol scale Fastmoc coupling cycles. Preloaded cartridges containing 1 mmol standard Fmoc amino acids except for the position of attachment of the fluorophore where 1 mmol Fmoc Lys Mtt OH was placed in the cartridge were used with conductivity feedback monitoring N terminal acetylation was accomplished by using 1 mmol acetic acid in a cartridge under standard coupling conditions.

The resin from the synthesizer was washed thrice with dichloromethane and kept wet 150 mL of 95 4 1 dichloromethane triisopropylsilane trifluoroacetic acid was flowed through the resin bed over 30 minutes. The mixture turned deep yellow then faded to pale yellow. 100 mL of N N dimethylformamide was flowed through the bed over 15 minutes. The resin was then washed thrice with N N dimethylformamide and filtered. Ninhydrin tests showed a strong signal for primary amine.

The resin was treated with 2 equivalents 6 FAM NHS in 1 DIEA N N dimethylformamide and stirred or shaken at ambient temperature overnight. When complete the resin was drained washed thrice with N N dimethylformamide thrice with 1 DCM and 1 methanol and dried to provide an orange resin that was negative by ninhydrin test.

Peptides were cleaved from the resin by shaking for 3 hours at ambient temperature in a cleavage cocktail consisting of 80 TFA 5 water 5 thioanisole 5 phenol 2.5 TIS and 2.5 EDT 1 mL 0.1 g resin . The resin was removed by filtration and rinsing twice with TFA. The TFA was evaporated from the filtrates and product was precipitated with ether 10 mL 0.1 g resin recovered by centrifugation washed twice with ether 10 mL 0.1 g resin and dried to give the crude peptide.

The crude peptides were purified on a Gilson preparative HPLC system running Unipoint analysis software Gilson Inc.

Analytical HPLC was performed on a Hewlett Packard 1200 series system with a diode array detector and a Hewlett Packard 1046A fluorescence detector running HPLC 3D CHEMSTATION software version A.03.04 Hewlett Packard. Palo Alto Calif. on a 4.6 250 mm YMC column packed with ODS AQ 5 m particles with a 120 pore size and eluted with one of the gradient methods listed below after preequilibrating at the starting conditions for 7 minutes. Eluents were buffer A 0.1 TFA water and buffer B acetonitrile. The flow rate for all gradients was 1 mL min.

Fmoc Rink amide MBHA resin was extended rising the general peptide synthesis procedure to provide the protected resin bound peptide 1.020 g . The Mtt group was removed labeled with 6 FAM NHS and cleaved and deprotected as described hereinabove to provide the crude product as an orange solid 0.37 g . This product was purified by RP HPLC. Fractions across the main peak were tested by analytical RP HPLC and the pure fractions were isolated and lyophilized with the major peak providing the title compound 0.0802 g as a yellow solid MALDI MS m z 2137.1 M H .

The protected peptide was assembled on 0.25 mmol Fmoc Rink amide MBHA resin Novabiochem on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated peptide synthesizer running FASTMOC coupling cycles using pre loaded 1 mmol amino acid cartridges except for the fluorescein 6 FAM labeled lysine where 1 mmol Fmoc Lys 4 methyltrityl was weighed into the cartridge. The N terminal acetyl group was incorporated by putting 1 mmol acetic acid in a cartridge and coupling as described hereinabove. Selective removal of the 4 methyltrityl group was accomplished with a solution of 95 4 1 DCM TIS TFA v v v flowed through the resin over 15 minutes followed by quenching with a flow of dimethylformamide. Single isomer 6 carboxyfluorescein NHS was reacted with the lysine side chain in 1 DIEA in N N dimethylformamide and confirmed complete by ninhydrin testing. The peptide was cleaved from the resin and side chains deprotected by treating with 80 5 5 5 2.5 2.5 TFA water phenol thioanisole triisopropylsilane 3 6 dioxa 1 8 octanedithiol v v v v v v and the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with diethyl ether. The crude peptide was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and its purity and identity were confirmed by analytical reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and matrix assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry m z 2137.1 M H .

Representative compounds were serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO starting at 50 M 2 starting concentration 10 DMSO and 10 L were transferred into a 384 well plate. Then 10 L of a protein probe antibody mix was added to each well at final concentrations listed in TABLE 1. The samples are then mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated for an additional 3 hours at room temperature. For each assay the probe antibody and protein probe antibody were included on each assay plate as negative and positive controls respectively. Fluorescence was measured on the ENVISION plate reader Perkin Elmer using a 340 35 nm excitation filter and 520 525 F Bak peptide and 495 510 nm Tb labeled anti Histidine antibody emission filters. Inhibition constants Ki are shown in TABLE 2 below and were determined using Wang s equation Wang Z. X. An Exact Mathematical Expression For Describing Competitive Binding Of Two Different Ligands To A Protein Molecule. 1995 360 111 4 .

Inhibition constants K for compounds according to the invention are shown in TABLE 2 below. Where the Kfor a compound is represented as greater than a certain numerical value it is intended to mean that the binding affinity value is greater than the limits of detection of the assay used. Where the Kfor a compound is represented as 

The inhibition constant K is the dissociation constant of an enzyme inhibitor complex or a protein small molecule complex wherein the small molecule is inhibiting binding of one protein to another protein. So a large Kvalue indicates a low binding affinity and a small Kvalue indicates a high binding affinity.

The data in TABLE 2 shows inhibition constants for the inhibition of a Bak BH3 peptide probe to Bcl 2 protein and indicate that compounds according to the invention have high binding affinities for anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein. The compounds are therefore expected to have utility in treatment of diseases during which anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein is expressed.

The acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cell line RS4 11 was used as the primary human cell line to assess the cellular activity of Bcl 2 selective agents in vitro and their efficacy in vivo. Previous studies have shown by BH3 profiling a mitochondrial assay that classifies blocks in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway that RS4 11 cells were highly dependant on BCL 2 for survival and sensitive to the Bcl 2 family member inhibitor ABT 737 Blood 2008 Vol. III 2300 2309 . The prevalence of Bcl 2 complexed to the proapoptotic BH3 protein Bim in RS4 11 suggests that these cells are primed or more susceptible to cell death by antagonism of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl 2 for which they depend on for survival.

RS4 11 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L glutamine 10 FBS 1 mM sodium pyruvate 2 mM HEPES 1 penicillin streptomycin Invitrogen 4.5 g L glucose and maintained at 37 C containing 5 CO. To test for the cellular activity of compounds in vitro cells were treated at 50 000 cells per well in 96 well microliter plates in the presence of 10 human serum for 48 hours in a humidified chamber with 5 CO. Cell cytotoxicity ECvalues were assessed using CellTiter Glo Promega according to the manufacturers recommendations. The ECvalues were determined as a percentage of viable cells following treatment compared to the untreated control cells.

TABLE 3 shows the utility of compounds having Formula 1 to functionally inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein in a cellular context. The acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL cell line RS4 11 has been shown by BH3 profiling a mitochondrial assay that classifies blocks in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to be highly dependant on Bcl 2 for survival and is sensitive to the Bcl 2 family member inhibitor ABT 737 2008 Vol. 111 2300 2309 . The ability of compounds to kill RS4 11 cells is a direct measure of the compounds ability to inhibit anti apoptotic Bcl 2 protein function. Compounds of Formula I are very effective in killing RS4 11 cells as demonstrated by low ECvalues.

The neutral form of compounds are generally and considerably more permeable than the charged form Chakrabarti A. C Clark Lewis I. Harrigan P. R. Cullis P. R. 1992 61 228 234 . Furthermore the presence of a charged residue can result in a permeability rate of up to 10times slower than that observed for the corresponding neutral species Ellens H. Eddy E. P. Lee C. Dougherty P. Lago A. Xiang J. Elliot J. D. Cheng H. Ohlstein E. Smith P. 1997 23 99 109 . Compounds of this invention contain a phosphate group which is expected to be negatively charged at physiological pH in addition to an acylsufonamide moiety which is also expected to be negatively changed at physiological pH. It is therefore expected that compounds of the invention which contain multiple negative charges at physiological pH would not be able to penetrate the cell membrane of RS4 11 cells and induce apoptosis or programmed cell death. As demonstrated in Table 3 compounds of this invention are unexpectedly capable of penetrating the cell membrane and inducing programmed cell death.
