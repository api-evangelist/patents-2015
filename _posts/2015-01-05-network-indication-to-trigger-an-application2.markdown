This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 926 906 entitled NETWORK INDICATION TO TRIGGER AN APPLICATION and filed on Jan. 13 2014 which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to an enhancement related to a wireless emergency alert WEA system. More specifically the present disclosure relates to an indication provided by a network to trigger an application.

Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various telecommunication services such as telephony video data messaging and broadcasts. Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources e.g. bandwidth transmit power . Examples of such multiple access technologies include code division multiple access CDMA systems time division multiple access TDMA systems frequency division multiple access FDMA systems orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA systems single carrier frequency division multiple access SC FDMA systems and time division synchronous code division multiple access TD SCDMA systems.

These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal national regional and even global level. An example of an emerging telecommunication standard is Long Term Evolution LTE . LTE is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS mobile standard promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP . LTE is designed to better support mobile broadband Internet access by improving spectral efficiency lowering costs improving services making use of new spectrum and better integrating with other open standards using OFDMA on the downlink DL SC FDMA on the uplink UL and multiple input multiple output MIMO antenna technology. However as the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase there exists a need for further improvements in LTE technology. Preferably these improvements should be applicable to other multi access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.

In an aspect of the disclosure a method a computer program product and an apparatus are provided. The apparatus may be a user equipment UE . The UE receives system information including a trigger message and additional information. In addition the UE enables an application and provides the additional information to the application based on the trigger message.

The detailed description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.

Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks modules components circuits steps processes algorithms etc. collectively referred to as elements . These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware computer software or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.

By way of example an element or any portion of an element or any combination of elements may be implemented with a processing system that includes one or more processors. Examples of processors include microprocessors microcontrollers digital signal processors DSPs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs programmable logic devices PLDs state machines gated logic discrete hardware circuits and other suitable hardware configured to perform the various functionality described throughout this disclosure. One or more processors in the processing system may execute software. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions instruction sets code code segments program code programs subprograms software modules applications software applications software packages routines subroutines objects executables threads of execution procedures functions etc. whether referred to as software firmware middleware microcode hardware description language or otherwise.

Accordingly in one or more exemplary embodiments the functions described may be implemented in hardware software firmware or any combination thereof. If implemented in software the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable medium. Computer readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example and not limitation such computer readable media can comprise a random access memory RAM a read only memory ROM an electrically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM compact disk ROM CD ROM or other optical disk storage magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices or any other medium that can be used to carry or store desired program code in the form of instructions or data structures and that can be accessed by a computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer readable media.

The E UTRAN includes the evolved Node B eNB and other eNBs and may include a Multicast Coordination Entity MCE . The eNB provides user and control planes protocol terminations toward the UE . The eNB may be connected to the other eNBs via a backhaul e.g. an X2 interface . The MCE allocates time frequency radio resources for evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service MBMS eMBMS and determines the radio configuration e.g. a modulation and coding scheme MCS for the eMBMS. The MCE may be a separate entity or part of the eNB . The eNB may also be referred to as a base station a Node B an access point a base transceiver station a radio base station a radio transceiver a transceiver function a basic service set BSS an extended service set ESS or some other suitable terminology. The eNB provides an access point to the EPC for a UE . Examples of UEs include a cellular phone a smart phone a session initiation protocol SIP phone a laptop a personal digital assistant PDA a satellite radio a global positioning system a multimedia device a video device a digital audio player e.g. MP3 player a camera a game console a tablet or any other similar functioning device. The UE may also be referred to by those skilled in the art as a mobile station a subscriber station a mobile unit a subscriber unit a wireless unit a remote unit a mobile device a wireless device a wireless communications device a remote device a mobile subscriber station an access terminal a mobile terminal a wireless terminal a remote terminal a handset a user agent a mobile client a client or some other suitable terminology.

The eNB is connected to the EPC . The EPC may include a Mobility Management Entity MME a Home Subscriber Server HSS other MMEs a Serving Gateway a Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service MBMS Gateway a Broadcast Multicast Service Center BM SC and a Packet Data Network PDN Gateway . The MME is the control node that processes the signaling between the UE and the EPC . Generally the MME provides bearer and connection management. All user IP packets are transferred through the Serving Gateway which itself is connected to the PDN Gateway . The PDN Gateway provides UE IP address allocation as well as other functions. The PDN Gateway and the BM SC are connected to the IP Services . The IP Services may include the Internet an intranet an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS a PS Streaming Service PSS and or other IP services. The BM SC may provide functions for MBMS user service provisioning and delivery. The BM SC may serve as an entry point for content provider MBMS transmission may be used to authorize and initiate MBMS Bearer Services within a PLMN and may be used to schedule and deliver MBMS transmissions. The MBMS Gateway may be used to distribute MBMS traffic to the eNBs e.g. belonging to a Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network MBSFN area broadcasting a particular service and may be responsible for session management start stop and for collecting eMBMS related charging information.

The modulation and multiple access scheme employed by the access network may vary depending on the particular telecommunications standard being deployed. In LTE applications OFDM is used on the DL and SC FDMA is used on the UL to support both frequency division duplex FDD and time division duplex TDD . As those skilled in the art will readily appreciate from the detailed description to follow the various concepts presented herein are well suited for LTE applications. However these concepts may be readily extended to other telecommunication standards employing other modulation and multiple access techniques. By way of example these concepts may be extended to Evolution Data Optimized EV DO or Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB . EV DO and UMB are air interface standards promulgated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 as part of the CDMA2000 family of standards and employs CDMA to provide broadband Internet access to mobile stations. These concepts may also be extended to Universal Terrestrial Radio Access UTRA employing Wideband CDMA W CDMA and other variants of CDMA such as TD SCDMA Global System for Mobile Communications GSM employing TDMA and Evolved UTRA E UTRA IEEE 802.11 Wi Fi IEEE 802.16 WiMAX IEEE 802.20 and Flash OFDM employing OFDMA. UTRA E UTRA UMTS LTE and GSM are described in documents from the 3GPP organization. CDMA2000 and UMB are described in documents from the 3GPP2 organization. The actual wireless communication standard and the multiple access technology employed will depend on the specific application and the overall design constraints imposed on the system.

The eNBs may have multiple antennas supporting MIMO technology. The use of MIMO technology enables the eNBs to exploit the spatial domain to support spatial multiplexing beamforming and transmit diversity. Spatial multiplexing may be used to transmit different streams of data simultaneously on the same frequency. The data streams may be transmitted to a single UE to increase the data rate or to multiple UEs to increase the overall system capacity. This is achieved by spatially precoding each data stream i.e. applying a scaling of an amplitude and a phase and then transmitting each spatially precoded stream through multiple transmit antennas on the DL. The spatially precoded data streams arrive at the UE s with different spatial signatures which enables each of the UE s to recover the one or more data streams destined for that UE . On the UL each UE transmits a spatially precoded data stream which enables the eNB to identify the source of each spatially precoded data stream.

Spatial multiplexing is generally used when channel conditions are good. When channel conditions are less favorable beamforming may be used to focus the transmission energy in one or more directions. This may be achieved by spatially precoding the data for transmission through multiple antennas. To achieve good coverage at the edges of the cell a single stream beamforming transmission may be used in combination with transmit diversity.

In the detailed description that follows various aspects of an access network will be described with reference to a MIMO system supporting OFDM on the DL. OFDM is a spread spectrum technique that modulates data over a number of subcarriers within an OFDM symbol. The subcarriers are spaced apart at precise frequencies. The spacing provides orthogonality that enables a receiver to recover the data from the subcarriers. In the time domain a guard interval e.g. cyclic prefix may be added to each OFDM symbol to combat inter OFDM symbol interference. The UL may use SC FDMA in the form of a DFT spread OFDM signal to compensate for high peak to average power ratio PAPR .

A UE may be assigned resource blocks in the control section to transmit control information to an eNB. The UE may also be assigned resource blocks in the data section to transmit data to the eNB. The UE may transmit control information in a physical UL control channel PUCCH on the assigned resource blocks in the control section. The UE may transmit data or both data and control information in a physical UL shared channel PUSCH on the assigned resource blocks in the data section. A UL transmission may span both slots of a subframe and may hop across frequency.

A set of resource blocks may be used to perform initial system access and achieve UL synchronization in a physical random access channel PRACH . The PRACH carries a random sequence and cannot carry any UL data signaling. Each random access preamble occupies a bandwidth corresponding to six consecutive resource blocks. The starting frequency is specified by the network. That is the transmission of the random access preamble is restricted to certain time and frequency resources. There is no frequency hopping for the PRACH. The PRACH attempt is carried in a single subframe 1 ms or in a sequence of few contiguous subframes and a UE can make a single PRACH attempt per frame 10 ms .

In the user plane the L2 layer includes a media access control MAC sublayer a radio link control RLC sublayer and a packet data convergence protocol PDCP sublayer which are terminated at the eNB on the network side. Although not shown the UE may have several upper layers above the L2 layer including a network layer e.g. IP layer that is terminated at the PDN gateway on the network side and an application layer that is terminated at the other end of the connection e.g. far end UE server etc. .

The PDCP sublayer provides multiplexing between different radio bearers and logical channels. The PDCP sublayer also provides header compression for upper layer data packets to reduce radio transmission overhead security by ciphering the data packets and handover support for UEs between eNBs. The RLC sublayer provides segmentation and reassembly of upper layer data packets retransmission of lost data packets and reordering of data packets to compensate for out of order reception due to hybrid automatic repeat request HARQ . The MAC sublayer provides multiplexing between logical and transport channels. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for allocating the various radio resources e.g. resource blocks in one cell among the UEs. The MAC sublayer is also responsible for HARQ operations.

In the control plane the radio protocol architecture for the UE and eNB is substantially the same for the physical layer and the L2 layer with the exception that there is no header compression function for the control plane. The control plane also includes a radio resource control RRC sublayer in Layer 3 L3 layer . The RRC sublayer is responsible for obtaining radio resources e.g. radio bearers and for configuring the lower layers using RRC signaling between the eNB and the UE.

The transmit TX processor implements various signal processing functions for the L1 layer i.e. physical layer . The signal processing functions include coding and interleaving to facilitate forward error correction FEC at the UE and mapping to signal constellations based on various modulation schemes e.g. binary phase shift keying BPSK quadrature phase shift keying QPSK M phase shift keying M PSK M quadrature amplitude modulation M QAM . The coded and modulated symbols are then split into parallel streams. Each stream is then mapped to an OFDM subcarrier multiplexed with a reference signal e.g. pilot in the time and or frequency domain and then combined together using an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform IFFT to produce a physical channel carrying a time domain OFDM symbol stream. The OFDM stream is spatially precoded to produce multiple spatial streams. Channel estimates from a channel estimator may be used to determine the coding and modulation scheme as well as for spatial processing. The channel estimate may be derived from a reference signal and or channel condition feedback transmitted by the UE . Each spatial stream may then be provided to a different antenna via a separate transmitter TX. Each transmitter TX may modulate an RF carrier with a respective spatial stream for transmission.

At the UE each receiver RX receives a signal through its respective antenna . Each receiver RX recovers information modulated onto an RF carrier and provides the information to the receive RX processor . The RX processor implements various signal processing functions of the L1 layer. The RX processor may perform spatial processing on the information to recover any spatial streams destined for the UE . If multiple spatial streams are destined for the UE they may be combined by the RX processor into a single OFDM symbol stream. The RX processor then converts the OFDM symbol stream from the time domain to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform FFT . The frequency domain signal comprises a separate OFDM symbol stream for each subcarrier of the OFDM signal. The symbols on each subcarrier and the reference signal are recovered and demodulated by determining the most likely signal constellation points transmitted by the eNB . These soft decisions may be based on channel estimates computed by the channel estimator . The soft decisions are then decoded and deinterleaved to recover the data and control signals that were originally transmitted by the eNB on the physical channel. The data and control signals are then provided to the controller processor .

The controller processor implements the L2 layer. The controller processor can be associated with a memory that stores program codes and data. The memory may be referred to as a computer readable medium. In the UL the controller processor provides demultiplexing between transport and logical channels packet reassembly deciphering header decompression control signal processing to recover upper layer packets from the core network. The upper layer packets are then provided to a data sink which represents all the protocol layers above the L2 layer. Various control signals may also be provided to the data sink for L3 processing. The controller processor is also responsible for error detection using an acknowledgement ACK and or negative acknowledgement NACK protocol to support HARQ operations.

In the UL a data source is used to provide upper layer packets to the controller processor . The data source represents all protocol layers above the L2 layer. Similar to the functionality described in connection with the DL transmission by the eNB the controller processor implements the L2 layer for the user plane and the control plane by providing header compression ciphering packet segmentation and reordering and multiplexing between logical and transport channels based on radio resource allocations by the eNB . The controller processor is also responsible for HARQ operations retransmission of lost packets and signaling to the eNB .

Channel estimates derived by a channel estimator from a reference signal or feedback transmitted by the eNB may be used by the TX processor to select the appropriate coding and modulation schemes and to facilitate spatial processing. The spatial streams generated by the TX processor may be provided to different antenna via separate transmitters TX. Each transmitter TX may modulate an RF carrier with a respective spatial stream for transmission.

The UL transmission is processed at the eNB in a manner similar to that described in connection with the receiver function at the UE . Each receiver RX receives a signal through its respective antenna . Each receiver RX recovers information modulated onto an RF carrier and provides the information to a RX processor . The RX processor may implement the L1 layer.

The controller processor implements the L2 layer. The controller processor can be associated with a memory that stores program codes and data. The memory may be referred to as a computer readable medium. In the UL the controller processor provides demultiplexing between transport and logical channels packet reassembly deciphering header decompression control signal processing to recover upper layer packets from the UE . Upper layer packets from the controller processor may be provided to the core network. The controller processor is also responsible for error detection using an ACK and or NACK protocol to support HARQ operations.

By way of background U.S. law currently requires commercial mobile service providers CMSPs sometimes referred to herein as providers to elect between transmitting and not transmitting alert messages. A provider that elects not to transmit alert messages must notify its subscribers of its election not to transmit alert messages as well as to provide notification about its election not to transmit alert messages at the point of sale. Many providers have already elected to transmit alert messages to their subscribers. A provider that elects to transmit alert messages must comply with applicable standards protocols and or procedures. Standards protocols and or procedures may be provided by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions ATIS Telecommunications Industry Association TIA and or joint ATIS TIA groups. An example of a related standard is Joint ATIS TIA Commercial Mobile Alert System CMAS Federal Alert Gateway to CMSP Gateway Interface Specification J STD 101 . A provider that elects to transmit alert messages must also comply with federal regulations e.g. regulations adopted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission FCC . Government collaboration with the WEA system is provided by the FCC Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA and Department of Homeland Security DHS .

As illustrated in alert messages may originate from federal agencies local emergency operations centers EOCs and state EOCs . Alert messages may also originate from other sources not illustrated in without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure. An alert message may be triggered by various types of emergencies such as an earthquake a tsunami a flood a tornado a wildfire an act of terrorism and or child abduction e.g. an AMBER alert . Alert messages originating from various sources e.g. federal agencies local EOCs and state EOCs are provided to an alert aggregator . In some configurations the alert aggregator may authenticate the alert messages. Authentication may involve checking the authenticity of the alert message to confirm that the alert message was transmitted by an authorized source e.g. a federal agency a local EOC or a state EOC in order to prevent unauthorized sources e.g. terrorist hackers etc. from causing fraudulent alert messages to be disseminated to UEs using the WEA system. The alert aggregator may provide the alert messages to an alert gateway . The alert gateway may provide the alert messages to the providers i.e. CMSPs that have elected to transmit alert messages to their subscribers. In some configurations the alert aggregator and the alert gateway may be administered by a governmental entity e.g. a federal agency .

If a provider i.e. CMSP has elected to transmit alert messages the alert gateway may transmit the alert message to the CMSP gateway of that provider. The CMSP gateway may be configured to determine a severity of the alert message referred to as severity information as well as a geographic area associated with the emergency. For example the CMSP gateway may determine that an earthquake has high severity and the CMSP gateway may also determine that the geographic area associated with the emergency is a 10 mile radius with respect to the earthquake epicenter in downtown San Diego. Based on the information determined by the CMSP gateway the provider may utilize various components of its CMSP infrastructure to transmit the alert message to particular UEs . The CMSP infrastructure may include a cell broadcast entity CBE a cell broadcast center CBC a mobile management entity MME and or an eNB as will be described infra with reference to . Based on the severity information and the geographic area associated with the emergency the provider may utilize the eNBs located with the 10 mile radius of the earthquake epicenter in downtown San Diego to transmit the alert message to all UEs within that geographic area. Because the WEA system employs broadcast technology all of those UEs will receive the alert message at or nearly at the same time. Also because the geographic area affected by the emergency is limited to a 10 mile radius of downtown San Diego the provider would not transmit the alert message to UEs located outside of that geographic area.

An alert message application may run on the OS . The UE also has an alert message control module in communication with the alert message application the components of the OS the transmission module and the receiving module . In one configuration the alert message control module may be a component of the OS . In another configuration the alert message control module may be separate from but in communication with the OS . The alert message application is in an upper layer e.g. application layer relative to the alert message control module the receiving module and the transmission module which are in a lower layer e.g. OS layer .

As will be described infra the receiving module may receive via the receiver transmitter one or more alert messages carried by for example a Cell Broadcast Service CBS service of an eNB . The alert message control module subsequently obtains the one or more alert messages from the receiving module . In certain circumstances the alert message control module may process the alert messages and display the alert message content on the UE . In certain circumstances the alert message control module may send the alert message content to the alert message application which accordingly displays the alert message content on the UE .

In one configuration the CBE e.g. an information source sends alert emergency information e.g. warning type warning message impacted area time period to the CBC. For example the alert information may be regarding an earthquake in San Diego.

Using the impacted area information the CBC identifies which MMEs need to be contacted. In this example the impacted area information may specify a geographic area of a 10 mile radius of downtown San Diego. Accordingly the CBC can identify the MMEs that manage the cells in the specified geographic area of the 10 mile radius of downtown San Diego.

Further the CBC prepares one or more alert messages to carry the alert information. In this example the CBC prepares two alert messages i.e. the first alert message and the second alert message regarding the earthquake in San Diego. Particularly the first alert message may include a serial number a Message Identifier MID and alert message content . The second alert message may include a serial number an MID and alert message content . The serial number may be unique to the first alert message e.g. the serial number is different from the serial number . A serial number identifies a particular alert message from the source and type indicated by an MID and may be altered every time the alert message with a given MID is changed. An MID identifies the source and type of the alert message. For example the California Earthquake Authority which is the source and Earthquake Warning which is the type may correspond to one value. A number of alert messages may originate from the same source and or may be of the same type. These alert messages may be distinguished by the serial numbers. The MID and the MID each may be a numeric value. The CBC may set the numeric value as one of a predetermined set of MIDs such as the MIDs defined in 3Generation Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Core Network and Terminals Technical realization of Cell Broadcast Service CBS Release 12 3GPP TS 23.041 V12.4.0 2013 12 . Particularly the predetermined set of MIDs may be MIDs in the range of 4370 4382. An MID equal to 4370 may correspond to a presidential alert which is an alert issued by the President of the United States. As another example an MID equal to 4379 may correspond to child abduction e.g. an AMBER alert . In this example the MID is set to be one of the predetermined set of MIDs. The MID is set to a value not in the predetermined set of MIDs.

The CBC also constructs one or more alert requests each including an alert message and associated delivery attributes such as MID Serial Number Tracking Area ID TAI list Warning Area Operation and Maintenance Centre OMC ID Concurrent Warning Message CWM Indicator Send Write Replace Warning Indication and Global eNB ID. The CBC then sends the one or more alert requests to the selected MMEs.

After receiving the alert requests an MME may select based on the TAI ID list attribute which eNodeBs to forward the alert requests to. Then the MME forwards the alert requests to the selected eNodeBs which includes the eNB in this example.

The eNB or other selected eNBs may be configured with the TAI s and Cell ID s it serves and the Emergency Area ID s that it belongs to. The Warning Area attribute in an alert request may be a list of Cell IDs a list of TAIs or one or more Emergency Area IDs. After receiving the alert requests the eNB checks for any match of the contents of the Warning Area attribute with these IDs to identify the cells where to distribute the alert messages. The eNB then obtains the one or more alert messages from the one or more alert requests and broadcasts the alert messages e.g. the first alert message and the second alert message to the UEs which includes the UE in this example in the selected cells. The eNB may send to the UE one or more alert messages e.g. the first alert message and the second alert message in one or more system information blocks SIBs e.g. of system information block type SIB on PDSCH. Thus the first alert message and the second alert message are system information.

The receiving module of the UE receives the broadcast alert messages through the receiver transmitter . The receiving module forwards the alert messages to the alert message control module . The alert message control module is configurable by a user or by another program to ignore certain alert messages based on the MIDs of the alert messages. Therefore the UE displays the content of the alert messages having MIDs from a collection of predetermined MIDs the UE refrains from displaying the content of the alert messages having other MIDs. For example with respect to the first alert message the alert message control module may be configured to extract and determine the value of the MID and only to process the first alert message when the MID is equal to one of one or more predetermined values e.g. 4370 which indicates that the alert is a presidential alert . The alert message control module is configured to ignore or to discard the first alert message when the MID has other values e.g. 4379 which corresponds to child abduction i.e. an AMBER alert . Thus the UE refrains from displaying the alert message content when the first alert message has an MID that is not one of the predetermined values.

Legacy systems of UEs may be configured to only recognize the MIDs from the predetermined set of MIDs. In other words in this example when a legacy system of a UE receives the first alert message which has an MID from the predetermined set e.g. in the range of 4370 4382 the legacy system recognizes the MID and displays the alert message content on the UE. When a legacy system receives the second alert message which does not have an MID from the predetermined set the legacy system does not recognize the MID and discards the second alert message . For instance when the MID of the second alert message is equal to 4396 a legacy system ignores the second alert message .

With respect to the UE the alert message control module is configured to process the alert messages having MIDs from the predetermined set. For example the alert message control module may extract the alert message content from the first alert message and then display the alert message content on the UE .

In addition the system of the UE is an improved system and the alert message control module is configured to recognize the MIDs not in the predetermined set. In certain configurations those recognized MIDs not in the predetermined set may form another predetermined collection of MIDs. In other words the alert message control module is configured to recognize the MIDs in the predetermined set and MIDs in the predetermined collection. The alert message control module may discard alert messages having MIDs not in the predetermined set or the predetermined collection. In this example the first alert message having an MID from the predetermined set provides alert information with respect to an alert event and can be recognized by both legacy systems and improved systems e.g. the system of the UE . The second alert message having an MID not in the predetermined set but in the predetermined collection provides additional information e.g. the alert message content regarding the same alert event and can be recognized by the improved systems but are ignored by the legacy systems. Particularly the CBC may set the serial number of the second alert message to be in a predetermined relationship with e.g. to follow or to be the same as the serial number of the first alert message to indicate that the second alert message is associated with the first alert message and provides additional information regarding the alert event specified by the first alert message . In certain configurations the CBC may configure the first alert message and the second alert message to carry the alert information not associated with each other. For example the first alert message and the second alert message may represent two different alert events.

When the alert message control module of the UE receives the second alert message the alert message control module determines that the MID is not one of the predetermined set of MIDs. The alert message control module may instead of ignoring the second alert message as the legacy systems do send the alert message content of the second alert message to the alert message application . The alert message application may provide an application programming interface API through which the alert message control module can send the alert message content to the alert message application .

Specifically the alert message control module may consider the MID as a trigger message . In response to detecting the trigger message the alert message control module does not itself process the alert message content or display the alert message content . Rather the alert message control module extracts the alert message content and sends the alert message content to the alert message application for processing and display. In this example the alert message content may include location information .

More specifically in this example upon receiving the first alert message the alert message control module may display for example text based alert information on the UE . Upon receiving the second alert message the alert message control module determines that the alert message content of the second alert message is to be sent to the alert message application based on the MID . The alert message control module further determines that the second alert message is associated with the first alert message based on the serial numbers of the first alert message and the second alert message as described supra. After obtaining the location information from the second alert message the alert message control module may send the location information to the alert message application for display. Accordingly the alert message application displays map related information on the display of the UE based on the location information . The map related information may indicate the geographic area associated with the location information in the second alert message see . Also the map related information may indicate a geographic location of the UE . For example the map related information may indicate that the geographic area of an earthquake as well as the geographic location of the UE . The second alert message was provided to the UE because the UE is located in the geographic area of the earthquake. If the UE was located outside of the geographic area of the earthquake the second alert message as well as the first alert message may not have been provided to the UE . In certain configurations the alert message control module may send to the alert message application some alert information obtained from the first alert message . Thus the alert message application may display indications that the alert information displayed by the alert message application is associated with the alert information displayed by the alert message control module . In this example the first alert message may have information regarding the time at which an alert event e.g. an earthquake occurred. The alert message control module may send the time information to the alert message application along with the location information of the second alert message . Thus the alert message application may display the map related information as well as an indication that the map related information is for the alert event occurred at the time specified by the time information.

As described supra in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure the alert message control module does not ignore the second alert message because the MID is not one of the predetermined set of MIDs. Instead the alert message control module provides the location information of the second alert message to the alert message application . The alert message application presents the map related information on the display of the UE .

One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any MID that is different from the predetermined set of MIDs may be pre set pre selected pre determined or otherwise configured in the UE in accordance with various communication standards protocols and or procedures. For example an MID equal to 4396 may not be one of the predetermined set of MIDs e.g. in the range 4370 4382 . Nonetheless various communication standards protocols and or procedures may pre set pre select pre determine or otherwise standardize that an MID equal to 4396 corresponds to a particular type of information.

In some configurations the alert message control module determines to send the location information of the second alert message to the alert message application for displaying the map related information when the first alert message is received and the location information of the second alert message is associated with the first alert message .

As described supra in some configurations the first alert message includes an MID within a predetermined set of MIDs e.g. in the range 4370 4382 and the second alert message includes an MID e.g. 4396 different from the predetermined set of MIDs. In some configurations the serial number of the second alert message is greater than or equal to the serial number of the previous first alert message .

At operation alert information may be transmitted from the alert gateway to the CBE . For example the alert information may include general information regarding an earthquake as well as the location information of the earthquake in the example described supra. At operation in response to receiving the alert information the CBE may transmit an emergency broadcast request signal containing the alert information to the CBC . At operation in response to receiving the emergency broadcast request signal in one operation the CBC may transmit a write replace warning request signal containing e.g. the first alert message to the MME . In another operation the CBC may transmit another write replace warning request signal containing e.g. the second alert message to the MME . If the MME receives a write replace warning request signal at operation the MME may transmit a write replace warning confirm signal back to the CBC . At operation in response to receiving the write replace warning confirm signal the CBC may transmit an emergency broadcast response signal back to the CBE . At operation the MME may transmit a write replace warning request signal containing e.g. the first alert message or the second alert message to the eNB . At operation in response to receiving the write replace warning response signal the eNB may perform cell broadcast delivery.

During cell broadcast delivery the eNB may transmit an alert message e.g. the first alert message or the second alert message to the UE s located in a particular geographic area. As discussed supra the eNB may broadcast the alert message to only the UE s that are in a particular geographic area e.g. the geographic area associated with an emergency and may refrain from broadcasting the alert message to UE s that are outside of that particular geographic area. At operation the eNB may transmit a write replace warning response signal back to the MME . In some configurations operation and operation may be performed at or nearly at the same time. At operation in response to the cell broadcast delivery from the eNB to the UE s the UE s may provide user alerting. In some configurations user alerting may include a text message displayed on a display of the UE s in response to that the UE s receive s an alert message having an MID from a first predetermined set of MIDs e.g. the first alert message . In some configurations user alerting may include map related information displayed on the display of the UE s in response to that the UE s receive s an alert message having an MID from a second predetermined set of MIDs e.g. the second alert message as described supra with reference to . Finally at operation the MME may record a success or failure regarding the alert message delivery in a trace record.

At block the UE enables an application and provides the additional information to the application based on the trigger message. For example referring to the UE enables the alert message application and provides the location information included in the additional information to the application based on the MID included in the trigger message . For instance when the MID e.g. 4396 is not one a predetermined set of MIDs e.g. in the range 4370 4382 the UE enables the alert message application and provides the location information to the alert message application .

In some configurations at block the UE determines whether the MID is one of a predetermined set of MIDs. For example referring back to the UE may determine whether the MID is in the range 4370 4382. At block the UE determines to display map related information based on whether the MID is one of the predetermined set of MIDs. For example referring to the UE may determine to display the map related information when the MID is not within the predetermined set of MIDs 4370 4382. When the MID is not within the predetermined set of MIDs 4370 4382 the UE may assume that the message i.e. additional information includes map related information . However the UE may determine to refrain from displaying the map related information when the MID is within the predetermined set of MIDs 4370 4382. When the MID is within the predetermined set of MIDs 4370 4382 the UE may assume that the message i.e. alert message content does not include map related information .

In some configurations at block the UE determines whether previous system information was received. For example referring to the UE may receive previous system information. The UE may determine to display the map related information when the previous system information i.e. the first alert message is received and the location information of the system information i.e. the second alert message is associated with the previous system information. The UE may assume that the system information is associated with the previous system information when the system information is received after the previous system information and has a serial number greater than or equal to the serial number of the previous system information. The UE may determine the association of the system information to the previous system information through other means such as through information within the additional information.

In some configurations the previous system information includes an alert message and the location information is associated with the alert message. In some configurations the previous system information includes an MID within a predetermined set of MIDs e.g. in the range 4370 4382 and the system information includes an MID e.g. 4396 different from the predetermined set of MIDs. In some configurations the system information includes a serial number that is greater than or equal to the serial number of the previous system information.

Finally at block the UE displays map related information associated with the location information. For example referring to the UE may display map related information associated with the location information . In some configurations the location information indicates a geographic area associated with an alert e.g. an earthquake . In some configurations the map related information indicates a geographic area associated with the location information in the system information. For example the map related information may display the geographic area as a 10 mile radius with respect to an earthquake epicenter in downtown San Diego. In some configurations the map related information indicates a geographic location of the UE . For example the map related information may display the geographic location of the UE which is inside of the geographic area . The UE may receive the system information because the geographic location of the UE is inside of the geographic area as illustrated in . However if the geographic location of the UE is not inside of the geographic are the UE may not receive the system information.

The various aspects provided herein may be backward compatible and may have minimal to no impact on existing infrastructures of providers i.e. CMSPs . Further the UE may continue to receive alert messages having an MID within the predetermined range e.g. in the range 4370 4382 while also receiving alert messages not within the predetermined range e.g. 4396 . Additionally third party application developers may provide map related information in various forms and or with various features without deviating from the scope of the present disclosure.
