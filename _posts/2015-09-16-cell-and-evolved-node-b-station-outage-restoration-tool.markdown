This application is a continuation application of and claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 088 719 now U.S. Pat. No. 9 167 453 entitled CELL AND EVOLVED NODE B STATION OUTAGE RESTORATION TOOL and filed on Nov. 25 2013. The entirety of the above referenced U.S. Patent Application is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The disclosed subject matter relates to a real time self healing cell site and evolved Node B eNodeB station device outage restoration tool applicable for example in self organizing networks.

When disruptive and or operational multiple access wireless communication network outage problems occur for example due to natural disasters scheduled and or unscheduled outages and or other unforeseen circumstances restoration of cell sites and or eNodeB stations devices that can control respective cell sites in an orderly fashion can be of paramount importance given the current preference of many in the populace to exclusively employ the functionalities and facilities provided by multiple access wireless communication networks infrastructures.

The subject disclosure is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the subject disclosure. It may be evident however that the subject disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the subject disclosure.

When there is a natural disaster or other operational outage there is a need to prioritize which cell sites and or eNodeB station devices should be remediated first. Currently there is no mechanism to identify the key sites e.g. sites that when revived that would yield the greatest possible benefit to the overall functionality of the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure and or a geographical area particularly or specifically affected by the natural disaster or other operational challenges necessary to bring the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure or a geographic portion thereof back to full functionality.

Currently there is no tool that prioritizes or highlights cell sites sets or groups of cell sites and or sets or groups of eNodeB station devices that should be brought online in preference to other sets or groups of cells sites and or other sets or groups of eNodeB station devices. It should be noted in this regard that for the purposes of the subject disclosure that a set or group of cell sites and or sets or groups of eNodeB station devices is not inclusive of an empty set or a null set.

In order to remedy the foregoing and current omission the subject disclosure provides systems and or a method that rank orders cell sites and or eNodeB station devices that should be brought back or restored in order of greatest import and impact to the functionality of the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure. The subject disclosure rank orders cell sites and or eNodeB station devices as a function of the order in which each cell site and or eNodeB station device should be restored or brought back online thereby ensuring disruptions to the multiple access wireless communication networks infrastructure are obviated or at the very least mitigated and or minimized.

In order to achieve and or facilitate this aim the subject application uses historical data from each cell site and or eNodeB station device to provide a relative ranking of importance of the cell site and or eNodeB station device to the overall facility and or functioning of the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure or a geographical portion thereof that can have suffered a deficiency due to a scheduled or unscheduled network outage or due to a natural disaster or other unscheduled disruption.

The functionality provided by the subject disclosure is performed in real time rather than over an extended period of time. The multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure can be viewed or perceived as a dynamic and mutable entity an entity that is in a perpetual state of flux. For instance certain aspects of a geographically diverse multiple access wireless communication network can be subject to scheduled and or unscheduled outages such that the composition and functionality of the geographically diverse and disparate multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure can change from one instance of time to another instance of time and wherein the likelihood that the entirety of the multiple access wireless communication networks infrastructure will remain statically and identically configured over time is extremely remote. The subject disclosure therefore provides its results in real time and as a function of the alterable and or persistently mutable nature of multiple access wireless communication networks infrastructures.

The subject application takes as input current and historical key performance indicators KPIs values e.g. voice erlangs data traffic short message service SMS traffic carried and or offered loads on the cell site network topology and cell site relation information such as those based on handover HO statistics. The time window and granularity over which information is collected and processed can be variable and can be set by the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure provider operator.

The key performance indicator values employed in the subject disclosure can first be filtered using a generic filtering algorithm process such as simple moving average cumulative moving average weighted moving average exponential weighted moving average and the like which can combine current and historical key performance indicator information within a specified time window to produce a post processed value for the key performance indicator metric that can be denoted as Filtered KPI for each reference cell site j.

The next factor that the subject disclosure can consider is handover statistics the total number of handovers that can have occurred in a defined time window between a reference cell site j and each of its neighbors is filtered and weighted using the same or a similar filtering algorithm process as utilized in the context of key performance indicator values. The post processed handover metric for a particular reference cell site j can be denoted as Filtered HO .

A further factor that can be considered by the subject disclosure can be based on using the network topology wherein a distance weighting factor can be constructed that weights the contributions from neighboring cell sites based on the distance between the reference cell site j and each of its neighbors. This metric can be determined as follows first using the network topology information obtained for example from a database or network topologies typically maintained by a multiple access wireless communication network provider carrier a distance between a reference cell site j and each of its neighboring cell sites defined in the network topology can be determined. This set of distances can be denoted as D. Next using the handover statistics also maintained in one or more databases typically maintained by the multiple access wireless communication network provider carrier the number of neighbor cell sites that have contributed to a percentage value x of the total handovers that have occurred during a defined period of time can be identified. Based on or as a function of the handover statistics and the set of distances between reference cell site j and each of its neighboring cell sites a respective distance from reference cell site j and to each of the neighbor cell sites that have contributed to a percentage value x of the total handovers can be determined. This set of distances can be denoted as D. Using the set of distances D a weighting function for the reference cell site j can be constructed. This weighting function can be denoted as Wwhich measures the cardinality e.g. a measure of the number of elements included in the set of the set of distances D.

Based on the foregoing a cell site ranking score value for a reference cell site j can be constructed as Cell Ranking Score Filtered KPI Filtered HO W. Further using the foregoing cell site ranking score Cell Ranking Score an eNodeB station device ranking score can be determined for a reference eNodeB station device j using the formula eNodeB Ranking Score Cell Ranking Score where Nis the number of cell sites controlled by reference eNodeB station device j.

As has been noted earlier the foregoing determinations and or Cell Ranking Score and or eNodeB Ranking Score can be performed in real time consequently it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill that the subject application can produce results in real time. The subject disclosure as described and disclosed herein therefore efficiently and in real time provides a cell site and or eNodeB station device restoration priority ranking metric the defined metric accounts for all the relevant key performance indicator factors and assigns an optimal weight to each cell site and or to each eNodeB station device to reflect its relative importance and priority for restoration during outage and disaster recovery scenarios. Accordingly the system and methods disclosed and described herein can reduce the cost of restoring and troubleshooting wireless networks through the provision of real time metrics that can aid a network operator to efficiently and quickly identify and repair cell sites and or eNodeB station devices during outage scenarios. This minimizes the time to restore cell sites and or eNodeB station devices and hence to provide wireless coverage to critical areas and improved customer experience.

In accordance with a further embodiment the subject disclosure describes a method comprising a series of acts that include obtaining by a system comprising a processor a historical key performance indicator value topology data representing a network topology and statistical data representing a metric related to a number of transfers of wireless service from a reference cell device to a neighbor cell device applying a filtering process to the historical performance indicator value for the reference cell device to produce a filtered key performance indicator metric for the reference cell device applying the filtering process to the statistical data for the reference cell device to produce a filtered handover metric related to the number of transfers of wireless service from the reference cell device to the neighbor cell device determining a weighting factor for the reference cell device using the topology data and the number of transfers of wireless service from the reference cell device to the neighbor cell device wherein the topology data provides or enables determination of a distance between the reference cell device and the neighbor cell device and initiating display of a cell ranking score for the reference cell device as a function of the weighting factor for the reference cell device the filtered handover metric for the reference cell device and the filtered key performance indicator metric for the reference cell device.

In the context of the filtering process a weighted moving average process or algorithm and or an exponential weighted moving average process or algorithm can be used.

Additionally in accordance with a further embodiment the historical key performance indicator value can be a metric related to an amount of data related to a text message service using the reference cell device as a conduit for communication with a network device associated with a multiple access wireless communication network.

Additional acts that can also include aggregating the cell ranking score for the reference cell device with a cell ranking score determined for the neighbor cell device to determine an eNodeB station device ranking score for a reference eNodeB station device wherein the reference eNodeB station device includes or comprises the reference cell device and initiating display of the eNodeB station device ranking score for the reference eNodeB station device wherein the eNodeB station ranking score is color coded as a function of a priority ordering placed on restoration of the reference eNodeB station device relative to the neighbor cell device included in a geographic segment of a multiple access wireless communication network represented by the topology data.

In accordance with a still further embodiment the subject disclosure describes a computer readable storage device comprising instructions that in response to execution cause a computing system comprising a processor to perform operations. The operation can include filtering a current key performance indicator value for a reference cell device and a historical key performance indicator value for the reference cell device to produce a filtered key performance indicator metric for the reference cell device related to a defined time horizon filtering statistical data to produce filtered statistical data representing a filtered statistic for the reference cell device related to the defined time horizon determining a weighting factor for the reference cell device as a function a distance between the reference cell device and a cell device in proximity to the reference cell device wherein the distance is obtained from topology data representing a network topology that includes or comprises the reference cell device and the cell device in proximity to the reference cell device and initiating display of a ranking score for the reference cell device wherein the ranking score for the reference cell device is determined as a function of the weighting factor for the reference cell device the filtered statistical data for the reference cell device and the filtered key performance indicator metric for the reference cell device.

With reference now to the Figures. illustrates a system for restoring cell site and or evolved Node B eNodeB station devices after a scheduled and or unscheduled outage. System can efficiently and in real time provide cell site and eNodeB station device restoration priority ranking metrics wherein the restoration priority ranking metrics account for all relevant key performance indicator KPI factors and assigns optimal weights to each cell site and or eNodeB station device to reflect the cell site and or eNodeB station device importance and or priority for restoration of service during outages and or disaster recovery scenarios. By using the functionalities and or facilities provided by system reductions in the costs associated with restoring and or troubleshooting multiple access wireless communication networks infrastructures e.g. radio access networks through the provision of real time metrics can be attained. The real time metrics can be utilized or employed by network operators to efficiently and expeditiously identify and repair cell sites and or eNodeB station devices during outage situations thereby minimizing the time necessary to restore cell sites and or eNodeB station devices and providing wireless coverage to critical areas and improved customer experience.

As illustrated in system can include restoration engine that can be coupled to processor memory and storage . As depicted restoration engine can be in communication with processor for facilitating operation of computer executable instructions and components by restoration engine memory for storing data and or the computer executable instructions and components and storage for providing longer term storage of data and or computer executable instructions. Additionally system can also receive input for use manipulation and or transformation by restoration engine to produce one or more useful concrete and tangible result and or transform one or more article to different states or things. Further system can also generate and output the useful concrete and tangible result and or the transformed one or more articles produced by restoration engine as output .

Restoration engine can receive as input current and or historical key performance indicator KPI values. Typically these key performance indicator values can include total voice erlangs e.g. the number of simultaneous users connected to the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure via a cell site and or eNodeB station device provides an indication regarding traffic demand and or the number of simultaneous voice calls that are being serviced or supported by a cell site or eNodeB station device in a defined period of time data traffic traversing through a cell site and or eNodeB station device short message service SMS traffic using a cell site and or eNodeB station device as a conduit for communication carried and offered loads on a cell site and or eNodeB station device and the like. Other data that can be utilized by restoration engine can include network topologies or geographically relevant or specific portions of the multiple access wireless communication network of the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure and cell relationship information such relationship information based on handover statistics e.g. the number of transfers of wireless service from a first cell site and or eNodeB station device to a second cell site and or eNodeB station device . It should noted that the foregoing key performance indicator values network topologies and or cell relationship information such as handover statistics can be retrieved from one or more storage facilities e.g. storage and or local centrally located and or remotely situated databases. In some embodiments of the subject disclosure the storage facilities and associated data can be stored and or co located at a cell site and or eNodeB station device. In other embodiments of the subject disclosure requisite data can have been stored to storage component . In still other embodiments of the subject disclosure the necessary data e.g. key performance indicator values network topologies and cell relationship information can be retrieve and or obtained from databases maintained in a network cloud infrastructure.

With respect to the handover statistics received as input by restoration engine these statistics are typically measured the number of transfers of wireless service from a first cell device to a second cell device and or from a first eNodeB station to a second eNodeB station. The handover statistics are typically retrieved from a database where the handover statistics are stored for each cell device included in the multiple access wireless communication networks infrastructure. The handover statistics provide a handover relationship between different or disparate cells and or eNodeB station devices in the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure. For instance and with reference to and as depicted in reference cell site A and its neighbors cells site cell site cell site cell site cell site and cell site . The handover statistics maintained in the one or more databases can be graphically illustrated as a histogram that illustrates from the perspective of a first cell site e.g. reference cell site A how many handovers have been facilitated or conducted by reference cell site A to each of its neighboring cell sites e.g. cell site cell site cell site cell site cell site and cell site . It should be appreciated that the histographical representation of the handover statistics between the reference cell site and each respective neighboring cell sites is but one illustrative graphical representation that can be utilized and is illustrated in .

As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art the time window and or granularity associated with measurement of the various key performance indicator values can be set by the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure operator carrier. Since a geographically diverse multiple access wireless communication network is a dynamic system that typically remains in a state of flux the operator carrier may wish to utilize a brief time window horizon e.g. a second or fractions thereof a few minutes a half hour an hour . . . over which to provide analysis. Alternatively or optionally the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure operator carrier may wish to set the time window horizon to capture an wider view of the operational history of the geographically diverse multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure e.g. over the last month three months six months nine months etc. . In relation to granularity this aspect can also be set by the multiple access wireless communication network infrastructure provider carrier and typically pertains to the sampling rate for the acquisition of the key performance indicator values persisted or stored in the database e.g. storage . Illustrative sampling rates for the acquisition of key performance indicator values can include collecting respective key performance indicator values every second every minute every thirty minutes every forty five minutes every hour every 90 minutes every six hours every twelve hours and the like.

Restoration engine having received as input key performance indicator values network topologies and or cell site relationship information can apply a generic filtering algorithm process such as a simple moving average algorithm process a weighted moving average algorithm process an exponential moving average algorithm process and the like to filter the key performance indicator values. The generic filtering algorithm process should combine current key performance indicator values with historical key performance indicator values within a specified or defined time window defined time horizon defined time period to produce a post processed value for the key performance indicator metric denoted as Filtered KPI for each reference cell j.

Using the handover statistics e.g. the number of transfers of wireless communications that have occurred in a defined period of time between a reference cell site or reference eNodeB station device and each cell site or each eNodeB station device that neighbors the reference cell site or eNodeB station device retrieved and or obtained as input restoration engine can apply a similar generic filtering algorithm process e.g. a simple moving average algorithm process a weighted moving average algorithm process an exponential moving average algorithm process etc. to the received or obtained handover statistics to produce a processed value for the handover statistics. The post processed handover metric for a reference cell site j can be denoted as Filtered HO .

Additionally restoration engine can construct a distance weighting factor that weights the contributions from neighboring cell sites and or eNodeB station devices based on a distance between a reference cell site j and or eNodeB station device and each of its neighboring cell sites and or eNodeB station devices . The metric generated by restoration engine can be determined as follows first restoration engine using a network topology received as input can determine the distance between a reference cell site j and each of its neighboring cell sites as defined in the network topology. This set of distances can be denoted as D. Next restoration engine using the earlier received handover statistics for example can identify the number of neighbor cell sites that have contributed to a percentage value x of the total handovers that have occurred in a defined unit of time. Based on the percentage value of contribution provided by neighboring cell sites with respect to the reference cell site j and the earlier determined set of distances e.g. D restoration engine can determine the distance from reference cell site j to each neighboring cell site that has contributed to the defined percentage value x of the total number of handovers. This set of distances can be denoted as D. Using the set of distances D restoration engine can construct a weighting function for the reference cell site j. The weighting function can be denoted as Wand measures the cardinality of the set of distances D.

Restoration engine can thereafter determine a cell site ranking score value for the reference cell site j as Cell Ranking Score Filtered KPI Filtered HO W. Restoration engine using the defined cell ranking score can lso adetermine the eNodeB station device ranking score value for a reference eNodeB station device j as eNodeB Ranking Score Cell Ranking Score where Nis the number of cell sites controlled by reference eNodeB station device j. As has been noted above restoration engine and system provides both the cell site ranking score value as well as the eNodeB station device ranking score value in real time.

Using the determined cell site ranking score value as well as the eNodeB station device ranking score value restoration engine in conjunction with a graphical user interface GUI can color code the respective cell site ranking score and eNodeB ranking score to provide operations personnel a better perspective as to the priority or preference ordering in which respective cell sites and or eNodeB station devices should be restored. For instance high priority cell sites and or eNodeB station devices e.g. those cell sites and or eNodeB station devices that are critical or crucial for network operations within a defined geographical area can be represented in red while low priority cell sites and or eNodeB station devices can be represented in a more neutral color such as white. It should be appreciated in regard to display of the color coded ordering or ranking that other color combinations and or color gradations can be utilized without departing from the intent and scope of the subject disclosure.

Preprocessing component on receipt of current and or historical key performance indicator values can filter these values using a generic filtering algorithm process. Examples of such filtering algorithms processes can include a simple moving average algorithm process a cumulative moving average algorithm process a weighted moving average algorithm process an exponential weighted moving average algorithm process and the like. These generic algorithms processes can be utilized by preprocessing component to combine current and or historical key performance indicator information within a defined or specified time window to produce a post processed value for the key performance indicator metric. This metric can be denoted as Filtered KPI for a particular cell site or reference cell site j.

Preprocessing component can also on receipt as input of handover information and or statistics can apply a similar generic filtering algorithm process to the received handover information and or statistics to produce a post processed handover metric. The received handover statistics and or information can include the total number of handovers that have occurred in a defined time window between a reference cell site j and each of its neighboring cell sites wherein this information and or these statistics are filtered and weighted using the generic filtering algorithm process e.g. one or more of a simple moving average algorithm process a cumulative moving average algorithm process a weighted moving average algorithm process an exponential weighted moving average algorithm process and the like . The filtering and weighting of the handover information and or statistics produces a post processed handover metric for a particular reference cell site j can be denoted as Filtered HO .

Preprocessing component can thereafter supply or forward the determined metrics e.g. Filtered KPIand or Filtered HO to ranking component for further processing as described in .

Ranking component can thereafter utilize the ascertained or determined post processed value for the key performance indicator metric e.g. Filtered KPI determined for each reference cell site j the determined or ascertained post processed value for the handover metric for reference cell site j e.g. Filtered HO and the weighting function Wthat measures the cardinality of the further set of distances e.g. D to determine a cell site ranking score value for a reference cell site j e.g. Cell Ranking Score Filtered KPI Filtered HO W . Additionally ranking component using the determined Cell Ranking Score can also determine the eNodeB station device ranking score for a particular reference eNodeB station device. The eNodeB station device ranking score can be determined as eNodeB Ranking Score Cell Ranking Score where Nis the number of cell sites controlled by reference eNodeB station device j. The resultant cell site ranking score value e.g. Cell Ranking Score and the eNodeB station device ranking score e.g. eNodeB Ranking Score can thereafter be conveyed and processed by interface component as described below in .
