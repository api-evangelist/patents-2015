This invention pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of anti apoptotic Mcl 1 protein compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases involving overexpressed or unregulated Mcl 1 protein.

Mcl 1 protein is associated with a number of diseases. There is therefore an existing need in the therapeutic arts for compounds which bind to and inhibit the activity of Mcl 1 protein.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds which inhibit the activity of Mcl 1 protein the compounds having Formula I

 Fam NoxaCF 6 FAM GELEVEFATQLRRFGDKLNF amide SEQ ID NO 1 was made on a 433A automated synthesizer Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. using standard FASTMOC deprotection coupling cycles with 0.25 mmol MBHA Rink amide resin SynPep Dublin Calif. . Cartridges containing N Fmoc amino acids 1 mmol with side chain protection Arg 2 2 5 7 8 pentamethylchroman 6 sulfonyl Asp and Glu tert butyl ester Asn Cys Gln and His trityl Lys and Trp tert butyloxycarbonyl Ser Thr and Tyr tert butyl ether were activated with O benzotriazol 1 yl N N N N tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate 1 mmol 1 hydroxybenzotriazole 1 mmol and diisopropylethylamine 2 mmol in N methylpyrrolidone NMP . The activated amino acid was coupled for 30 minutes following removal of the N terminal Fmoc group with 20 piperidine in NMP. Labeling was accomplished by suspending the resin bound N terminally deprotected side chain protected peptide resin 0.04 mmol and 6 carboxyfluorescein NHS ester 57 mg in anhydrous dimethylformamide 2 mL containing 0.02 mL diisopropylethylamine DIEA and shaking at ambient temperature overnight. The resin was drained washed 3 times with 1 1 dichloromethane methanol and dried. The labeled resin was cleaved and deprotected by mixing with TFA water thioanisole phenol 3 6 dioxa 1 8 octanedithiol triisopropylsilane 80 5 5 5 2.5 2.5 for 3 hours at ambient temperature. Following evaporation under reduced pressure the crude peptide was recovered by precipitation with ether. The product was purified on a preparative HPLC running Unipoint analysis software Gilson Inc. Middleton Wis. on a 25 mm 200 mm radial compression column containing Delta Pak Cpacking Waters Inc. Taunton Mass. with a flow rate of 20 mL min. The peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 TFA water and acetonitrile. Fractions containing the pproduct were combined and lyophilized. The purity of the final products were confirmed by reverse phase analytical HPLC on a Hewlett Packard 1050 series system with diode array and fluorescence detection Agilent Technologies Palo Alto Calif. eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid water and acetonitrile on a 4.6 250 mm YMC ODS AQ 5 m 120 column Waters Inc. to give the product 45.6 mg as a yellow powder following lyophilization.

A fluorescence polarization assay was used for ICdetermination of representative compounds having Formula I against recombinant Mcl 1 protein. Compounds were series diluted in DMSO starting at 10 M and transferred 5 L into a 96 well plate. Then 120 L of a mixture containing 10 nM fluorescent Noxa BH3 peptide and 80 nM Mcl 1 protein was added to each well. For each assay free peptide controls fluorescent peptide only and bound peptide controls fluorescent peptide in the presence of Mcl 1 were included on each assay plate. The plate was mixed on a shaker for 1 minute and incubated at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes. The polarization in mP was measured at room temperature with excitation wavelength at 485 nm and emission wavelength at 530 nm using an Analyst LJL Molecular Dynamic Sunnyvale Calif. . The percentage inhibition was calculated by inhibition 100 1 mP mP mP mP in which mPis the free peptide control and mPis the bound peptide control. Based on percentage of inhibition the IC inhibitor concentration at which 50 of bound peptide is displaced obtained by fitting the inhibition data using Prism 3.0 software Graphpad Software Inc San Diego Calif. . The results are shown in TABLE 1.
