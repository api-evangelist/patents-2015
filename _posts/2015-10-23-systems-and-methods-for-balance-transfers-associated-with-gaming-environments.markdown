This application is a continuation of prior application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 326 527 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR BALANCE TRANSFERS ASSOCIATED WITH GAMING ENVIRONMENTS filed on Jul. 9 2014 which is a continuation in part of prior application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 228 363 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF NON WAGERING ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH GAMING ENVIRONMENT filed on Mar. 28 2014 which is a continuation of prior application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 033 493 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF NON WAGERING ACCOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH GAMING ENVIRONMENT filed Sep. 22 2013 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 708 809 which claims priority to the disclosure of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 744 564 entitled DUAL PREPAID LOYALTY CARD FOR GAMING filed Sep. 28 2012 the disclosures of which are all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Within gaming establishments such as casinos gaming devices are typically networked via a central computer. Such configuration allows for the gaming establishment to monitor a player s gameplay for tracking purposes. Gaming devices typically issue paper tickets that are redeemable for cash. These paper tickets can be redeemed either at assisted service counters i.e. a casino cage or through self service computer systems sometimes called Ticket In Ticket Out TITO machines. Drawbacks of using paper tickets however is that the players may very easily lose tickets tickets can become destroyed or damaged casinos incur cost from replenishing tickets and casinos incur cost for maintaining ticket printers. Additionally the use of tickets requires that operators of casinos ensure that sufficient amounts of cash are available on the gaming floor to accommodate redemptions at both the assisted service counters and the TITO machines. Players wishing to play a table game at a casino typically first exchange cash for an amount of chips which can then be used for gaming. When the player wants to convert the chips back to the cash the player typically exchanges their chips for an equivalent amount of cash at a cashier cage at the casino. Thus in addition to ensure sufficient cash is available for ticket redemptions operators of casinos must ensure also sufficient amounts of cash are available at the cashier cage to accommodate player exchanging chips for cash. This process for routinely replenishing cash by the casino operator is both costly and burdensome.

Additionally in many gaming establishments players can register demographic information to obtain a player card sometimes referred to as a loyalty card. Typical player cards include a unique identifier that enables the casino to centrally track the player s wagering activity. Applying the player s historic activity the gaming establishment can for example develop a targeted marketing campaign including promotions gifts and advertisements. A problem with casino loyalty systems however is that they do not capture spending player activity that occurs in non gaming environments such the player s purchases at a merchant or the player s ATM activity.

Therefore the field can benefit from systems and methods providing cashless wagering and redemption which provides advantages to both game players and casino operators. The field can also benefit from systems and methods that conveniently allow a gaming establishment to track player gaming activity and player purchase activity both inside and outside the casino to associate such activity with the player s loyalty profile.

In an embodiment the present disclosure is directed in part to a computer based computer based method of transferring funds between a stored value account and a gaming account. The method comprises receiving by one or more processors player credentials for a player wherein the player credentials are associated with a player identifier and a gaming account having a balance wherein the player credentials were entered into a remote computing device. The method further comprises based at least partially on the player identifier identifying by any of the one or more processors a stored value account wherein the stored value account is associated with a stored value payment vehicle issued to the player and wherein a balance of the stored value account is maintained by an issuer processor computing system. The method further comprises receiving by any of the one or more processors a funding instruction wherein the funding instruction identifies a balance amount to be transferred from the stored valued account to the gaming account wherein the funding instruction was entered into the remote computing device. The method further comprises causing by any of the one or more processors a decrease of the balance of the stored value account and an increase of the balance of the gaming account.

In another embodiment the present disclosure is directed in part to a computer based method of funding an account associated with a player. The method comprises receiving by a transaction facilitator computing system a load request wherein the load request is initiated at an application executed on a remote computing device and comprises a request to fund a gaming account with player funds held by a stored value account associated with a stored value payment vehicle wherein the gaming account has a balance amount. The method also comprises causing by the transaction facilitator computing system an increase of the balance amount of the gaming account based on an amount of funds requested in the load request.

In another embodiment the present disclosure is directed in part to a gaming account funding system. The gaming account funding system comprises a stored value payment vehicle issued to a player wherein funds accessible by the stored value payment vehicle are maintained in a stored value account and are accessible through a payment network. The gaming account funding system also comprises a gaming account to hold funds for the player and a loyalty account assigned to the player wherein the loyalty account is maintained by a customer management system wherein the loyalty account assigned to the player is associated with the stored value account. The gaming account funding system also comprises at least one processor and non transitory computer readable medium having instructions stored thereon which when executed by a processor cause the processor to selectively increase and decrease funds held by the stored value account and the gaming account based on one funding commands provided by the player through an application executing on a remote computing device.

The presently disclosed system and methods can generally allow for gaming related financial transactions. As described in more detail below utilizing a financial facilitator a player can selectively transfer funds between various types of gaming accounts and an associated account such as a stored value account and or a casino level player account. The stored value account can be a financial account that is maintained by an issuing financial institution with funds in the stored value account accessible to the cardholder through an associated stored value payment vehicle using open loop or closed loop payment processing for example. The stored value payment vehicle can be any suitable payment vehicle such as a physical card a virtual payment device or have any other suitable format. In some embodiments the stored value payment vehicle is a general purpose reloadable prepaid card.

Gaming environments can utilize different types of gaming accounts such as casino level player accounts and or wagering accounts. With regard to wagering accounts some types of wagering accounts are regulated by jurisdictional gaming statutes. For the purposes of illustration three different types of wagering accounts are described herein internet gaming wagering accounts brick and mortar wagering accounts and race and sports wagering accounts although this disclosure is not so limited. In fact the systems and methods described herein are generally applicable to the transfer of between any suitable wagering account and an associated stored value account or intermediary account such as a casino level player account as described below.

As used herein internet gaming wagering account or iGaming wagering account generally means an electronic ledger wherein the following types of transactions relative to internet or mobile gaming system are recorded a deposits b withdrawals c amounts wagered d amounts paid on winning wagers e service or other transaction related charges authorized by the patron and f adjustments to the account.

As used herein brick and mortar wagering account generally means an electronic ledger for a brick and mortar cashless wagering system patron deposit account wherein the following types of transactions are recorded to and from gaming devices i.e. slots a deposits and withdrawals of cash or cash equivalents at a designated area of accountability b deposits initiated with a debit instrument c wagering account transfers to and from gaming devices d wagering account adjustments.

As used herein race and sports wagering account generally means an electronic ledger wherein the following types of transactions relative to sports and non pari mutuel race wagers are recorded a deposits b withdrawals c amounts wagered d amounts paid on winning wagers e amounts paid for horse racing related services or merchandise f service or other transaction related charges authorized by the patron and g adjustments to the account.

As described in more detail below a financial facilitator can generally direct or enable transactions with the issuing financial institution to affect the increasing and decreasing of an account balance of the stored value account. A financial facilitator can also generally direct or enable transactions with a computing system that manages a gaming account of a gaming environment to affect the increasing and decreasing of an account balance of the gaming account. The issuing financial institution can also receive communications related to the stored value account in a traditional fashion via an open system from merchants through existing bank card networks. Such communications can authorize decline purchases using funds held in the stored value account.

In some embodiments a player can be associated with a unique player identifier that can be used by a casino or other gaming environment to identify a particular player. Such a player identifier may be issued subsequent to the player enrolling in a casino loyalty program for example. In some cases the unique player identifier is embossed on a player card sometimes referred to as a loyalty card or is otherwise accessible or presentable by a player. In some embodiments the player identifier can be a graphical code such as a quick response QR code displayable on a mobile computing device or the player identifier can be a barcode printed on a keychain fob or other substrate. In any event the player identifier can be provided to a gaming device or casino representative to enable the casino to centrally track the player s wagering activity. The player identifier is linked by the issuing entity such as a casino a loyalty profile that can be stored or otherwise maintained by customer relationship software that is maintained by the casino or on behalf of the casino by an affiliated service provider.

As described in more detail below a player identifier for a particular player can be linked to or otherwise associated with a stored value account held by a financial institution and accessible by the particular player. Such a linkage or association offers a variety of benefits both to players and an associated casino. For example in one example implementation a player can interact with a gaming device such as a slot machine by providing a player identifier to the device. In some cases additional credentials such as a PIN or password can be provided by the player. Through network communications the gaming device can communicate with various computing platforms such as a slot management system and or casino management system which generally may be referred to as a casino computing system to authenticate the player s identity. Once authenticated the player can selectively access funds that are maintained in the stored value account of an issuing financial institution for use at the gaming device. The casino computing system can communicate with a transaction facilitator such as through API calls or other suitable communication techniques to provide the information to identify the player that is seeking to access funds. In one embodiment a player identifier of the player is provided to the transaction facilitator. As described in more detail below the player identifier can be the loyalty account number or other type of identifier. The transaction facilitator in turn can determine a stored value account associated with that player and through closed network communications with the issuing financial institution dispatch appropriate messaging to debit the stored value account. Indication of a successful debit can be provided to the casino computing system by the transaction facilitator. The casino computing system can then credit a one or more gaming accounts of the player to increase their available balance. Funds in the form of gaming credits can then be distributed to the gaming device sometimes referred to as a wagering account transfer in WAT in . At a later point in time when the player wishes to cash out the credits of the gaming device can be transferred to a gaming account sometimes referred to as a wagering account transfer out WAT out . Once received into the gaming account the gaming credits can be converted to a fund amount and used to credit the stored value account held in the gaming account or even transferred to another gaming account.

In some embodiments various transfers described below can be performed in substantially real time. As used herein substantially real time means generally less than about 20 minutes generally less than about 10 minutes generally less that about 5 minutes generally less than about 1 minutes or generally less than about 30 seconds. Therefore in the example described above subsequent to the player cashing out the funds transferred to the stored value account can be accessible to make purchases using the associated stored value payment vehicle in substantially real time

The stored value payment vehicle can be for example a general purpose reloadable card sometimes referred to as a GPR card that is an open loop payment vehicle. Being an open loop payment vehicle it is associated with a bank card network MASTERCARD VISA DISCOVER and so forth and can generally be used at any merchant or ATM accepting payment cards associated with the bank card network. Open loop transactions seeking authorization from funds of the stored value account send authorization requests to the issuing financial institution through an open bank card network. In accordance with the systems and methods disclosed herein using secured communication links the issuing financial institution can provide a financial facilitator with information based on stored value card transactions. The financial facilitator can determine a player identifier associated with that stored value account and then provide reporting to the casino computing system. This reporting can be used for example to supplement or update a loyalty profile of a player based on the increased knowledge about the player gained from tracking their spending.

Embodiments are hereinafter described in detail in connection wherein like numbers indicate the same or corresponding elements throughout the figures. It is noted that reference throughout the specification to various embodiments some embodiments one embodiment some example embodiments one example embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus appearances of the phrases in various embodiments in some embodiments in one embodiment some example embodiments one example embodiment or in an embodiment in places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore the particular features structures or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.

Referring now to a player can be issued the stored value payment vehicle that is associated with a stored value account maintained by an issuer processor computing system . The issuer processor computing system can be a system used to maintain and or process transactions associated with the stored value payment vehicle and the stored value account . The stored value payment vehicle can be a physical card a virtual card or any other suitable type of vehicle. In some embodiments the stored value payment vehicle is a general purpose reloadable card sometimes referred to as a prepaid card . The stored value payment vehicle can be an open loop card which a consumer can use anywhere that accepts payment from a retail electronic payments network associated with the stored value payment vehicle such as MASTERCARD VISA DISCOVER and so forth as discussed above. The stored value payment vehicle can be a closed loop card which a consumer can use at particular merchant locations for example. The player can fund i.e. increase the available balance the stored value account through traditional techniques such as by transfers funds from a demand access account DDA and or funds loaded from a credit card to the stored value account through an online interface. As described in more detail below the player can also selectively fund the stored value account from the gaming environment using cash jackpot payouts and numerous other ways such as chip and slot ticket redemption.

The stored value payment vehicle can be used by the player to make purchases at a variety of merchant types. As shown in non limiting example types of merchants include a brick and mortar merchant an online merchant an ATM machine and a service provider . Accordingly the stored value payment vehicle can be used to facilitate the transfer of funds from the stored value account through purchase transactions schematically illustrated as transactions and . In some cases a particular merchant may be associated with the gaming environment such as affiliated merchant . Example affiliated merchants can include without limitation on property retailers restaurants and hotels. While the affiliated merchant is illustrated as being within the gaming environment this disclosure is not so limited. In some embodiments the affiliated merchant is an online merchant for example. The stored value payment vehicle can be used for a purchase transaction at such affiliated merchants . In some embodiments the purchase transaction can be processed as a closed loop transaction due to the affiliation with the gaming environment or a transaction facilitator as described below. As described in more detail below the systems and methods described herein can allow for such a purchase transaction by the player to be incentive and or rewarded. The purchase transactions and by the player can also be rewarded with reward levels being the same or different as the rewards or comps associated with purchase transaction .

A gaming account can be associated with the casino environment . As used herein a gaming account can be any type of financial account i.e. electronic ledger that is associated with a player or collection of financial accounts that are associated with a player and maintained by a casino or at least on behalf of a casino. While schematically shows one gaming account for the sake of clarity it is to be appreciated that the player and or the stored value payment vehicle can be associated with any number of gaming accounts . Further the gaming account can be any suitable account type. In for example the gaming accounts associated with the play are illustrated as wagering accounts . In other embodiments such as described below in connection with and for example the gaming account can comprise a casino level player account. Still referring to In accordance with the systems and methods described herein the player can selectively direct funds A associated with the stored value payment vehicle to the gaming account . The player can also selectively direct funds B associated with the gaming account to the stored value payment vehicle . In other words in accordance with the disclosure the player can transfer funds back and forth in real time between a stored value account and the gaming account of the player . In some embodiments the directed funds A B are transferred i.e. credited to the destination account in substantially real time. In other embodiments a pause between an initiated transfer and an availability of the transferred funds can be implemented. For example to the extent that regulators and responsible gaming advocates believe that a pause is significant to minimize reckless gaming the systems and methods described herein are adaptable to institute certain pauses in accessing funds.

In one example embodiment using directed funds A B a player can supply funds for a gaming experience within the gaming environment and subsequently cash out from the gaming experience all without physically handling cash or coins within the gaming environment . Since all of the funds are electronically transferred between a selected gaming account and the stored value account as credits and debits for these particular transactions the necessity for the player or the gaming environment to physically handle cash or coins is eliminated. In other embodiments however the player bring cash or coins into the gaming environment and selectively transfer such funds to their stored value account as described in more detail below see for example . Additionally in other embodiments the player withdraw cash from their stored value account while in the gaming environment as described in more detail below see for example .

Referring again to gaming accounts associated with the player are shown as wagering accounts which can be managed by management computing system not shown affiliated with the gaming environment . In the illustrated embodiment the wagering accounts include a brick and mortar wagering account a race and sport wagering account and an iGaming wagering account . The brick and mortar wagering account is generally an electronic ledger associated with a player s table and slot wagers. The race and sport wagering account is generally an electronic ledger associated with a player s sports and non pari mutuel race wagers. The iGaming wagering account is generally an electronic ledger associated with a player s online wagers such as online poker and virtual gaming. It is noted that in some jurisdictions gaming regulations forbid the transferring of a player s funds stored in one wagering account directly to another wagering account 

In this embodiment the gaming environment is linked to a player loyalty database which stores data in the form of a player loyalty profile associated with the player . The player loyalty profile can include data associated with the gaming history of the player incentives comps and other tracking related information as is known in the art. The loyalty profile can also include information related to fund transfer data as illustrated by data capturing . Accordingly the player loyalty profile can include for example dates of transfers amounts of transfers times of transfers number of transfers and so forth.

The gaming system can comprise one or more gaming accounts shown as a single gaming account in for the sake of illustration . While the gaming account is schematically shown within the CMS other gaming environments can maintain the gaming account elsewhere such as by a separate wagering account management entity or a third party wagering account provider. In the illustrated embodiment the gaming account comprises a brick and mortar gaming account so that gaming credits can be provided to the meter of the gaming device as described below.

A stored value payment vehicle such as a prepaid debit card or other suitable type of payment vehicle is issued to the player by a bank or other financial entity. A player identifier is also assigned to the player so that an operator of the gaming environment can properly identify the player . In some embodiment the player identifier is expressed as a number or string that is provided to the player on a physical card such as a loyalty card or player s card . In other embodiments the player identifier can be graphical based or be chip based and utilize near field communication NFC protocols for example. In any event as illustrated in the player identifier is provided to an input device of the gaming device . As is to be appreciated the particular type of input device used to read the player identifier will depend on the particular format of the player identifier . In some embodiments the input device is a magnetic card reader while in other embodiments the input device is an optical scanner. In some embodiments in addition to providing the player identifier additional credentials such as a PIN must be provided by the player for authentication purposes. Further while not illustrated it is noted that in some embodiments the gaming device can be configured to read or scan the stored value payment vehicle .

Upon receiving the player identifier along with any other credentials the gaming device provides the data to the SMS and or the CMS through network communications. Upon authenticating the identification of the player various types of financial transactions related to the stored value payment vehicle and or the gaming account can be offered to the player . In some embodiments such offerings are provided on a graphical display on the gaming device as provided to the gaming device by communications from the SMS and or CMS . In one embodiment for example an available balance in a stored value account associated with the stored value payment vehicle is displayed to the player . Additional details regarding the retrieval of the available balance using a transaction facilitator is described in more detail below with regard to . The gaming device can request a dollar amount be inputted by the player and once the player selects a dollar amount a transfer of funds A can be initiated to direct funds associated with the stored value payment vehicle to the gaming account . Depending on the type of gaming account associated with the player the funds can be transferred directly into a wagering account associated with the gaming device . Alternatively funds can be received in a casino level player account and subsequently transferred to a wagering account associated with the gaming device . In any event upon receipt of the funds A the funds can be converted to gaming credits. The gaming credits can then be metered into gaming device by its meter . The player can then use the gaming credits for wagering at the gaming device as is known in the art.

At the conclusion of a gaming session the player may desire to transfer any gaming credits to the stored value payment vehicle in the form of funds. In one embodiment when the player initiates a cash out action at the gaming device the gaming device prompts the player to select the cash out technique such as printing a ticket for subsequent redemption or a transfer to the stored value account that is associated with the stored value payment vehicle . Should the player choose the latter the gaming credits can be first transferred out of the gaming device and into the gaming account where it is converted to funds. Then a transfer of funds B is initiated using a closed loop communications with the financial institution maintaining the stored value account to credit that account. As described in more detail below a transaction facilitator not shown can be used to facilitate the transmission of such credit and debit messaging. From the perspective of the player the gaming credits that had been associated with the gaming device are converted to funds that are available for access by the player s stored value payment vehicle . Such conversion of gaming credits to available funds for access by the stored value payment vehicle can be in substantially real time.

Similar to input of the player identifier described in a player identifier associated with the player can be provided to the input device of a gaming device . The gaming device can have one or more displays . The player identifier can be used to identify a player loyalty profile of the player. The casino computing system can be configured to transmit the player identifier or other player identifying data to the transaction facilitator using a suitable network interface .

Upon receiving the player identifier or other player identifying data the transaction facilitator can match the player identifying data to a particular stored value account as can be maintained by a player database . While the player database is illustrated as a component of the transaction facilitator this disclosure is not so limited. Such information can be stored by any suitable entity in the system hierarchy including by an entity within the gaming environment . It is noted however that by maintaining the player database outside the gaming environment Payment Card Industry PCI compliance requirements of the gaming environment may be reduced.

Once the stored value account of the player has been identified by the transaction facilitator the transaction facilitator can transmit the appropriate messaging to the issuer processor computing system . For example messages may include a balance inquiry an authorization request and so forth. For fund transfers the transaction facilitator can facilitate the message flow to affect the transfers of funds A by debiting the stored value account and crediting the gaming account or the message flow to affect the transfers of funds B by debiting the gaming account and crediting the stored value account . As described above funds transferred into the gaming account can be converted to gaming credits for gaming at the gaming device . Alternatively depending on the type of the gaming account the funds can be used for other types of gaming such as iGaming race and sports gaming and so forth.

One deficiency of typical casino loyalty systems is that they cannot capture patron spending behavior that occurs in non gaming environments such as in casino related restaurants hotel retail stores ATM and so forth. Casino loyalty systems also do not capture spending behavior outside their physical property. Therefore it may be desirable for casinos and other gaming environments to expand their customer s loyalty programs i.e. point earning capability to include related non gaming activity. These expanded programs may encourage greater loyalty and patronage of the casino while also providing additional business intelligence regarding consumer behavior.

In some embodiments additionally or alternatively to the player initiating balance transfers through interactions with the gaming device the player can interact with an application executing on a computing device to initiate various balance transfers. Through these interactions the player can for example cause the transfer of funds stored by the stored value account to the gaming account and vice versa. depicts an example system diagram that includes a remote computing device executing an application for facilitating such balance transfers. The remote computing device can be any suitable networked computing device such as without limitation a smart phone a tablet computer a desktop computer a laptop computer a gaming device a wearable computing device a kiosk an ATM and so forth. The remote computing device can execute an application that generally facilitates the transferring of balances at the player s direction to any number of gaming accounts . The application can be a web browser or specialized software that is installed on or otherwise accessible by the remote computing device . The application can provide one or more interfaces that allow for the player to direct balance transfers between various accounts such as the stored value account and the gaming account . In some embodiments the application can provide instructions to the transaction facilitator which in turn provides the necessary calls to the issuer processor computing system and casino computing system to provide the transfers of balances as schematically illustrated at A and B.

One non limiting operational example will now be described for illustration purposes only. In this operational example the player is holding funds in the stored value account that are accessible by the stored value payment vehicle . While inside or outside the gaming environment the player executes the application on the remote computing device . The application can be in accordance with one non limiting example a mobile application executing on a mobile device. Upon executing the application the player can be asked to supply various credentials or identifiers. In the illustrated embodiment the player is asked to supply their player identifier using an input device . As is to be appreciated the input device can be any suitable device such as a key pad or optical scanner for example. The application can then present one or more transfer options to the player through a graphical user interface. The player can than select the option related to transferring funds from the stored value account to the gaming account . In some embodiments an account balance of the stored value account can be displayed by the application .

Using the input device the player can enter a balance that is to be transferred from the stored value account to the gaming account . In some embodiments the player can be asked to enter additional credentials such as a Personal Identification Number PIN . The PIN can be the PIN associated with the player s loyalty account and or the application for example. The application can then communicate such request to the transaction facilitator which can then submit a withdraw request to the issuer processor computing system . Prior to submitting the withdraw request the transaction facilitator can match the player identifying data to a particular stored value account as can be maintained by a player database as described above. The requested balance of funds can then be transferred to the gaming account from the stored value account . This transferred balance can be accessible to the player for use at gaming devices associated with the gaming account . The balance can be accessible in generally real time or in some implementations subsequent to the passage of a period of time. Furthermore while illustrates that the balance of a single gaming account is increased in response to a user input via the remote computing device such arrangement is merely shown for pedagogical purposes as the remote computing device can be used to increase the number of a plurality of different gaming accounts . Furthermore the gaming accounts can be any type of gaming account such as brick and mortar gaming account a race and sport gaming account and an iGaming gaming account for example. In some embodiments the remote computing device can execute multiple applications that are each affiliated with a separate gaming environment . In some embodiments the application can be usable to effectuate balance transfers to a plurality of gaming accounts across a plurality of gaming environments.

When the player interacts with a gaming device such as a gaming device the player identifier can be provided to the input device as described above. Upon communicating with the casino computing system the gaming device can display the balance of the gaming account . The player can then select an amount of that balance to be converted to gaming credits for gameplay at the gaming device .

At the conclusion of gameplay the gaming credits can be returned to the gaming account as described herein to increase its balance. The player can then utilize the application to effectuate the transfer of some or all of that balance from the gaming account to the stored value account . For example the player can execute the application and select the appropriate option for transferring a balance from the gaming account to the stored value account . Once transferred the funds can be accessible by the player through the use of the stored value payment vehicle .

The stored value payment vehicle can be used for financial transactions at a variety of locations such as an unaffiliated merchant or an ATM machine . These transactions can use traditional open loop payment network communications to seek authorizations from the issuer processor computing system associated with the stored value payment vehicle as is known in the art. The stored value payment vehicle can also be used at an affiliated merchant such as at a casino hotel or restaurant. Depending on the acquirer processor used by the merchants the transaction may be routed to the issuer processor computing system through either open loop network communication links or closed loop network communication links.

For both types of transactions data regarding these transactions can be provided to the transaction facilitator . Upon receiving or in some cases retrieving transactional data a player tracking engine can determine a loyalty profile account associated with the cardholder. In some embodiments the player tracking engine utilizes a player database which may be similar to the player database shown in . The transaction facilitator can then dispatch an intelligence report to the casino computing system or otherwise make the intelligence report available to the casino computing system . The intelligence report can be in a variety of different forms and include a wide variety of information. The intelligence report can be for example data provided to a casino computing system and or customer relationship platform. The intelligence report can be provided using any suitable distribution technique and may vary based on implementation. For example the intelligence report can be provided as a data feed in some embodiments. In other embodiments the intelligence report can be provided as a data file or other type of file. In some embodiments the intelligence report includes identifications of the various merchants where the player used or attempted to use the stored value payment vehicle .

In some embodiments the player tracking engine can be configured to assign a loyalty value such as using a point system or other metric to various transactions involving the stored value payment vehicle or the player based on the transactions of the stored value payment vehicle . Transactions at a first set of merchants as identifiable by a merchant category code received from a POS device may receive a higher point value or different value metric than transactions received from a second set of merchants. In the context of the illustrated embodiment financial transactions at the affiliated merchant can provide the player with more loyalty points than financial transactions at the unaffiliated merchant . In some cases the transaction at the unaffiliated merchant may have zero loyalty value or even have a negative loyalty value. For example the unaffiliated merchant may be a merchant at a competing casino. Based on the incentivized behavior the player may decide not to use the stored value payment vehicle at unaffiliated merchant and instead use it at affiliated merchant .

The player tracking engine can accumulate points or other loyalty data values for the player for a particular period and then provide a reporting of the points in the intelligence report . Based on the points values or other metrics incentives can be provided to the player through the player loyalty program.

In accordance with certain embodiments a couponing engine can allow for the distribution of merchant specific coupons as part of a loyalty program. The couponing engine can store a table for example correlating the stored value payment vehicle to particular discounts coupons or offers as part of a loyalty program collectively referred to as coupons at particular merchants which may be both affiliated and unaffiliated. When an authorization request is received by the issuer processor computing system from a POS device associated with a merchant which may be an affiliated or unaffiliated merchant the issuer processor computing system can query the couponing engine to see if a coupon or other offering is available.

By way of example a player may have a received a coupon from a casino for 10 off a meal at a specific restaurant. For this example the player has an available balance of 100 in their stored value account . The player dines at the restaurant and charges 50 to their stored value payment vehicle . The POS device seeks authorization from the issuer processor computing system as is known in the art. Upon receiving the authorization request the issuer processor computing system uses the couponing engine to see if a coupon is available for use in this case based on the cardholder and the merchant . The 10 off a meal coupon is identified as being applicable. The issuer processor computing system returns a message to the POS device at the restaurant authorizing the full 50 charge. The stored value account however is only debited 40 thereby taking the available balance to 60. Accordingly a coupon was automatically applied to the open loop transaction using the stored value payment vehicle without needing the merchant to apply the coupon to the sale. Once the coupon is applied to a transaction the player tracking engine can report the redemption of the coupon in the intelligence report or using other forms of reporting.

Players using the systems and methods described herein in a gaming environment may desire to load funds into their stored value account. It may be desirable to load such funds in substantially real time so that the funds are accessible via their stored value payment vehicle relatively quickly. schematically illustrates various techniques for a player to load funds to a stored value account that is associated with a stored value payment vehicle . The player can utilize any number of fund sources including player sourced funds and jackpot funds . Referring first to the player sourced funds a player can approach a computing system of the casino environment with the funds . The computing system may be for example an attended computing system such as a casino cage or an unattended computing system such as at a kiosk . The type of computing system will determine which type of funding module can be executed. For example the cage module may allow for a player to load both chips and cash into their stored value account . The cage module may also allow for the player to load a jackpot into their stored value account which is described in more detail below with regard to . The kiosk module may only allow for a player to load cash coins or tickets to their stored value account . A pit module which can be executed on a computing system accessible by a dealer or a pit boss can allow for the loading of a stored value account using chips. A mobile module may be executing on a mobile computing device such as a tablet computer that can read tickets. In some embodiments the mobile module can facilitate a player transferring funds to from the stored value account to from a gaming account i.e. an iGaming wagering account . If the computing device is part of a gaming device the slot module can allow for the funding of the stored value account through gaming credits as described above .

The computing system can communicate with a transaction facilitator through network communications as described above. The transaction facilitator can be provided using any suitable processor based device or system such as a personal computer laptop server mainframe or a collection e.g. network of multiple computers for example. The transaction facilitator can include one or more processors and one or more computer memory units . For convenience only one processor and only one memory unit are shown in . The processor can execute software instructions stored on the memory unit . The processor can be implemented as an integrated circuit IC having one or multiple cores. The memory unit can include volatile and or non volatile memory units. Volatile memory units can include random access memory RAM for example. Non volatile memory units can include read only memory ROM for example as well as mechanical non volatile memory systems such as for example a hard disk drive an optical disk drive etc. The RAM and or ROM memory units can be implemented as discrete memory ICs for example.

In some embodiments a server can provide a graphical web user interface through which various users such as players casino operators and so forth can interact with the transaction facilitator . The server can accept requests such as HTTP requests from clients such as a web browser on the computing system and serve the clients responses. In some embodiments the server can provide a user interface for users who do not communicate with the transaction facilitator using a web browser. Such users can have special software installed on their computing system that allows them to communicate with the transaction facilitator via the network.

Similar to the transaction facilitator of the transaction facilitator can include various computing components such as a web server an application server a memory unit and a processor . Computing devices contacting the transaction facilitator can each be assigned an identifier such as a Device ID. Using the Device ID the transaction facilitator can determine which module to execute based on permissions or functionality associated with that Device ID. In the illustrated embodiment the transaction facilitator has a module for computing devices that are associated with casino kiosks as well as a module for computing devices associated with a gaming pit and computing devices associated with the casino cage. As described above the particular functionality offered at these different computing devices can differ.

Still referring to example simplified screen displays A E of the computing device associated with the casino cage are shown. Referring first to home screen A a variety of options are displayed including load funds load jackpot withdraw funds and search. As illustrated the load funds option has been selected. At screen B the user is prompted to identify if the funds will be loaded to an existing stored value payment vehicle or if a new stored value payment vehicle will need to be issued prior to loading. As illustrated the existing card option has been selected. At screen C player identification information is received such as name address and so forth. Additionally the card information for the existing card is provided to the system. The stored value payment vehicle can be physically swiped or otherwise read by the computing device or the card information can be manually typed. Next a screen D is provided which optionally allows the operator to identify the particular type of funds that the player is providing. For example source can be chips and source can be cash. Other sources may be delineated on the screen as well. Itemizing the type of funds may be beneficial for internal auditing or tracking purposes. The funds are totaled to determine the total load amount and the computing device communicates a load funds message to the transaction facilitator for the amount of funds tendered by the player less any processing fees. Upon successfully crediting the stored value account the transaction facilitator can provide an approval number and other transaction information for display on a transaction approval screen E.

Referring now to screen L of the load jackpot option has been selected. Similar to screen G screen M allows an operator to select whether the jackpot will be loaded to an existing card or a new card. In this embodiment the existing option has been selected. At screen N player identification information is received such as name address and so forth. Additionally the card information for the existing card is provided to the system. The stored value payment vehicle can be physically swiped or otherwise read by the computing device or the card information can be manually typed. Now that the player has provided their stored value payment vehicle number that is linked to a stored value account the player is asked at screen O to provide a jackpot ID and jackpot amount. Once the jackpot has been validated the computing device communicates a load funds message to the transaction facilitator for the amount of the jackpot payout less any processing fees. Upon successfully crediting the stored value account the transaction facilitator can provide an approval number and other transaction information for display on a transaction approval screen P.

Referring now to screen Q of the withdraw funds option has been selected. Using this option a player can access funds that are stored by the issuer processor computing system in the stored value account . At screen R cardholder information such as name and address is received and at screen S the card number and other security related data can be received. In some embodiments the transaction facilitator can perform a balance check and report via the computing device the amount of funds available for withdraw. At screen T the amount of funds associated processing fee and total amount is withdraw is itemized. The transaction facilitator then dispatches the appropriate messaging to the issuer processor computing system to debit the stored value account accordingly. Similar to other embodiments a transaction approval screen U can report data regarding the withdrawal.

Referring now to screen V of the search option has been selected. Selection of the search option accesses a transaction database that is displayed on W. It is noted that the transaction database illustrated in has been simplified for the sake of clarity. The transaction database may be maintained by the transaction facilitator or may be stored by the computing device or associated computing system. In any event the transaction database stores transactions processed by the transaction facilitator and allows sorting or searching by transaction date transaction type patron name transaction amount and transaction status . Additionally the data can be manipulated based on username device type and based on a time period .
